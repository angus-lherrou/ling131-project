ominous\nNews from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked it a bit\nLater on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think\nIn the lead group of science reporters\nPeople who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I\nI I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific how men play you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very good at it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear\nFor somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America corny corny Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook\nBasically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I walked me had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back alive\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can er can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned lake ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and

former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book is ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nIt I got busy doing other stories but what they had done as they they had carved out an entire woolly mammoth a carcass if you will but pretty well preserved because it was any ice and\nThey were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryer and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe're drawing a traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were to find the natural order of thing and he kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I\nIt was very mired in for a merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for us right now but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion\nAccording to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we do that if we take it on or who was gonna be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back ... quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy your beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen\nRobots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he recently applied to the our son was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence [noise]\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that they you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah you know ... you write\nAn artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once boasted about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... buttoned up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is let's use in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly the magic\nSo after I liked that the cushy ... ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how is raising was at the right now I fully believe that completely senator and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendship [noise]\nI think our

I Know several people who have a ... who has a\nTrouble walking or the last ... you'd walk and they've been spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream ... do you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that er yeah that that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement are called the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd uh now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial\nArms you know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his thought so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I was amazed fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even and um [noise] even in the military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robo cop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free\nIs that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but [laughter] and\nIt never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing that sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I quote him in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon uh using neural net says it's just a fancy way of saying these are\nRobot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words to give them\nComplete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race so right\nYeah ... it in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nYeah all that technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same you know all our faults and our ... our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor conundrum not the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ... you know I mean\nThat's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for him and there were some terminal but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going [noise] uh and his weaknesses\nBut but positive for sitting because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end in how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nUh by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nWere not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into [noise]\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how they came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch [noise]\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it Michael Gillett next on the coast to coast am in for George ...\n[noise] radio\nOff News I'm Carmen Roberts the red Sox

for\nA little less frightened on coast to coast am this is Ian punted [noise]\nJulie Leslie seal oath to Howard group Oscar with my fourth and our email for director of operation\nWhere it was overwhelming running again today and being yellow with scientists and the job on the end\nIt wasn't about that but what really connected with me what how passionate about something logical this operation we starting to get the next town that led to process plan databases child development when he became a geek I ... I knew we had to hire him [noise]\nI don't know how we would have found out there without Lincoln job to find\nYour next tier with Lincoln jobs you reach people you won't find anywhere else we look beyond job title to learn how you're looking for and then we match people with the right skills and experience to your role I thought we were looking for a ... operation that we were really looking for an Oscar\nStart hiring with Lincoln jobs today go to link dot com slash working again fifty dollars off your first job at ... dot com slash working for your fifty dollars off terms and conditions by\nWhat happened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems like you're constantly getting up to ... and you're even getting up at night to go this is not okay listen\nThe makers of super beta prostate the number one prostate formula are introducing a new wonder pill super beta prostate piece three advanced with three key ingredients that are great for your prostate if like taking three prostate supplements and want to celebrate we're sending free bottles to men who want to cut down on bathroom trips\nYes your first thirty days supply is free\nPay shipping and handling just dial pounded two fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle early research suggests that an ingredient in P. three advanced may help support an normal prostate sauce combine that with a production and urges to pay and you have a formula you'd be crazy not to try try ... free\nDial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle again dial pound to five zero I see the key word free bottle\nSix hundred go go [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh Michael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the least looked into it and his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found with a woman was wearing these woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so\nThey downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it's like no they weren't [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm focused on myself but anyway [laughter] and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the\nEnd of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug up [laughter] and now they're I think the question you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is work out a upon and find it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that ah that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a medical experiment that people talk about a lot ... ... we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn\n... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that's kinda running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the horror from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on ... you know getting I think you can and some coffee [noise] yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a kid more elite dishwasher six so they're not exactly accurate those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say it's really interesting about\nThe Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in mind let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast saying David\nDoing hey my question for a minute or so ago and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah and then or if they do we just leave them and we just lost [laughter]\nOh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI uh enjoy your show but uh I've been on any kicking machine going on forty five years yesterday I Know a bank or do generation had like you know from your guest are winning pills or the shoe will\nBe overcome through CRISPR or a maybe a ... either by pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nHang hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe's on dialysis is on ... ...\nLike my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight if they'll not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're\nMaking enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that\nIs already working on a second generation a that will help actually restore\nSight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nBut that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your choice will spirit and looking forward to

Hope you went to coast to coast am dot com and watched this video of the Oregon pot shop and the moving jar if you didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nDowntown Oregon City era our parents at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero trees a can of his dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy Gomez next to it\nAs it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing there like somebody that's like right here\nSuddenly the jar bombs on the level surface that just happened then Andy remembered the surveillance camera with others I\nNot long after that this happened watched the Penn it's completely skill and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... certified video GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with you as a farm\nIn ... to ... and so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there is no real explanation for why there are there\nBut that video ... especially in the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it as you want to jump in on open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours\n[laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run the animal and children\n[laughter] yes well I Am right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's not going to be a good to be in the Eighteenth

I I'm with you in your it I mean within ... in a\nRow the Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that so peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say then it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were\n... I wouldn't have to have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we get a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I'm In a world power guys first of all for not in her five years I don't want to get through my interest right\nI'm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this in March ... her I'm a reader either in a manner or would it have anything to eat ... that were to survive\nI mean we even know what to do and that says firemen now and furthermore it\nOur current situation right now we have there are a lot of people to sign up for survival situations and there are a really great pressure the Mormon too are you know highly come I Will surprise for\nFor years to come for for them is families with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not we\nAre usable wrong and we don't know even with\nTraining we do know is the supplies what's known somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean\nSo I Would hurt on your way to um foreign scare myself not to\nUh consumed companies suppliers but just chew on my cell and my child you then I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to\nGive her trial like for a year on one at the supplies without training without any knowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nSay and then sell an interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho haven't had any training on how to year the supplies that are stored up with ... or or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I ...

Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and\nPlay you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it you know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the sciences there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... but I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear\nFor somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook\nBasically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what\nI ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is the artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[laughter] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the

instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nThey were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of uh trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen\nAre preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church so um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true\nBut then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nThat is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're ... traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow where to find the natural order of thing and it kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for us right [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the de ... thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen\nRobots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about\nThis guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence [noise]\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look\nInto what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on it it it is inevitable that one day a artificial\nIntelligence robot Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah you know ... you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just\nComputations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at\nAbout well you know like you they're ... button it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small but you know\nOne day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know\nTen thousand two hundred and twenty five so [noise] yeah and it\nAnd I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average IQ using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nSo after I liked that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose\nA yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers\nNow how is raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely Senate and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm

I Know several people who have a ... who has\nA trouble walking or the lost their ability to walk and they've been spinal injuries and and that this to them is a dream ... do you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah the the discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's there's actually\nA movement called the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that the usable a trends human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms to the vet them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we're mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his car so they're they're wired his\nMind and I ... a fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and maybe even end um [noise] even\nIn the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there you know where you know write it get it ... it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own yell at them but I think that the\nI think it would be a threat to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robo cop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free\nIs that I think that that I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\nAnd ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter]\nYeah I Know and and now and and the coalition a group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon uh using neural net is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes\nDo you get such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nSo right yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know\nYeah all that technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we had our just still the same you know so oh our faults and our ... our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum not the Terminator conundrum but this\nConnor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over well by the technology\nOf the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism\n... you know I mean that that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those\nHalloween he kind of moments right there were like All right no there is this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMay be there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the little theory whenever there and they monitor that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships a prior communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so I think that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities that something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nBigger videos that kind of a ... year treasury rate or your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than eight million\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show the thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and the police started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it Michael Guillen next uh coast to coast am in for George ...\n[noise] [noise]\n... introducing new Medicaid plans in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's still family care dot com colleague three three four six seven eight to five nights for Medicaid plans from up to my health\nNews ...
