I'm a while it was still classified uh\nHe uh is making claims that he oh ran the project that he started the project that it was you know that he brief the president and and I mean these are laughable thing as a\nDid not happen you're saying not true or not true All right uh\nI'd like to make a comment here as well uh this is Joe ... is also made claims that I've worked for him and uh that sort of thing and those are in fact we not true statements\nYeah he said I worked for him to and I didn't [laughter]\nAll right here's a fax a Mr mcgonigle ... has has said that ... or ... was never a remote viewer ah with the government but was simply a person who was employed interview prospective candidates for the government remote viewing program could you please ask him to comment on that\nUm there's ... ... let me jump in the halls around this is Paul okay well that's actually not completely correct to in the snow was part of the Jews because they didn't overlap had came in on the scene a long after Joe was\nGone um\nIt actually did indeed do did participate in some operational won't be doing projects however that wasn't his primary function or he was indeed a a\nA more an analyst the task or a managing training and stuff you know he did he he he was kind of a Jack of all trades in that regard you wasn't hired primarily as a rule you were in only under exceptional circumstances that you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational during I got that he did one ... oh no you argue that you crisis on ... on for a number or I haven't gone through the list but uh I'd say uh I saw at least six or seven that he was a list of the Iran all I really\nI didn't have that and I didn't remember that from my data base uh this is\nJoe I'd like to comment on my comment [laughter] ah that's not an exact quote for what I said All right um the claim was made\nA um buy at\nA dams that that he was the only person who who was qualified the trainer or teacher of the people remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote viewer in up in the project and the only one who was\nA responsible your and my comment was that his primary job while he was with the unit was to\nTo act as a monitor and interface with the viewer in terms of a\nFan linger setting up remote feelings and that he was not a primary trainer he may have trained or in the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing\nAnd that's OK that everybody had specific jobs on the Internet um and every one performed as they were required and I suspect that he perform\nYou know righteously and do the job or very well [laughter] ah or I have a problem is where he makes claims then then attributes them to himself when they're in fact don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with this any more to that\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you not referred to as deems as Dr Doom [noise]\nAh this was a nickname that was given to him and the unit before he came to us or he was a he was called Dr Doom over there ah he's been predicting doom death and destruction for years and years and years now\n[laughter] or would you say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen\nBut that would be a perception this was a\n... and that's fine I'm ... one of the remarkable things about remote doing is that when you when you make a prediction or you make a statement about something a one would hope that there would be some validity or some method by which you could prove whether you're the veracity of the information or I could\nCertainly choose or pick targets that are completely under viable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a opening yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense that danger\nUm he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so called [laughter] yeah um and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out he accepts a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more\nSitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic abilities\nAnd deems has said I accept I called the amazing Randy so called and asked him to come\nAnd he settled socks and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell add to come up with these numbers I said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that oh so how about coming on the program in setting up\nA structured test uh with the controls set up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program I'm do any of you feel\nThat the amazing Randy's challenge could be a taken and met\nA as it stands a he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind\nUh and if you if anyone does things on his terms oh he wins I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate or\nDoing it on his terms you'd you'd\nYou'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick a\nYou know that he uses for\nFor his own a popularity and so forth\nOK buddy that yes but if if the controls were set up a independently uh from Mr Randy\nThen he wouldn't participate\nAnd so that's why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about that he he doesn't accept the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs in the world\nThat's what I was asking more about what might have been actually remote viewed or what you might have sensed\nA let me jump in here if I might oh it was some time last year that uh the prediction was made about the frogs mutating and so forth is\nHowever a I have right here on the computer a copy of New York times from may\nA march of Nineteen Ninety four talking about a frog mutations and another one the Associated Press on Ninety five talking about it [noise] well uh you know\nI can remote do things that have already happened anybody can do that or that's easy\n[laughter] oh right oh\nCan you know it's easy to predict things that have already happened oh\nAll right let me let me pull away from this are you guys are going to have ... have already having too much fun with this [laughter] um let's talk about parents for a second one obvious target in the past of immense interest to people worldwide\nIs whether there was really a man who walked the earth\nWho was the son of God called Christ\nOh it must have been a for you at some time and in evidently tempting target [noise]\nUm this is Lynn oh I had done a series of ah of decisions on oh

V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows but also um\nI was down in Atlanta one time a working with a student and I had the chance to meet a person named uh Courtney Brad ... who was going to put out a book\nOr this book was about the Stargate project and he asked me to take a a\nCopy of the manuscript that he had and read it and then the first chapter of the manuscript never remember everything was still classified highly classified I'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nOh I went back and I said I said Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh and uh you know if you do they'll they'll confiscate your book or something in in any way that got him to take that first chapter out mhm oh I ask him where did you get this information and he said well I got it from it\nOh\nWhen I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst\nTrees and that any agent could ever do\nWas give the names of the other agents or I mean you you you fight the cyanide pill and die before you do that and yet here is the entire list uh\nFor the purpose of being published while this was still a a a classified thing now the reason that upset me so much was because um of another incident where it at a meeting\nHad gotten up and told what I had done a\nAgainst Hussein and er I called him on the phone and I said to add\nThese are crazy people with guns and uh I've got a family here and he just blew it off well the only purpose I could find for giving those names to coordinate the publishing the book while it was still classified\nOh deals with the idea of targeting for remote viewing\nOr if you have a name basically you have an address and a the a history of Russian\nBlood is go to Robin Vancouver\nWouldn't want to say is for all this craziness going on in there I feel like you are a lot of sorrow\nOf actual journalism where you are ... and there's nothing else or like we're going to be going through some incredible time [noise]\nNot only going to be good to Rocky's a machine we're going to get to what you need\nYou were listening to our bill somewhere inside tonight between coast to coast am from march twenty Nineteen Ninety seven\n\nFor all three of you are in the process of learning or are in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm I don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced myself or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous I Know there are claims out there to the contrary but uh\nUm you know I I just don't know where that is coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] ah this is Lynn could I jump in here for a second\nYes um [noise]\nFor each person when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are things that your subconscious unconscious have been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with\nA any real danger that\nComes to a person\nI think is basically caused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring the danger that is then let loose\nUm\nI have never had any are even actually known any person who has had a a\nA remote view in session where this session itself or the target itself\nA had a had a danger to the fewer oh\nI think what you carry into the learning process for remote viewing may be a danger to you but that danger has been there all along anyway I'd ... I'd like to add\nSomething to that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and uh Paula both said\nI've never had a bad experience and remote doing but I Would like to underscore the fact that uh this is a very interesting um\nExperience remote going or being psychic and or or a lot of people that are that are on the edge to start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their construct\nOr it can be very undermining or damaging to the psyche\nThe the problem has been that uh because of ethical in human years reasons uh whenever those experiments are done you have to inform the person the targeted individual that they're participating remote influencing experiment\nAnd as long as those particular rules ruining ... would be taught them out to impossible to know whether or not remote\nInfluencing it was actually taking place as a result of a unknown targeting or whether or not by virtue of fact the person knows are involved in that kind of experiment there actually willing you willingly opening themselves to being targeted\nSo it's an issue there probably won't be answered and kill someone has come about a ... an approved protocol that in part individuals without them knowing our own wedding targeting\nWell there's a lot of uh talk going on now about influencing of a different sort of by the Chinese with regard to our present administration and one would have to imagine if there is a Chinese project enters remote influencing is possible that would've been an obvious uh\nA major a project or would

associate still with the cognitive science as well that was the original abacus awry and then later as I say I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a\nUh some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research or up here and we hope to continue or pursuing the mechanisms behind remote doing\nDuring you talk about it at all I I mean I Am for example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time I'm with national security work uh uh you know Congress and oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nOr we we of course it see a sellout are the kinds of science as well have never endorsed uh espionage of any kind of were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports I function\nBut we've recently done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have\nIndicated that we may be on the something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and if those prove out which we have every reason to believe they will\nUh there'll be some very astounding a findings that will open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier selves\n[laughter] every time I'm kind of scares me a\nHigh price I Am [noise] uh no longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed by it\nI Would agree with that a state but\nIs it one of those things that once you have be gone uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was involved in the government\nTo cool said in like that so for two hundred and forty

perfect made in life and if so how would that be done\n[noise] uh the answer is yes however let me uh oh say that that type of uh work or\nIs sometimes achieved much more easily or by some other disciplines oh\nI've I've said that a remote viewing you're you're not talking about bar hopping like oh no\n[laughter] [noise] uh\nSo as far as the the disciplines prepare psychology or if you\nIf you're trying to learn remote viewing in order to get in touch with the universe or your higher so uh it's sort of like joined in the Marines to learn how to fold your clothes [laughter] oh it's a\nIt's extremely disciplined and uh they're easier and sometimes even quicker ways to ways to do it\nAll right um I don't want to tell everybody once again that are on my website W.

well here's a question from Ross in California and it's a neat one uh please ask when if he has ever targeted the period of time in which the dinosaurs roamed first\nOh not personally oh that is a I'm a fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training of\nYou know just as a as another uh\nA session to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that well\nThere was a there is the second part to the question okay or if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nOr I don't remember specifically good in that I have always felt that oh a form of a man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from remote viewing I got from other studies that have done a simple archaeological bondage\nAnd then you have a good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries and um before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California by saying Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't remote Schumer say\n[laughter] but you answer the way you want when All right we have ah people working on numbers which is a very hard thing to do in remote viewing a there is another type of remote viewing\nAlternate I mean I'm I'm a A R B a alternate remote viewing\nOh which a substitute ... remote viewing targets for the numbers and ah allows you to a remote view a trench this depict three no the way the ... normally done is if you are doing the pick three\nYou have a four people working at a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view one of the numbers and one person who clicks the data looks on the church to see what the ...\nThe results Maine and goes and places Tibet off um but it it it's been done and uh oh it's been done successfully\nWell do you help people like this the Lyn\nUh yes now one of the problems that I have is this a security clearance\nAnd ah for many other reasons as well or if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen I Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh\nUh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to so and so yes I'm I Will tell them\nPartially because I Want to cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity that oh if they will get the investigating officer to contact me I Will be glad to work the problem for pre\nMa'am ma'am ma'am ma'am\nMa'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case you can't have your son contact him\nThere aren't there have been living here for ...\nYears but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now\nWe worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years and uh and on the results of our ah\nOur session Mel Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding are I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can\nI get a hold of lame\nOkay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nOr do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume if she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest to address to remember is art bell dot com and ah right there's a link to my page and on my pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with the computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time we are heavily backed up with a signed witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so um oh\nI Hope people won't be offended if um you know if they call and uh have their police department call as well\nAnd uh nothing is done that day\nAh we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable a west or the Rockies you're on the air with lint Buchanan good morning\nAri yes\nGood morning my credit for that kind of lost track of all\nPeople out there to cover up a fake like already back\nAlright I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate exactly\nAre absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much\nAh does a session on a target and they're wrong that\nOut of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm a\nTask the same exact question to two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to it deems a tapes which generally\nThe group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works if it works then I'm all for it but then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop that's\nMy fear I Do believe very strongly in the show Drake effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote view correctly the more who learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn encourage\nExcuse me incorrectly ... and uh this is my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there oh that I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder lake effect just a you know the hundredth monkey a Fisher a just a\nAlmost destroy any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYoung well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released it a very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen we're coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a one of the sun has to be back there huh\nYes uh looking out the window it is uh-huh [laughter]\nAll right my friend while I suspect you're going to have a lot of emails to answer and this will keep you busy for a while it has been a distinct pleasure Lynn and we will do it again one day of her eyes for it\nI really enjoyed it uh I don't get the art bell show because I live in a very steep little valley and our local radio station as the water's edge of

enjoy it so much so\nI enjoy all this stuff and I like what I like to do is I like to learn about all of them and try to put the pieces of the puzzle together and there's a lot of you out there like that too now there's a lot of you that just you want to stick to go ... you want to stick to a\nUm ...\nViewing you want to stick to UFOs you want to stick to the abductee the you know higher consciousness whatever that's great we need you guys to get into a deeper and deeper and deeper and B that expert for us to talk to you and learn from\nBut then you know there's people like me that want to learn it all get in as deep as you can on each one of them and try to pull the pieces of the puzzle together because they are connected in some way we all believe and our guests and our first guest tonight excuse me even our second guest tonight\nIs the same way so this is gonna be a fun night part of a wheel a swing and a ... maybe we'll learn some things tonight as we go so our first guest here never been on pills before\nBenjamin a Radford calling been or at least I'm going to Colombian he signs of emails Ben or one of the world's few science based paranormal investigators he's done a firsthand research into all the different phenomenon and this is cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well we'll have to ask them about that but he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA study in this kind of stuff psychics ghost haunted houses ... miracles that that's you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about his miracles but also Bigfoot lake monsters and you know Loch Ness things like that UFOs reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is known for solving the mysteries of the Santa Fe court house goes into thousand seven\nUh also will have to ask them about the cheap cheap a cobra\nAnd twenty can he he knows a whole lot about creepy clown she calls them bad clowns I'll call them creepy clouds they are bad clowns and he's the first the bull so fully examined\nThe evil clown phenomenon and I was going to talk about that tonight within the there's so much to talk about with him but I think I Want to say that for something else or another day 'cause you can actually talk about creepy clowns and bad clowns ... three hundred sixty five days out of the year right\nSo uh we're going to get some are going to get we're we're going to learn about the origins of Halloween and uh it it's just really cool to meet him\nBecause he'd been all over and you know he's been all over television as well and he does like to keep it science may so let's bring him on here for the first time ever and coast to coast welcome Dan to coast to coast damn how are you\nI'm doing well thanks for having me I I Love will is we need to trademark that that's great\nI Know right and she went over there and check out the domain hurry up get it for me please [laughter] somebody's got snagged that right all of it\nThat's fun stuff so you're very similar to me he got deal TV background and the passion to know the truth and to study everything and try to pull it all together so when I\nYou know found you know I was like oh my gosh he's like he's like this is great so now have you been able to go all across the planet I mean you've been everywhere this this is this is good\n[noise] well there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there's a lot of money in\nThe rain and crow by some sort of X. files department but I'm not simply\nYou know I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir and do things like that but I'm but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly to answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking the ghosts again all\nRight you know it's like they're like we're going to be the Gore going to go to the beach and like that's really cool idea there is a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and\nSo that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happened to be there any way and so I turned into investigation one I can\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] so I Do it and do it at midnight\nRight All right that's right will swing ... [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you\nKnow 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween you know saint saint saint ... and and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool jak lantern that you get to make I think of all whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins and\nAnd they're very fun fun things that's

really does have an interesting history very rich in history\nUm it's silly it's scary and ... get St panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the ah television shows around that kind of Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like it sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of\nI'm suddenly the guy that talks about that but a lotta times ah there you know there there's a lot of them are just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself oh and we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\nYeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive of like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies\nAnd it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Want to offer but\nI wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go x-ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist off an X ray the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look to the candy make sure that Kay but he did it yes so that you can feel the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however ... was it primarily for money isn't always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily restrict or the British Isles\nAh and then it came over with the with the first and second we use of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the with Charles ... have you know when they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination [noise]\nUm and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy though\nRight you'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ... and what you find is that\nThe the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and you know plastic molded and stuff but what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise\nAnd you know it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this was when you started getting adults who were you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the\nDrag yeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know there's something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um so you know you talk about the history\nNow that we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell on a good question you know I think that um you know\n... mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each\n[noise]\n\nGotta ... ... ... ... in the house\nDavid your guy that has overcome a severe issue\nOr what a light the light bulb went on and I started to research on the same reasons why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better I can only tell you one thing the product war\nAnd not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy gives me right charity care or health system better way carnivores build everything back into my body [noise] taken a while but you know ... camps and all\nThis is Richard Haass throw owner for carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight seven six eight seven three five\nOr who's a carnival or a dot com C.

oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating\nUm goes goes hunting stuff so let's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of ghost tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talked about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know\nAnd the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and said panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in from you know a mall haunted house you know reach out and grab the crow somebody or whatever and it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean a a mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... from the conservative cause damage because of its roots with with with taking ritual\nBut you know the the ancient the health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if you drink when if you ask them you know if you told them about from from goat creature that you know the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about one or the world view\nAnd and again you know before when festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's but there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to a team you know do\nNot suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this is fine uh this is of course not just showing that that's one of the more\nObviously comes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighty with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm In rural playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a way to go to ... in a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there doing investigation and looking to go and\nAnd on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it if it weren't you born or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know do you want to point or whatever\nI I agree with that one\nBut I think what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the room you find this don't use it and so\nYou know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because\nIn a van mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know\nAdults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was that a kid the dresses up as a witch or goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\nParents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything but I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know\nBlack lights and the ah we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations that ... W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers we take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas and just the way it was right down the\nMarathon bars on either right away I Am doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great under you're just taking you back or love is\nSomebody needs to a grad that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back\nOh man I I mean anything to go after we're done here and uh\nAnd uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was lost USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that cell or hey you guys are going on there now so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at it at ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims there that you you ... the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are\nEasy to investigate those particular claims and and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part part part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into location maybe there's a team of them\nAnd they'll they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else they'll go home and analyze them the problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's\nWhat's what's um paranormal or abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever reading as you get\nYour walking around with the M.

six hundred go go [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's coast to coast am kind of you will is here will is a wean is what's\nIf you if there's a mysterious sounding voice or something coming from somewhere then that means that by definition their their material because we you know\nSound is Adia waves and and you know ... you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing audio waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on you know audio tape and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost\nFor the most part they are ones that the replicate what we can experience right we were well we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them [noise]\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... filled with actors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS\nUm there's there's theories and there is speculation but but no one has ever proved that you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or\nA who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nOr in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome and if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time saying I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but what what what what is it\nWell you know I'm I don't know what goes sir I mean that that you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the ghost hundreds and believers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there's something that's going on and\nThen you know with some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and trees that is the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spears the debt that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for goes research right because\nGoes can't be both inner dimensional spirits and you know an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena that has such a widely disparate range of explanations that's a problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that\nThat my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spears of the day that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nFor windows for Willis we thank you for getting the information you had in fact that I Know you have a whole lot\nOr that we can go to but are coming up so we're going to be talking they wear wolf's in London so you don't want to stick

you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um\nAn interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time of Halloween or that were the fun was a little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of\nHonestly because I follow these things every Halloween about those and of course the scary clown scary clown panics 'cause I\nI'm suddenly the guy that talks about that but a lot of times ah there you know there there's a lot of them are just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago and he went to the the um the police saying that\nThe ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\nYeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Would ever but\nI wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray or candy I mean really do you\nDo people really go to the emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to ... ... is that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dance often\nAre actually the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything and the candy and the answer was almost all you know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you know yeah [laughter] I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy and if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so they can feel the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics hear what you know we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know predatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know and sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts or the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nI'm ... and in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the the trials be have clean they were they were dead set against Callaway and that was that was an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly ... for for for many years I'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirits store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know point\nThough you'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a gift costume and what you find is that\nThe first um the ... the first record that I found up Halloween masks are really emerging in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know or need the classic molded and stuff but what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise\nAnd you know it's it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the the sexy police officer to measure the\nDrag yeah and of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have\nA you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know there's something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well on us no good question you know I think that um you know when I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed I mean we've\nWe've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit um and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's\nKnown as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like\nScary scary stuff going on [noise] um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there is asserting innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed\nHum what is like a dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid just eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a go you know where you've\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that because if you had that in his late this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about their say panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm kinda Willis and this is really sweet tonight\nNever missed a detail or short just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ...\n\nQuestions teeny the flexibility to take classes and your schedule you have college credit to transfer\nDo you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned you know the one line except most transfer credit for information talks before you get three five five one setting learned for yourself like oh here was ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report\nAnd learn to drive with Arizona State university for more information about on the one line talks you kept three five five one setting off year had three five five ... or\nYou one of Seventy percent now Seventy percent of you will make mistakes he thinks\nHe's ... and why I say go live\n\nA tremendous victory I'm Pam who sales Fox News that President Trump just got confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\n[noise]\nIf you need anything from a civil home repairs to a major remodel you need to know about home advisor it's a totally free service that instantly connected with top local service froze\nAdvisor is very easy way on her own contractor and for me it's the only way\nYou can you have either for everything your house cleaning your paintings electricians plumbers handyman we've had nothing\nEvery single time just elected type of work you need done and home advisors profiling\nThe technology instantly fines pros in your area you can read customer reviews of the pros\nEven use their ... guide to find out what hundreds of other repairing improvement project costs in your area I think everybody can you tell everybody how their advisors they total solution to any type of work you would ever want to do around your house and best of all it's completely free\nHow my by their dot com or download free I\nGotta feeling ... to ... in the house\nDavid your guy that has overcome a severe issue\nOr whether light the light bulb went on and I started to research on the same ...

the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating\nUm goes goes hunting stuff so let's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGhost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about\nThat let's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil\nWith some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted house you know reached out and grab the crow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that's it for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean I I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause panic because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient the health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if you during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was before I went festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene\nAnd all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's but there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is twenty two Eighteen you know ... not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously\nComes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there doing investigation and looking to go and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it if it ah where'd you born or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners\nWere so concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nWill know but it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the room you know sign this don't use it and so\nYou know typically the concern\nIs uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... motion that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or a goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um\nKnow everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything but I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights in the uh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or\nIt was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas and just the way it was right down the\nMarathon borrowing mine either right away I Am doing those\n[laughter] he'd freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great under you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nThey were and they came in\nIt was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ... around the back oh man I I mean anything Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last seen McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah yeah yeah yeah never on all the producers were were watching that cell or say hey you guys are going on there now so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the same kind of part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they doing to cemeteries are they going to the woods or they go into you know the um\nAnything we're all look at this at ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original quake there you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are\nEasy to investigate those particular claims and and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of the investigating and you get the get the cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that if it if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample look so for example you'll see undergoing location they because team of him\nAnd bill you know they'll take readings for three hours or sick or whatever else they'll go home and analyze them the problem is that not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's\nWhat's what's um paranormal wrapped around we need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with him after character magnetometer

M. F. um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or\nA who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nIn ghost hunting and that is one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome and if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see a good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we could talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why what what is it\nWell you know I'm I don't know go for I mean that that you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the grossed hundreds unbelievers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on and\nThen you know with some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and treat the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit of the debt that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions\nIs problematic for goes research right because\nGoes can't be both inner dimensional spirits and you know an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena that has such a widely disparate range of explanations that's a problem so I I don't know what ghosts\nAre obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there for ... years of the day that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nThe good stuff for widows for Willis wean thank you for hitting these information you had in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can get a cue but are coming up so we're going to be talking they wear will in London so you'll want to stick around in Jamin 'cause all Sinclair\nHe somebody you want to me out in the case in time\nDefinitely thank you yeah yeah I Will tell us where we can find you and I get more information\n[noise] yeah or you can find me I'm On Facebook or been Richard ...

[noise]\nTelling the truth I mean if you like a refuge was built on it and the ... century that took place called spiritual Kona inflicts than it was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that poll made up\nIn the king was ... he ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge the night it's a fabulous name was called a home so he built his refuge to protect Trump travel is from an infestation of salvage base\nThat's interesting\nYeah it's probably with some stuff with a name spittle hospital comes from\nIt was built to that's why they call it spits O'Connor or at least they be devoured I I was lucky enough to contact the people in our own with what is now the ... in a after they've been stopped face to being a refugee hundreds of years ago because they supposed to nine\nFifty seven refuge was built so we're going back a long way obviously not far back as the early settlers of stock or\nA bill ...\nBut he was due to protect travelers from an infestation of Savage beast\nLeast they be devoured it said now I look to that dates and the ... some of the days of them ...\nAnd that's what it says under is documentation on the line that you'll find that says this we we must also not forget Tony that you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent in the u._k. and bad so\nYou know that we don't necessarily to an entirely talking about too where will this these stories that are quite incredible because when you look at the ... you then you go into the research you discovered the flakes than was once called ...\nWhich is interesting and I it's now ... old ... on old maps those areas of flexed and they pick to this will fund\nAnd just a few ... as soon as somebody changed the name\n... to make it like like maybe the scene safer\nSomething or they didn't want people to think of the old miss maybe or you know why would someone changed the name I mean that's like ooh there's a reason why that\nYeah well there's a reason and we'd go connotations to the world for you know in any case it is true with proper research that can be sort of ... took if anyone else wanted to look into it\nYou know there's a there's a small village just a few miles away called home the mountains there and if you break down the name\nAnd then go back in history and looks will do some sort of research and housing hound mom they ... they used to be called farms that of the hound mom all\nThese sorts of incredible connections to the wolf and to the dog there was a an hour that stood on some old maps called bomb dog house we realized once again that this does not throw as\nInto the realms of the way I Will vote then when I started collecting these stories when I went and spoke to first hand witnesses going back to the Nineteen forties I mean one of these guys are still it's still alive and\nWell can I think we were pushed probably just jump into this and stop telling some of the stories of\nThe phone to literally I'm listening to ya I'm enjoying myself Willis wean\nI'm In the dark delight you're damn man\nI'm listening to these nice little stories getting me into the Louis we know now I think in a way I'm I'm very interested in hearing about the where will not only do I want to hear about the end but let me know abusing guinea this do with what we also call Don man\nThis is a good point so before we start like yeah I I think that they probably is\nConnected to what you call dog mountain which ... which I Would face a relatively new to him and where will well is it interesting to ... we always up the ridicule ... a field because people you're obviously\nWe haven't been cut off because I don't smoke on on my phone but that's cool um [laughter] it was over so jumping about no Nineteen forty eight but a series of burial mountains or the ... and ... well gold shop how is the name how means burial mount ...
