lose in court and there's no way to win is there\nJust enough to cover the costs of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from Alan Paulos before these loans\nWell the money is used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans uh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out\nA and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the tax payer and they keep it for themselves [laughter]\nAh but um so yeah this was a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a ... something that makes this\nA predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter]\nThere are also fair debt collection practice laws\nFederal um a fruit in lending laws [noise] ah and these again are restricted or it's completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis\nOf this genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] ah like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who whose child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy\nThousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you now you're per year\nThat's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad is now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending\nProgram standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond in shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how this student loan problem is\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nNo universal access at ... ... us ... access for over Twenty years [noise]\nUnwritten go go go go dot com [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it ... that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three reason engineering and hum I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty\nPercent of everybody out there was too long as it's falling into\nA is a lending system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on\nSixty minutes a and this was a peace with the Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean you've got these payday loan center outrageous and predatory are that are geared marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy\nAre these um secondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's got great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no brakes any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership here at like hey guys you know the car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans in particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night uh expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the ... and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy what's what's the tuition like can't Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four years I\nShould have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price\nEven at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not this is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge good thank you [noise]\nI got good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a sign they throw support sealed and he left right after the whole ...\n[laughter]\nBut uh anyway I I I Want to drive a little bit of traits will do a ... a former company I used to work or I got on egg wildly when a company went under the owners of the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago about seven years now\nYou know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went on during the late everybody off\nAnd that was one of those people too so I helped her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying to them they would do well and I think ... years you know\nYou probably in Lawrence you may have more experience than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go for oh I I think it was a two month course just don't think well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going ... miles in dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive in I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I thought it was not up for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think of trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this lanes of some stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program and the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Allen he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook on it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt as college dead\nWell interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little playing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed\nThe federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit a inspiration they just send all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\n... we're going to come back and take final culture

George it's pleasure to speak with you on your\nWay I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nHuh that job thank you\nAnd I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point\nThough I'm a very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold\nThe same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information as a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listening a breakdown of all of the costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the deal he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also of the\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight uh and first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than helping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy rage back so that they can\nFuel from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies I'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nI mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a close up you know like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information al unlucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public jak clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nThat my friend that had alone with the company that went bankrupt\nNever heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nMy leaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have a ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nProblem [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon whole war what's that all about\nTo find out where George

and leave and taking\nYour credit gram but she can take your life that story and and really to\nTry in one human tree detail as as fast as I can be an entire story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with this phenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that they have been the biggest single\nWherever they are in the UFO community I think that the only story that I think comes twice and I would say this is the kind of suffocation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation\nThat off two decades to know the U.S government did have a new effort right Graham often when it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm ... and feel that the day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project we close down we haven't been doing this with knowing ... there were no investigations\nAnd of course they were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens and again to try to train on angle the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid come along and you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nThink the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail\nBecause I think the problem with the story\nIn one sense for years people have said the problem is that particularly with the ... we have two little information about what's going on\nWith the eight story with with these revelations we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's just about a case for the deep specialists or if it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing man if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen their their landmark story on this on\nThe sixteenth floor chair and then the the three videos came out to for than a than a third one but now the public have been absolutely compounded thinking yeah well this video and then there's this guy and then this millionaire businessman\nAnd and the struggling to see how it all fits together for that\nWhat I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in the course tonight Pentagon tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seeds and and you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you said in the ... said\nA direct tucked kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and onto the questions I when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I go edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did decide teamed up with Warren ... oil from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... the thing so scripted the entire movie ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think the laws\nScript for this and and so in that way\nI have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow\nDidn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it\nFrom from start to finish and that's a departure from a dates a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um\nYou know I I was a departure from me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the\nConfusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has\nIs it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and ... and ... it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go on to all the platforms that the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so that the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but too young to get people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I Do ... ah you know in some ways the story I think has poked down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon don't want to reignite the S. and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization I'm E. E. T. I. E. oh right yes I Am\nWell that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of that\nThe U.S government has said they'd always says in the soil situation's only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course\nSay yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now are the people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nUm say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's paying one arguably fringe belief for another\nSo really these ... these people and skeptics told they would believe those but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can show up dates with other coups wins would you do in the ...

should have a space for us but I think\nSome of some of the Komen trip out this has been a little far fetched I mean it'd be something from assigned fi movie finally aliens I mean it's it's more about DOMA Nineteen future idle space\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to give the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien ah intervention yes\nAnd he certainly made of course those remarks are very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly we we would set aside our differences down here on uh if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read by the law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to ...\nWhen the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much play\nOh that's right absolutely there's been there's still talk of disclosure\n... are you you know I I'm\nArguing Steven bass and all the time Nick I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects do you think the the things that are happening now our governmental ways of trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen

bringing them in yeah\nI'm ... and we've discussed this before one of the big problem of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial bought a if it turns out that we've known about this was Seventy years they can be awful lot of questions\nTo answer about that no I think it's more like clay and I don't believe either this is a kind of funny young and a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about eight tip them through the classification and release of the British Government files we are seeing government say effectively well here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can really\nYou know without compromising classified information I'm ... and ... and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely government don't really know what they're

I think people so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that psychic work with the ministry you did\nYeah I absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for any thing\nWe saw that any in any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know locate\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques by some ... that sort of thing\nSo we looked this is a classic low probability high impact scenario probably one ... but if it does the payoff is so big wine on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about ...\nSon street can dog ate the ministry of defense go into this briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd did a study which which was classified I think the ... it's now classified and only ministry defense website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it said that it it wasn't a very good study I have to say\nIt um didn't live in the last ... some of the U.

back into these talks of congressional hearings\nDid you think could happen it could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nSong get we coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee in the house armed services committee have been looking for his ... ha it\nHave been doing and secondly I think back in ... wait until the ... question off you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of of the uh science technology and space command tea and and the space\nSubcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another point if this congressional interest which we know Israel evolves into formal congressional hearings\nThe question arises well where should those hearings be as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think he will be difficult to get it away from the military frankly it was a a military and intelligence program and I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats\nAnd capabilities subcommittee which specifically talks in its terms of reference about unconventional threats well if ever there was a ... a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's bad\nSo so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact that there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing\nMyself and I sit and they said that I'd be happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this\nFor the British Government would be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that of actually going into the fine but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know war all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nAmong us not one us oh no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster results are doing what they do to get the word on there\nI absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunate play only got the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with a million ... and again you know if you don't like the way that\nYou you off portrayed on TV sometimes when you're writing documentary well I I take the same view with nice pay profit goes and this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\nThey yeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically I'm like I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee in the house armed services\nCommittee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering live before articles I've seen about this all four of them a British not one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line oh I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course off off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we'd only write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's the online version but now I guess my my reactions should be well great like\nGets it gets the attention [laughter] absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies say Brian\nHey George morning hey good to talk to you again hey hey\nAh first of all you had that you open up a show about a special report about working class and being at home and you know I got I got I've co signed for student loan you know kind of stuff so I I gotta work\n[laughter] but anyway I make great program may great crew time of your top notch guy but a Mitt what an honor it is to talk to you my my friend or not my friend but third grade on her\nThank you Brian hey listen I my wife and I are eight namely why a lot at pretty religiously and in operation a project Blue Book they had a special report I think it was like number fourteen or something like that to come out in the fifties\nThat they they sign they did they scientifically proved the UFO didn't exist\nNow you said earlier that uh some of the believers in your new book or movie uh we're ... we're we're the people that they ran into the disc labor were people from project we book and I take my answer off the air George you do a great job keep up your\nWork thanks Bryan we'll talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about Nick the con didn't report\nYes um that that was um of course white and they regard it now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear that they wanted just to get out of the UFO business\nOr at least they want it to the public out and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the ... of project Blue Book um was was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous uh Poland a memo which which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for ... sake and on ... part of the blue book system\nSo so in other words the clue with there all along that but you ate he reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long how many years well\nMy goodness ah I guess I

Weinstein where the lord and what do you think happened\nYeah go go go wasn't going to get into the technical details of the the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half a that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty that's weird\nIt it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video streams to people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place but there are centralized system of course\nSo the fact that this was a global out it suggests that there was some kind of access related problem centrally the cause is in my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I were to YouTube dot com or you'd normally get all those little thumbnail\nIt would just get the shadows with typically appear before the video with them they'll for themselves and that would be it wouldn't actually get the video [noise]\nSo uh it's it it was interesting kind of situation

being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you

I should add so that's a ... something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter]\nThere are also fared collection practice laws federal um a truth in lending laws [noise]\nAh and these again are restricted or it's completely remove a for the case of federal student loans who came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp\nThe beltway cup ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system [noise]\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent to use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private\nYou lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices trees in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise] um so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank get any private line of credit [noise]\nUh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding cetera can keep up with their budgets um\nYou know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and\nBy the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices\nBut also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is\nExploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge a huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how this student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety billion dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back if you've got a

[noise]\nGo go [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to close to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I've three degrees in engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is ah what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got the student loan situations and one of the worst icy\nAre these um secondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that\nThat's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you bite on line and say you know look it's a great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car and you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no brakes any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know [laughter] uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the\nNumber I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four years I\nShould have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and and so it's you know\nUnless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars she's crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen I got good thank you [noise]\nThey got good news for a man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big fines they throw at least ... sealed and he looked right at the whole ... oh\n[laughter]\nBut uh anyway I drive a little bit of um\nSo we'll do a ... a quarter cup there used to work or I got on equality\nAnd when a totally one hundred the owners of the night and a private life rational mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I helped her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone you fast or as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying to them they would do well and I think well ... years and\nProbably in Lawrence you may have more experience than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go for oh I I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going out and spend thousands dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive in I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools well\nYou know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program and the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Allen he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on on its gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt as college dead\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more\nSo mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sent to the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals right probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed\nThe federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nNow and we're going to come back and
