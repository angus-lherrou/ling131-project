I'll tell you what I said about it at the time that it could have come straight out of the White House press office now\nDo you have a copy of that letter and if you do you read it to his place\nA\nOr have I caught you by surprise that\nJust a matter of reaching the cross here\nOkay well I figured somewhere you'd have that I'm I'll tell you what I'll tell you know I mean\nLet me read it I have it

that my daughter you got it yeah go\nI made mistakes from ignorance inexperience nova work\nI did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct no one in the White House to my knowledge violated any law or standard of conduct including any action in the travel often there was no intent to benefit any individual with specific group\nThe FBI lied and they report to the tea depressed is covering up the legal benefits they receive from the travel off a GOP has lied and misrepresented the knowledge and its role uncovered of prior investigation\nThe officers office plotted to have a cough incurred taking advantage of cocky and a chart the public will never believed the innocence of the Clinton and they're loyal staff\nThe wall Street Journal editorial editors live without consequences I was not meant for the job\nOr the spotlight of public life of Washington Here ruining people is considered a sport\nAnd that's it that's it\nThe part that really grabbed me was they I it just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believe the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed all up and said you know he said anytime you have a note that suddenly appear when they need to be such talk and then it seemingly benefit from ...\nIt's just the immediate cause for concern\nAnd of course here you have so many destroying the state and federal only experts bleep it the statement had been taken from other documents that he had bad maybe had Britain and other contact and had been put together\nA good word you will always try to imitate known writing\nSARS and they're trying to port well of course of course so you what\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because it's been foster apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for goodbye world\n\nAnd yet that sounded like kind of a summary note nevertheless I mean some are rising everything to this point with some something in mind without having said suicide it did sound kind of final summation of the failure or however you want to look at it\nAt the press conflict there were a number of reporters that number of TV networks I don't think the grand on any of the television network\nWell there we come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story ... been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out of their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC\nOh really yeah how could they possibly ignore evidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS could choose to ignore it or protecting it sixty minutes division\nBut what about the other is and what about the Associated Press and what about you know I mean in\nPractice the major news outlet the country and they didn't send a reporter\nThen they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a whole new story or at least the dispatch coming here Reuters did a major dispatch twice the length that they usually do on these types of stories\nAnd the a P uh editors for Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story or they save us ... paragraph literally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in in Washington\nA panel of experts to declare that the foster noted suicide the government can vote otherwise\nBlah blah blah but\nThis is now ... three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come to that you know OK\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park police totally mishandled that that nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like that or any note to one document\nTo make the certification which is exactly what park police and the FBI get\nFrom the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I love my article but you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and the former head of the question document unit the gear thank you know he wanted a minimum of ...\nWell the only they were funny but then you know the out of their own yeah\nVi crime lab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows that may be a lot of crime going on there\n[laughter] well sticking with the note for a second the declaration than it is\nOr jury he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell there's a couple of reasons why first of all the with the great quality for fishing because a note\nIs found in a briefcase with or the police said that they were suspicious of the fact that that briefcase search by empty\nThe outlook that second it um benefited or people at the White House then put the onus up proving the third ... it was on and apparently the experts at any time you have a a document question document that corn\nMutilated crumple from things build on it it is often prompted effort\nTo make it come power than difficult for sure do already\nYou have a primary face a case that the English experts at\nA physician then you look at the no\nAnd the first of all the donor you look at a you know which we have a photocopy of we had a huge blow up a write in comparing you can see that it is not a match that the way the stroke structured are done the flow the slant of the letter is not the same\nSo then from a clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nWell it is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up one at certain letters like when you write a letter let's say to let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top go down at the bottom you round it out\nAnd then the last stroke is going over to the letter the end of the stroke\n... born here will not do it that way he'll ride a line down they'll stop the stroke it might take the boat and let her be and start from the top of bringing around\nAnd you can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter for example um was done in three stroke structured\nUnlike off who had a very tenuous and the style of writing uh-huh what she's saying oh we had a dolphin documents that week or two from three different for a\nVery very clear\nThat we ah that that that it it is and back\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point is like you like me like anybody who's got anything to do is saying what we're saying right now but\nThis has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step and so you're asking a couple of things aren't you you want based on this report you want more coverage you want what what where\nOr do you feel that if the Associated Press picked it up properly that's word will use prominently that then the larger networks would have no choice but to follow on\nWell I think that it would have been more likely that the networks would have followed with the story there's a heard and I think the surf either presidents one of the lead news item but it's really not their job to determine what\nThe American people should or shouldn't know they should be reporting knows if a\nPractice there were three experts here that came in and gave their opinion or one of the world pre eminent handwriting experts came into this country\nKind of the doctor leave handwriting\nYeah mhm uh well actually uh he has a lot less baggage and Dr Lee [noise]\nAh [noise] frankly and he's not and I'm unlike Dr levy um he accepted he asked for no fee\nTo do this or an hour\nOh now that's interesting ah so so in other words there could be no other uh external motivation other than trying to get to the truth well\nThe funny thing is I'm Dr all to knew very little about the case I mean he's been hearing a lot about it today these quite sure about it but he looked at it just as a matter of looking at this note and comparing it to a dumping document that\nFoster is known to have written and he said that it's not a Mac\n[noise] it it was a it was a forgery and he can see how the ...\nWrote the document because the Ford you\nNever know how someone exactly right how their stroke well\nAll right hold it right there where the bottom of the hour we'll be right back with Chris Ruddy\nWill tell you how to get hold of the Associated Press\nIs premier

murder\n... whatever it is it doesn't it even or even if justice with the bird and the FBI didn't use their proper procedures and investigating myth park belief used an examiner to certify the

this is consistent the fact that they had no fingerprint for no late impression bumped needs papers is consistent with the person who tore it having on gloved\n[noise] [laughter] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic stories so the Associated Press now you've you've me what you can I knew this is touchy territory Chris letter\nWhile the eight paint today promised a number of people that call on the media world here in in Washington and elsewhere that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know a short story but it would be a story\nCameras just published a story this Sunday laws and carried on the a P I Wonder why about a witness that was in Fort Marcy on the night foster died he came in he was the first one to spot forced his car\nAnd he told the FBI and the park police that there was a Hispanic man sitting next to post his car watching it a menacing him with very menacing looks followed him in the urine edited the park\nAnd the south I'm witness left immediately um the park police never went and visited him to interview him they spelled his name wrong in the police report\nOr when the FBI visited with him the FBI said well who wants to this man they gave you manage thing look at the Mexican American man\nAnd the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify would be unable to identify on the line up or a composite sketch this man what well\nThere it is and the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch all the man he saw the park the FBI out and out lie in their report\nNow this would maybe be a mistake if it happened one when we have so many instances in this case\nYou know there were two witnesses later in the park it sought to man and then around forced his car they sat in on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to but the whole it up just before the body was fat\nAlright look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and ah you're beginning to now camp you know even in other words if the worst case scenario is true\nAh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgery saying then you're tampering with forces that have already\nGone an awful long way here in and have a ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter\nI'm I'm not convinced that you're safe\nUm well you know there's there's risk involved than anything you do I've taken those risks and will continue to take those risks because this is a very important story and uh uh you know the chips will have to pull away they may they fall on me that I'll just take that\nTake that the when it comes\nYou know um I take it\nYou've given some amount of sun to this though I mean what was\nSo look if in fact ah this was a murder I Am one of the prime people behind expose again\nYeah I guess that's what I'm saying\nWell look and look what you know here Mike Wallace did this teeth and I think I said this to you on the last time you know my brother called me up afterwards he said ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never won at the big job on Wall street type\nPerson and I just watched the thing that makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah\nI took a pay cut to continue doing this story\nUm so what do you say I mean how how do you argue against that Mike Wallace knew that knew that I'd never reported that foster with left handed a first that with the Boston Globe but I was going to be held responsible for every era that any newspaper ever done in this case\nI'm only in the Cape to people out there that\nDo look into it that\nI'm On the right track and only indicates to me I'm On the right track when they have to make such a ... near when Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old at the dean of American television journalism pass to bring down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows that I'm having an impact\nWell ... if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is and I'm not making the charge\nUnimaginable that she would not have put the you know even if there'd been a car in front of her which some say there may have been\nShe would not have ... hit the gas if necessary pushing not car and her ... into the

what they take all we have so watch that's how important this is so I Wonder how you feel about that do you think this will\nPut a dent in those who would go and harassed doctors that do abortions

was very deep pockets the kind of money\nIt would take to run Powell\nIn a race\nSo I guess I'm a pragmatist you know me\nI can read the handwriting on the wall and I know that Pat Buchanan has been winning a lot of a straw polls and that kind of thing but I'm telling you know\nIt will come down to Clinton Dole and I think Powell Powell is going to run\nHow is\nFor all we don't know about and we know a little bit about him now\n[noise] he is pro choice we know that\nWhat else do we know about ... he's a strong leader\nWe know that\nHe's brilliance I think we agree on that he\nTalks about some gun control or sensible gun control laws\nI Would have to hear that defined before I Would uh be able to make a judgment there but in a number of areas he looks to be a fiscal conservative and a social middle of the rotor\nMoore a Republican or Democrat but it's getting hard to tell these days you know so if we get a Clinton dull Powell race I guess it might begin to be appropriate because I think that's what it's going to be to ask you which way you would be inclined to go\nSo why would you be inclined to go [laughter] [noise]\nI really think that's where it's going to go Congress are

Rockies you're on the air hello\nHow are mourning mourning\nA you know it it's interesting the way the press is covering this thing whether that\nFoster deal when when I was uh in the service during a a a\nBreaking up to a border gate story I was overseas Germany ... hours reading a European newspapers get more information sure that I was getting out of the magazine that I was describing to\nThere are there are certain similarities in the way the Washington Post had doggedly pursue under criticism um the story now that is what is happening here now how long is the ... been in this condition I don't know if ... is it laziness\nBack in those days I think uh you know nobody want to report on what Kennedy was doing a ... if if the guy to the the spirit of the times in those days was that we leave the president alone the dirty things about\nPresident along go our way back to or\nNot not quite true we leave the the woman ... or the bruising or the personal things yeah out but not this kind of thing\nBut over time the the scrutiny torture public official has been hell has has gotten more and more you know we we kept FDR's wheelchair out of out of uh many people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair and nowadays you know we know what kind of underwear president whereas my\nHair yeah like we're supposed to care is wrong\nBut it was interesting I used to have to give an update to my friends back in the states about what was going on with Watergate ... out because I got it out of a London paper and I got out of the uh uh English a printed a German newspaper\nI don't know what else you do this look you don't ignore it that's all you don't ignore it I I guess maybe according to a lot of reports on getting the Associated Press may have switched off their phones or they may be so overloaded that you know who knows I Hope it's true\nYeah this whole thing just thanks pretty badly and has for the whole time\nOr have had quite an air to it quite there's too many unanswered thanks you know ... to ... ah there's just I guess at the age of unanswered questions like who was a bumped on the back of Kato Swalwell will always be the unanswered question you know and who was that a life that's foster out with no blood\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and sale you know as Nixon did nobody ... nobody wants that for America nobody in their right mind could want that and I know on\nClay feet I Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy are both you know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but ... you know we as on quite a bit of tasteful as it is if it is something that needs to be dealt with it is something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nHad flown down to LA to ticket can remove the powder at least put out like that yeah so did you hear about that no that direct\nCalled toll free one eight hundred six one eight eight to five five\nAnd he's making a Disney movie\nOh well I'm sure than a lot organization being very sensitive to that sort of saying I'm there will be repercussions but I I was very interesting um but I Can't let me tell you what let me confirmed that story and I'll get it out All right\nYes All right it's a very interesting guy because Disney and the way\nI can I I I Will know what their stance would be man thank you let me please investigate that story before I ...\nA because that is a very a very very serious charge and I'm not down in your word or but should you be wrong about something like that there would be very serious a legal repercussions\nSo let me find out about that\n\nBut even if true uh it is it is certainly an isolated incident I'm not significant compared to what Chris Ruddy seems to have come up with here\n\nYou know Charlie's reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's going to be typical of the liberals\nAnd I guess there is going to be no way no escape from the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nSimply going after this president and maybe it is that the midget liberal mind the myopic mind to the average liberal like Charlie cannot react in any other way even too serious\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk it away by saying that it's I'm a conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals a great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised [noise] first time caller line you're on the air\nI fellow\nThat I can barely hear you you're gonna have to get into the phone and shout out is\nOh okay I'm In here and yes ma'am\nAnd that last night or someone Carter was that the um hay on Bob\n... comment yes right and they had a piece that allow it did yes\nAh\nI don't think you mentioned that last night with Judith uh\nNo idea I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight but that you had asked well we get a warning\nI did well well I mean in in sort of a general way I have yeah sure if a comet were to hit earth would we know about it yeah\nWell I'm On a April twenty third on your program had playing one town\nYes and half a topic with Catholic\nProfit yes correct\nAnd he said that the boy the end though warning would be great act of mercy and now by car would appear and the guy that might have wrote them\nWell All right thank you it may be ma'am it may be and uh there was interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the a piece that broke off which by the way is not\nIn the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a spiral\nUm and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comment or somebody worried [laughter]\nIt is a piece that simply is wrists\nSaying the minister Louis Farrakhan leader the million Man March in Washington DC told a stunned crowd at a Washington Baptist church the march was inspired by an extra terrestrial vision he had ten years ago\nA UFO he said swept him off to a space ship where the late ... larger Mohammed told him the president Ronald Reagan was plotting a war\nFarrah Khan was then beamed back to earth you said quote I really don't care if you think I'm nuts and quote he told the church without elaborating on how his vision was connected to the march\nWow [noise]\nWell maybe I'd been pursuing Louis Farrakhan as a guest in the wrong way and maybe he would respond to an invitation to dreamland\n[noise] [laughter] what do you think [noise] part\nThe Vince Foster situation and I think this is good advice for everybody\nHe says if the truth\nShell set us free than a lie whether blatant or a sin of omission she'll keep us bound prisoners of those who would have us in darkness and ignorance so they can continue to control\nThe Vince Foster scandal could very well be the tip of an iceberg when further investigated could revealed to the American people that our government is built on a mountain of lies\nWhen given the truth history has demonstrated that people will rise up even in the face of the greatest adversity in danger to preserve the human spirit Republican or Democrat conservative or liberal female or male young or old\nWe deserve to be told the truth\nMost sincerely is your program appreciated by this one signed is a Dora there is a name for you in San Diego\n... that is exactly the way I feel about it I'm not afraid of the truth\nI'm just not afraid of it and I'm not afraid of where it leads and you may or may not have noticed this about me yet but I Do not respond to individual items presented to me it logically\nI just don't I respond to them I Hope I'm directly in pragmatically\nUm and examine each one for it's worse I don't in other words I don't I Do have I Am basically ... fairly moderate conservative\nBut I'm not a reactionary I look at each thing as it comes along and I'm not afraid of the truth I'm just not and if it ever gets to the point where I Am then I Need to walk away from this job and I'm not going to do that\nUntil it gets in and hopefully it never does\nI mean if I had to come on here and in effect serve my masters you know whoever they might be\nI couldn't do it\nI'll just leave it at that I you know I'll just leave it at that I couldn't do it and wouldn't do it\n\nIt's not what this job is all about at least not for me\nOkay\nEast of the Rockies you're on the air high\nArt I'm white job yet on I thought about not sixty minutes\nYou're talking about Chris Ruddy\nUnlike the bunker look I got ... ... he's got a barren out there right I mean they've got to admit it's pretty uh pretty funny\nUm I saw the peace yes and um then they not only to bump him sir but they left or the better part of him on the cutting room floor they took words out of his sentences did you know that\nOh come on and off my quality wipe 'em around part of your kidding me comes on your show is like an art bell groupie all of us thought nurse off that really ah\nAh so you think there's a panel of forensic experts best in the world in the handwriting their analysis saying it's a forgery is meaningless\nI think I think for the OJ trial where we know how the foreign direct people know about anything I mean I'll tell you fired at right now\nIs that right for you you're not aware of how much of a science handwriting analysis is\nAwful windfall for who killed them quite in ... oh I'm not I'm not ... won't shot on my iPod look\nWouldn't you say obviously you know you're you're reacting the way very much the way Charlie did right\nWouldn't you say this is evidence that is so strong that it demands that the press the media and investigative agencies pursue it you you really would tell me it doesn't demand that\nOur man they on the news I agree with you on that part I mean you know\nAll these cover up some things I mean [noise]\n... wake you up our own things through I mean why would the government want to hide you up all his firm out if they found a flying fought for why not tall off I I mean your show is based on conspiracy all the time I read that you know it it makes me nervous no it's not I mean you're telling me there's going to be a war on at a border I I\nI didn't tell you that are between the militia men and I I don't know what's going\nOn I hold you the dean comp to know how to blend to send two hundred and fifty thousand militiamen down to bore yes that is true\nBut what happened with that um if we're lucky not much\nAll I mean it is a big nose a couple of weeks ago you're telling me about all our board\nOn well globally hopefully we manage to um quiet that one down I Hope to hell that's true I brought a information person on national in a militia information person who tried to say it's a bad idea don't\nDo it and with any luck enough people will not do it so we won't have trouble oh okay\nAll right aren't\nAll are pretty straight talk on the air and maybe I you know you turn me around a low but there are I don't know you know kind of makes me nervous about ...\nWell it ought to uh we live in strange times I'm never said there's a little green guys I've never met one I've seen a UFO\n\nOr is it possible the government would known wouldn't tell us of course it's possible\nOf course it's possible\nLet's see now how long did the government keep their secret about the plutonium they fit in some cases to children how long was that our government could they keep that quiet for all those years\nNot only yes but hell yes they did they hid we didn't find out in general

it reported\nAnd uh you know that'd be interesting thing or if Clinton forced out of office so we have a choice between Gore and Powell All right ah it's actually the American people are getting a couple more of a quote this valley apology Democrat your Charlie whatever his name or [noise]\nSo we're getting another choice when a couple of liberals do you see it that way\nWell I don't know yet because I don't know enough about Powell\nPowell came out of New York university before he went to the point\nOf view but that doesn't necessarily mean anything well it\nIt doesn't who came in the

get to this way I don't know if you heard a buzz ... um ... if you go to coast to coast am Dutch come there's there is a really great great piece\nAbout the experiments that inspired Frankenstein so as you're heading into the holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way a this is a it's a fun story to read because it it goes to show you the science behind what was this since ... science fiction story\nBut people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play but it really is in many respects ... one of the first major\nBig selling science fiction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like it was like a I robot both the\n... version and then the robot that came before us most they're all kind of play on the same teams that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation and in fact in the very first\nVersion of a robot before the ... version of a robot um the robot that is created in the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties the sits down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am Doug come to a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crushed UFOs that according to a defense\nInsider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada um and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did\nWell then you know they would it would become the new Raj well\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\nAll right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how about a hundred thousand people um and of course of the month than a quarter million though the massive amount of people that did he die within its

subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... ... there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hangings and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nTry

rare\nOr the Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing

I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah it was really sorry about that then you go but it's the only people said no I'm not going to get this and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anyone\nI didn't write that ... that the nuance of the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs to all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great works of literature and plays is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population using under about fifty thousand but balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see that kind of bumped like that or is it just is like it's a I mean I really do they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh math math I mean some some this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more of a ... year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and throw hats\nAnd the biggest one is October which will never go\nWell I really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state fair they can make their entire year in the weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nPlace it is that those narratives are so good and there are so valuable but why and that's what I studied and one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder\nAnd the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression\nOf sentiment you know the\nThe or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial [noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\n[noise] uh but [noise] this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is it allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime before a death I interviewed I'm\nA true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules never one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish ties the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead in a synagogue where they should have been saying\nThe root cause sham\nThat not run for your life [noise] ah all because of a story seemingly that had been told about\nA Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell\nAnd the unintended consequences that can happen or these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up\nTorch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate about who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experiences on the radio it's important to be mindful of out every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's so many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things have ever happened not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were a conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be\nGuilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too

I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nAnd I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks but very often the serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would cover his track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd it is fresh crime happened to occur\nThe the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the uh with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so ah we ... it was just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly\nWho was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argue that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype to crush right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then successfully after that it is is the years went forward\nAnd yet ... there was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were some times or were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five [noise] the ah I think that he while he used an axe to\nCommit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something but he would use if somebody was awake and could front of him but um and it was not what he was trying to do but it's way we do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is the crime stories\nAre fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our\nOf ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey\nAre part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of\nThe uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime books by the way it alive book I read with the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um that's why it's a\nWay to Weinstein I could have a wife name her\nOr the or I [laughter] I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there was surely going to be here\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is what America Walker who was a an avid reader crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens we're going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it it's very common among writers to be avid reader Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nHuman nature that you do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from sports to me that I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but the cat is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive thing\nPiling on hang on to that thought on crime stories as this will pick it up

I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime book sure\nYeah yeah [noise] ... you know and that's the interesting piece too is is that true crime\nKnow the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution and\nThey would do a sermon just before the execution that would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide the community overall would benefit from his or her death and it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he said what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early best selling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in the ... from the tree and you're trying to\nBring in it even though it's a hundred plus years leader\nIn some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities may be this this lingering sense of some tragedy that had happened maybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how\nThe town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nThe um ... there was an interesting thing that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was\nA a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of crime\nAnd he had always believed that uh uh the man who\nUh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released it always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um\nIt wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to have that was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that but it was it was a ... he\nSaid he was a tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know if there's a lot of different but\nStill didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think it can go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all ... all good books are search for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago\nAnd ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that these ... that these murders occurred in\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was\nOne of the ... ah what how people\nLived that they they lived rich meaningful lie is\nA ... ... people\nIn urban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened to all of the things that happen to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they\nThey got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened to you happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they live or die terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town\nOr a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that just the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about\nThe atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed ... communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I that's what I really liked what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... there's one incident that always sticks with me that illustrate the point you were just bang bang and that has to do with the the taco and the cases taco invent that it\nUh one of them I think it was ... we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty fourth of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um\nA he\nHad a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd an Italian community um a pickle deal because pickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou'd never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago [noise]\nExcept that it's important in\nA crime story that's what kinds of stories are they're these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details of uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYeah but I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm and did the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nBut I really want to get to the part about how you think you live narrowed down this suspect

uh that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity ... along\nSo that you know the early patterns or not that tight but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime it's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that\nThat's who he was like that's uh that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr ... had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced tea\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and he said he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself and his anger and his outrage is not that it in any sense a justification for what he did that but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation in the book has a lot of things we don't know about a year are you you're going to have no after you can have a speculative answers up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and\nPreparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had committed pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been dead at inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while you have if you had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy and then he said he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a banker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents true in about a live the um uh but I don't think\nWhole scenario had come together for him before that\n[noise] but it still isn't that that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yeah um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew\nHe had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm a nurse a sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they just you know they it it's a pinch up thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut uh it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear of Arab ... norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this the ... the ... from the trade is that the from his crime is it ... it was not\nEven not acting in fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller on the map from the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what that James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about\nThis this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right\nBut we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity to lead to dawn and printed book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions so sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also those Clinton minimum to\nEr and I made throw in a strange question about the Boston Springer that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give me the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian\nSign up now for ... or ... ... email newsletter get it today at ... am done\n\nPronounced faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in Salt leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text proud to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P R O U D to seven nine six four or five\nStar cheer on line MBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or in longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about this people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks at\nA bill I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again over shame eight and ... like one of the act\nOf every what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe ah I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and the has been definitively guide to the to the murders than the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAgain you know what the palm will guaranteed by any chance\nNo we don't it disappeared even ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be that he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured out I figured he might have worked for the world rode out he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\n... that he actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... ... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on a weekend this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a ... and if it happens a lot actually up there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on\nWeekends or the or\nBecause they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the perhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that he's a lot of stocking\nBut the the just war himself into the frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow it was it was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen uh and and he he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his\nCriminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so it is his first crime in the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight they did buy a ticket to leave the town and this this led to a trail\nBehind him and place followed his where he had gone on the train or for quite a while but later he was just it was his job as white used to railroad he always tells you that the intersection of two railroad so\nThat would have trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to we'll road you're less chance that year there'll be there'll be stranded waiting for trying to come\nTo terms questioning that really never got what about you\nKnow that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered\nNext to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it's the the train no longer existed um after Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to delay Green Bay or something and you're like uh\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area\nAfter night you know eight he started just morally it more or less trapping it would became a Nineteen Nineteen awake at night and Kenny transition to just running loose across the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole\nMoney that one of the ways you know with him is that lie this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there was a hit he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nUh that that guy little was accused of than it was a robbery and and it yet you know ... at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the\nHandle and you drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up ... fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty four Ninety five and his first crime he just dropped the acts and left his buddy fingerprints\nOn the on the acts up mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle they act in a bucket of water before leaving at the end the crime they did at the last ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career\nThey ah ah which proved that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers you knew what was going on or

Fox News the words of the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania after a gunman stormed a synagogue and opens fire we are dedicating\nThose narratives are so good and there are so valuable but why and that's what I study and one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\nThis is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail\nAnd Lynch somebody

Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell in the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden or national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rest some of the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today so\nI ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about uh people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all clear geographic patterns and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland the next occurs just north of Portland\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve ... the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um ah\nThe ah by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had\nBeen achieved that had begun to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and I had a very infant pile stage\n[noise] men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer tracking this story than required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point\nOut had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then\nSo you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\n[noise] ... yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year at the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose from in Nineteen eleven uh Nineteen twelve which\nWould runner and while he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crime\nRate what we did was say look this this this murderer is way too experienced\nTo have started this in nine eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nThat we don't get nodded walking back toward the first crime\nThat's what I'm getting as it nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nNominal luck and it is not all\n... ... I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nAnd I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder when he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and\nHe would cover his track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to a curve for the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so uh we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but\nWe found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\n... so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then excessively\nAfter that it is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about nine to five the uh I think pretty well he used an axe to\nCommit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stock in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um it was not what he was trying to do but his wife would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and\nAnd being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\nTheir what their general answer the question is a crime stories\nAre fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our\nOf ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me I don't know you but\nBut they're they're part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of\nAnd and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh\nUh that's that's the general answered why I'm obsessive reader crime but by the way of life book I read with the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um that's why it's a way to Weinstein I could have a life name\nAh the ah I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry go there surely it'd be an\nAround people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train 'cause he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that I\n[noise] you're you're fading out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no Kennedy that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day in writing crime at night\n[laughter] yeah they are saying that crime stories are packed into it because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about in the case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate thoughtful entry into the subject\nEither got hooked like a fish\nUh I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and bulldozed Kyla called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well I'm a documentary and far above the normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWhich is that it's relatively obvious\nThat the ... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour into\nInto trying to learn more about the ferries but the the our became a week and the week eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat we tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd became\nBecame an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought what this all just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years later\nIn some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this this lingering sent some some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On my own exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there was a very that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a great great aunt had been\nWas one of the victims of crime Internet here and always believed\nThat uh uh the man who ah was accused of her murder\nAnd was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book\nBag and our book that uh um\nIt wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct yeah\nIt was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about it but it was it was a ... he was headed with this tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow at I don't know why\nIt was important to him to go\nI understand the understanding that there was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know a lot of different but\nStill didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think what we can go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about it is all all all good books our church for understanding\nAnd a lot of the book here is trying to get people to understand the America and which is crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that the ... that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was\nA watery or what how people live\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live\nA papal in\nUrban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that\nHappened ... who happen to have happened to them\n[noise] uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they would die terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere\nOf the tone for the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed around your communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context\nI that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that trait that point you're just back then and that has to do with the the taco and the cases taco him then that it uh one of them I think it would suck co\nWere had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um\nA he had\nA witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd Italian community um a pickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them [laughter] so yeah ... it's ... it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the tally in American communities lived a hundred years ago [noise]\nExcept that it's important in a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf a or something with otherwise be totally forgotten\nYeah [laughter] that I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm and did the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nThe chamber of commerce tribe pipes and let's go wish that both go was known for something else right All right we are ... there is a house where the crime occurred is still standing of his operated as a kind of a more tourism\nOr it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe um [noise] uh but if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah where the ... ... knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nThey um [noise] ah that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial Hi yeah uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a\nProper memorial to the victim victims or mostly poor people most people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community uh thought well and the rigorous efforts to solve the crime was a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to them\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers or there's an effort to try to so it doesn't enough to be like a statue\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his mantra trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and what not an adjoining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell that to house right there um but it still has not forgotten\nOr many places many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but it's ... it's still quite well remembered [noise]\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise] it was really hoping to finish the book before the interview\nBut I really want to get to the part about how you
