been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week in the whole truth just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction hair which already close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by

percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct ten or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're coming right on that clock\nIn stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five

a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high quality bonds and make money which did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down\nBut the biggest bonuses if you preserve your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and you're short the market a little bit\nYou've got money to buy things when they're down imagine if you could buy the best companies or the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're

right\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six\nFive and ten years that we used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far apart there's the far right\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this\nI'm much more difficult it the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are poll right this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan you know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats\nBelieved her the men believed him don't women believe I've never I mean this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest and this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing\nAnd no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people the the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff\nIn the end the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think\nStates like California or the whole west coast or the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground\nIt's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument and its arguments in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kinda like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then\nIf I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter] and and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose\nIt's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global his\nLawn you know here you had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying there timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September the ... won the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the meat\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... apple loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump\nThat pushes gravy train for businesses it the Democrats more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest\n\nGo go\n\n\n\nBam won't come back to cruise to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well Harry within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble and the economy starting in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending\nSo yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been this far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers\nAnd consumers they spend much more of their money that so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nThe orange or does it real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people at the next generation coming in buying so when we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere once that can do to to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much\nBecause they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with a side Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think ...\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and I think that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging that they also tend to have you know capital they raised up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk of two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a fight ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're gonna take your deposits and work in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money other than you need to pay your bills\nBe in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I and I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen in people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal

first one to say that we're getting the better trained people last not happening up here ah in New York former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people leave the state they insist on taking their short sighted\nLeft wing politics with them they go to places\nLike Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war\nAnd us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying make sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats and a starting\nWith that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say\nThis bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck dumb because of liberal democratic policies\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody is big enough to challenge just

because I Want to turn twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly started swiping money out of more fluent account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nHas come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're gonna have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans or to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest\nInflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans\nIt's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nDo thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell we'll hear that I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nAnd you know permanent quantitative easing just for birds the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just send you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they sent everybody at twenty ... every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger\nOnly made the rich richer as only benefitted corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited main skill\nOf the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check and here he is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being in bed but you\nDon't write if they don't spend it or do they you're right that that's much better way to the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nWell hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is Ben and it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems which farms\nWere over expanding and borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have takes procreate money or pork how they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nRight now yeah okay thank you\nAnd I think yeah I just think that's part of one of my question I asked\nA direct them I got one right right right my way around ... why I'm not quite a few more weight on the line\nRight yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my gardening I call it um I don't know what I heard of that she gets answered my question what about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much as ... as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYeah I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger accounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can't insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account if you spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be weightless all of old and and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit for the positives more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and\nYour name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go back there going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash that\nThey can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good thing Carrie thank you were at a time Harry's website at coast to coast damn dot com up next\nA

many ... she has forty years of experience working in the mental health field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University now throughout his entire life\nHe has had many close brushes with death as well starting in the room\nYou said a number of paranormal or anomalous experiences visions pre cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying operations as well welcome to the program Dr many mate is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nAnchor inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died from anytime\nYou know in my book the borders are my first came out many people ask me if the based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nDocuments bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that the doctors should not be paid anything told by a sense and I don't know the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences stories from my readers and to my audience\nAnd from family and friends and then I own extensive reading research into the paranormal\nIn terms of why I had the experience I think it is related to the fact that I had from the coast of that so many ... say that [noise] um you know\nIt's been a lot of ... about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five for that over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated that something like one thirty American is that it had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut it's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were announced clinically dead and never had it on your death ran\nBut when I look at how my clothes precious death affected me I see that I have some of the things after the fact that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience [noise] in other words I'm having had all the close of that\nI tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then he an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because\nI didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences\nBecause there was no rational way to explain them but then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why do they live harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donated it's called an aloe Jeanette transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOf this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ...\nUm yeah and I had it for many years\nWell actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body you\nWas it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he lives an anonymous donor you about\nThe rule at the time was that after you when you I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did read him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC\nAnd the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThen have you still in touch with them the happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is here altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise]\nThey were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is their cheeks swab that's it yeah just to cheeks ought to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bank\nAnd then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what what was brought back to where I live closer but yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I had that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and what's a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel just touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one even if a person has no\nBelief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and they've not sticks have these experiences well as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you do and I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but when you say that what's the basis for what makes you say that\n[noise] [noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or cognitive beams and other things he's talked about such as physicians some voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP until after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about you right now is that very common um and I think everyone has the ability\nIf they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability off runs in families [noise] um\nFox News I'm Carmen robbers hurricane Michael changes the panhandle for ever Florida governor Rick Scott\nThis monster storm devastated the Gulf Coast enter pan handle so many lives have been changed forever\nSo many families have lost everything\nHomes are gone [noise] businesses are gone\nResidents called the destruction\nUnbelievable that Ben in Panama City over sixty years this is the worst I've ever seen and my parents had motels on the beach and it was the worst they've ever seen and we've never left for hurricane\nStorms heading out to the now over Virginia and Congress demands answers from Saudi Arabia about a journalist missing in Turkey\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham is warning there'll be what he calls I bipartisan tsunami building if it turns out that Saudi Arabia was behind the disappearance a possible murder of journalist ...\n... says at Henry this is Fox News [noise]\nLearn to fly on a month or two to get from the CD you could just amazing rate and start dating in any other theses ...

as per normal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they don't tell you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nSo sometimes people have these experiences they have these dreams and they disregard them you know and I've heard of other cases like that too\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I bring up another subject which is sometimes people see messages in dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nSets the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld [noise] you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear mhm\nYou know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nOr there there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that will be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how did we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't it the cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it\nThat I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I thought I I just saw these where it said\nThis is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have permission about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right and in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hey nerd who plays also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition and\nThen they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they'd disregard things which could be dismissed that superstition\nIs always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and they'll yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's going to win the race but didn't bet on that horse but on something else some loss\nIn ... in the movie screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are I don't believe in [noise]\nThey don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they are recovered from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses are what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who is blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the ... and on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth background yeah have you\nBack but then then they said I don't know why put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were well yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component to life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious Israel different words that have been used to describe the same events\nSo I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many makers were going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here

the borders of normal\nAs a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether the person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone who's hearing voices they certain qualities that would distinguish the fake from a psychotic experience for example if someone hears the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery and in fact it may be more than one voice\nToo with the voices talking to each other about the person the voices might be a accusatory or threatening with um fake loose nations and to be infrequent they may occur only once had price in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming\nThe other thing is with psychosis you can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing a voice\nYou have to look at the whole person because psychosis\nIs the major mental disorder which affects\nThe person's ability to function in society whether that person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family if they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other than an aside from the ... for example the thought ...\nOr paranoid id Asian or you know feelings have ...\n... that you played talking but in this type of thing so that it's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it has happened that if a psychologist that did it and experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending\nTo be patient ahah but they were misdiagnosed\nAs it gets ... they're admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the where the patients me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them as completely normal so that's why I say you can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out well unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes well that's true but but the patients didn't\nEffect because well the patients live with it they they know the on the cell well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that said\nAll right let's take some calls for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front ... well that's where I used to go\nAnd out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit\nThat not legal and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be\n[laughter] but you did that it is a remote viewing huh\nNo I ... I found the body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been in the child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell\nNot lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were fighting on the along with us canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven sixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat are you where do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping [laughter]\nOr the other ones where I'd been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but the most interesting experience I think I've ever had in fact I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed\nBecause I'm In physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you are in that\nParticular place of knowing what all the companies seem love is\nAnd when I was during meditation or we think and and I could see if you know what greater looks like in a in

'cause uh I'm a skeptical hurt them and uh I've got degrees a couple of degrees ... and I talked to physics engineering for years so I'm kind of a I Know that kinda gosh you're however\nUh I had a dream that seem to come true uh many years ago when I was in my thirties and a ... and ... says a ... and that's disturbing you know are you a space and time\nUh right now doesn't seem to allow information flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year or two a record my dream and his first I tried a member of the seven days the portable tape recorders are kind of clunky\nMhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like recording play at the same time right\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button [noise] so I went back and just writing things down on paper and of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a dream I figured out a method for that that took me some of the road reliable\nAnd one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual ally ... and then I decided but what happened later in the ... thing\nAnd my wife is a is a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him I'm comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her and a one point\nThe the nail says are and we're outside some kind of a format outside I like you know couldn't figure out the map but anyway he says I'm a dairy I have to go to the bathroom\nYou know where it is and I said no you know until we were had been drinking a cup of the line I thought I Do too and so uh yeah let's go look for it and and the dream we have to walk up a rock side but some kind of structure outside we are a couple of steps\nAnd then there's another walkway going both ways more cables and then we go out for them because like many levels and finally I said oh look a there the bathroom down there\nAnd so I'm walking ahead a and the and the dream and I get to the door and I pushed the bathroom door open\nAnd there and I'm trying to not be gross about this but there I see something unusual and what it was is in math rooms have toilets of course we're you know the doors closing and you're a little of both and then they have\nAll right someone had in here and all gotten number two\nIn other words [laughter] so I stopped in my tracks and and he ran it can be the cello and my parents and he said what are you doing and I said oh\nAh somebody just because something really awful and hair and he said he'd take them and uh at that point\nI had a lot of foreign students I taught in college we recruited all over the middle east and [noise] uh and and the Pacific region Indonesia and Japan and a lot of foreign students in my physics classes\nAnd so I said well you know maybe at that person from another culture if we didn't understand and you know he thought that was the place to go to the bathroom and you know [noise] okay so I wake up\nAnd I thought that's a weird dream I'm going to write this down in some detail I woke my cell phone okay\nThat that kind of Monday I'm almost out of time here so I got to push a\nCouple of days later I got it from an old friend of mine are how are they we were roommates for ... for four years\nAnd the area that I'm In Monterey though later this week the what I mean I Am a white shirt okay so I got a made up on that for that that we got to where somehow\nWhich is an outdoor type side and they watch and exactly what's in the thing that I Do the crime happened\nOh my gosh no I don't know what's paranormal about that but that just one weird dream to be sure many I Want to thank you for being on the program and good luck with the book where do you get the book Manny\n[noise] but failed on Amazon and it's still about Barnes and noble and scalable at tapped it and to go\nSo it's all over the place yeah it's all over the\nPlaywright thanks man he appreciated the borders of normal is website is linked up that\nCoast to coast am dot com tomorrow we talk about fighting off psychic attacks and then of course open lines right here on coast to coast day yeah for Danville auntie Tom Dan\n...

I've never\nI mean this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attack and this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting dishes like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be fact I think\nStates like California or the whole west coast or the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed plumb the red states because they can't agree on anything that there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground\nIt's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument and its

going to\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything\nWe got her I suppose it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest stock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is a one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the big us what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes\nAnd this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global his\nLaw you know here you have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying there timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell you know I mean we were in the same position we were coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen the

markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look\nThis is a river so this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that hum and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but\nIt's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses that way as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special

now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spin and when they would stop spending\nSo yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the differences George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent that we're so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers\nAnd consumers they spend much more of their money that so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nThe orange orange is the real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boomer so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people of the next generation coming in buying so when we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course\nThe aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just go into Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and then we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens we have a regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting and people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farming commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two\nThe disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and in in a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much\nBecause they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise] so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nThat's where I go to Peter in ... Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk of two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine
