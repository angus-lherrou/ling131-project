his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from silver plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um is going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story for going on for ages with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy bonds or post right these are both things that drives people crazy or his\nBook so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people were kind of regret it given what's going on [noise] but ... says everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now\nThis brief that occurred well all the right at the top\nOf the currently found out about this ... months ago\nThey should have publicly about that at that time [noise] apparently there is that they really didn't if they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were\nUm theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that while that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why there are things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they kind of sat on it\nAnd write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion the sudden the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have\nDiscussed that publicly of the first place\nUm and uh it would have been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things\nAnd I'll mention that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month\nPer per

evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until I put the ... cycle because he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nThink Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture show\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they'd show videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter or with the people in the audience they never got hired\nI I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have if you present heroes in fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one in the rose again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in ... people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators were set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines where they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a time I had a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a gambler you know that name of course an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else was his mind now there are some who said doll etched trickery its magic\nBut do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught ... be taught\nWell I've\nOf of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\n... then and there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her\nVery interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier there's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending\nThe context of remote viewing bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability\nWelcome\nBack Marc over with us we'll get to your calls as well this hour works in the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up to ... this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond Lucy nation perhaps it gave the into a window into a reality that we typically don't see with our eyes but I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest there were ... and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one so we'll scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in\nCardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the ... later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamp and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct it's down and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body Intel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nIt boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school has looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report\nThings like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets than the area\nYou can't see those radio signals once they're out there is that a little bit what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see\nBut they're out there\nThat such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary\nA perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes in our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes fill a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist anti materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think\nThere is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but minds are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing your Larry to you know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically I liked it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded the Xanax her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nFact chemically the brain and their work they do affect\nChemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches but going back to ... they can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does it affect the conscious of the mindset that thing that show and here's my question for you it doesn't it showed that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and that type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know\nThe correlation what I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up\nYou have a larger fire\nMore firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness you damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver\nWhich similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen ... what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes there are five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drumming let's say\nExactly what's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and why I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for a ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise] I told comment was set on but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nIt's almost as if the mind the loan has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect but going back to the world on an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI wanted to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir\nA ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole show what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it ... me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise] a lot of things that I that was a I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so

which in yes okay I've seen it work see at work and then seeing the drillers calm\nAnd drill right to that same adapt and there it is ... and ... you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's pose that uh the Dow is er and I've seen that with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and ... over a map\nOkay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all that somebody could they could find water and yet there it is\nUp comes to water [laughter] so are is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the electromagnetic flux than the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties who knows\nWhen she does have the scientists we ... we in science cannot ignore this cannot\nIgnore this going all the way back he your your guest mentioned William James okay all that whole period when all of this a lot of his early early research started into shall we say ... the ... and other other sorts of things and I I I mean I've never seen a U.S I've never seen what I\nThe ... the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw a couple when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I can

to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal up pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin say the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomena much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on even know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field to fix\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglement\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all\nCalled it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light with the fact that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles that there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which\nIf we're all connected and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book in into upside down

is communicated with the deceit shut the age of Fifteen she was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to doubt only understand but also control this gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYeah I Know as you're reading that and thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know very wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know it was someone that was barely renowned in the city and she still is on it now and it's you know the high ... salmon and often when I was\nYounger you are walking around town you know dressed in her her guide and very regal looking very on you know she ... ... ... and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcoming her with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the business and you know and the town of Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft\nAnd um so basically she did you know she really changed the whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of season and it's you know go to Salem um so I think that it really worked out well for the town of sounds\nNo you are a few generations trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family your ship disability what year did to start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if she didn't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirits I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water\nYou know just to you know she told my father she's normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in the matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight\nSo I never really knew her um but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so\nIt's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history is who was might have been stronger than another\nDo the overpass dome stories from one to the other the food you could cheery through\nYou know the only thing\nThat I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know\nThat was her true so she was very unique because that's what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he's started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um [noise] you know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would hope\nTo 'em but it's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really\nYou know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to see one look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation some people it's really going there to to just help um\nHow many people are just so off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using that\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\n[laughter] I'll show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigation is um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well isn't good reason why you don't see it [noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of\nParanormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think there are\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or\nMaybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass 'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items and being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just\nDie as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven and she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the planes itself\nFeel it's a little girl and you've got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering my\nBest friend yeah yeah [laughter]\nHe said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want you here and I thought oh my God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is

thing and one of ... separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted marine comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if\nThere was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's\nIt's one that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment run do you bring with you or it\nVaries on on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more pieces equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know try to bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a ... being seen\nYou might bring more video equipment or you know like they're ... or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies appointing we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nA I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it a charges that they weren't really well I was ... times in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes sons that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one guy do these goes to his 'cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these

know three hundred and sixty degrees and it was one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the law the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself ... she came in and they didn't want her to miss anything so I I just thought they waited for ... I saw her continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat ... is where the coast got because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reported seeing women walking on the wall in that same location so\nThat was kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes on ah\nWhat Iowa lighthouse and benefit pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was on the\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen they serve a dog will crush the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how he drives you hear the cars on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no\nThere's no sign out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd when the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman and she says why would you see and I just had our dog she says can you describe not so sure absolutely as far as clear as day\nAnd I describe that she just stood there and shook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would die\nLighthouse keepers afterward took care of them until the dog actually died and the island she says the dog you described pretty much matches discovery of the\nDog that that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up the coast to coast am dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about going to go to ...

investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we course it was quite common but are there are so many group so like when I first started I always say there was\nA twenty ... the other day it was new that was like twenty four in the country though is like twenty four and a nice city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael does just that image

when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to do a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of the ... area you might want to concentrate your audio recorder serve\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you to hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know they basically uh you know what you expect from us in\nA in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else um but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls free both to view let's go to brandy and

is the definition Ron oh what a ghost becomes why does it become a ghost\nYou know it's the sixty four thousand dollar question Georgian\nEnvy honestly we really don't know exactly what a ghost is I mean ah when I first started doing this I used to work with a Franciscan monks\nAnd we had a cause of religious aspects of it and we come up with the feeling that maybe some of this is the perfect terrific not like it's a punishment but rather\nIts place it's a temporal thing versus the and the thing was so I mean that's just going on doing their time basically but that's I mean that's the only one theory there are many three shifts the tragedy thing is one I always worried about in\nGettysburg was always supposed to be the most part it then that's why it's the most thing but there are there are battles I mean Nagasaki ... I mean thousands of people will till like that why are we seeing like\nAll those goes for running around so there's gotta be certain aspects of that we were unaware of have yet to determine and a ... and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly for sure we have our theories and that's all it is\nAre there any friendly ghosts like Casper or are they all tied the evil [laughter]\nWell well yeah I mean what's what's the guardian angel what's a spirit guide or a ...\nNot the ghost to maybe\n... I guess it depends on what the definition of the ghost might be I mean there's somebody sees their dead grandmother at the side of the bed is that a ghost or is that some kind of entity your spirit or or one of the same\nLevel I always say that number one citing is is what I Believe is a messenger goes nuts somebody who is just passed away and they they come back to see how you're doing or let them

there's something and I have been what and they can never give me a straight answer I've always been curious as to what it is\nAnd have you have you felt that you had something following you oh my

about that at that time [noise] apparently there\nIs that they really didn't if they found that in a during a if I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like\nThat while that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why there are things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient I won't say excuse\nBut ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting a demotion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have\nDiscussed that publicly of the first place\nUm and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these\nYears are trying to find other places to go we're

you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nSo the computer was very the picture shown sometimes it's a violent picture sometimes at the picture of a peaceful landscape like a mountain or river want something that wouldn't arouse the body what we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect\nThink Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture show\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and the the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter uh with the people in the audience they never got hired\nI I don't know if they still use that are not what it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nOr that type of technology that is being used in present cement experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no cycle can nieces is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for the mind\nThat matter the classic study used this random number generators that\nThese are machines that spit out\nThe heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is ask people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it\nProduce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once heroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd and people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators were set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experimenter have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around events that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a time I had a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people were focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened\nBefore the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event yeah\nBefore the event which suggests almost a global ... premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a job or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else which is why it's now there are some who said doll which trickery its magic but the new people believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a candidate B. taught\nCan cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard\nOf of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen

earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote

of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nWell you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that\nStudies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that town

us we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark ... near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up George this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond the nation perhaps it gave them into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest ... and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body in verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the defender later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because the times were being stamp and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct gets down and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school has looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets that they are in you can't see those radio signals but they're out there\nThat a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes fill a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we\nKnow that our eyes only show a very small sliver of reality though I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show up at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational a gift and immaterial asked however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think\nThere is this phenomena going on I just think regarding Andy uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be seeing your Laramie no space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is to simply a I like to\nShore to question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded Xanax her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter] back chemists\nThe brain and therefore they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even an aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that drew the headaches going back to so I made\nIt can affect the brain chemically we know that positively [laughter]\nThe mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is the mines dusting that show and here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments\nKnow there's a correlation what I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire\nLots of firefighters show up\nYou have a larger fire\nMore firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain and a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver\nWhich similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes they're five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so\nIt's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nI charge and why I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for a ban on the show\nWere able to find that three UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in\nA was ball and I believe he was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get\n... who I dealt with over there mhm my\nQuestion is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something where the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind the loan has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world or an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they are localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir\nI'm ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it with me only because of my background [noise] it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise] a lot of things that I that was a I
