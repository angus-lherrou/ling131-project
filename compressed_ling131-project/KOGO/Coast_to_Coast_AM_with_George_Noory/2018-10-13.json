Mac downs on\nEven much says he has on line for me to find that out\nWell how many do you mind Jeffrey believe how many people believed that demons exists if you went out and pulled people\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody how did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative\nEmotional energy throng something called\nActresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel ... and the accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything\nBut we don't we in the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so to monitor spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environment and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere and make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent freeze the Seychelles and freeze extra ...\nI don't belong in a particular religion because where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really\nIt's not necessary there's no such thing as as a distance\nOn a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up\nIt accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know some times are already in the homes from time to come into the home the sense of\nFamily that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to maintain the clarity of their bodies\nAre energy fields and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know a local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah

demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago um I did a free night a and a centrally at a legitimate haunted mansions and very famous I won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgainst for years and years and years for youth all invitation I finally they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and uh so\nUh it was essentially set up for Gulf countries to go in and uh with are quitting and and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in goes had you know when a couple of ... their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in last haunted room of oh they gave me it was actually the nicest Ron too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get business cards people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she it was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my card paid no attention to it and you know\nThis place is really onto and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't\nBite need yeah they'll follow people home negative spirit just they will get\nChanel to get your later so sweeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me with the misshapen spirit sure terrible looking now\nI'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they want I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the parents or something like that deliberately\nOr what the thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was not any\nKind of it sounded like some kind of even lower by\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was the ... you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song\nSlowly and I just I you know ... shot up immediately got up out of my bed and it kinda went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was\nI ... I have no idea how long had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of incantation are spelled immediately or on me you know I Want to change me or from\nIm very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at the at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after her night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just have to learn\nAn extra assist is not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away a you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly and not only in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals that just work in a negative environments\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I guess that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and no longer coming out feeling dreamed because they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit as around them or a negative spirit\nAnd so you know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot Jeffrey\nReally really helps you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients\nThat I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinute already find different things so remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a business\nOr a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people thing\nAnd are these are the complaints that I did and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school ... elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon energy dinner\nElated and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release it\nI teach people how to do that you know and and so sometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clear recession or forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good look like some costs just for you know most all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time\nThank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else but Jeffrey

...\nHe was convicted in a stunning turn of events sentence was commuted to time served\nFor instance undergoing a medical checkup in Germany and will next tend to Washington to meet with President meantime President Trump says he has not spoken to Saudi king Solomon about missing journalist Jamal cause show again promises to call him soon the Turks say they have evidence that he was killed

Virginia\nBy calling now you can wipe your teeth in five minutes using clinically proven power swabs this risk free challenge is for people who smile has been yellow\nBut you know that a person who has a a psychiatric issue even a physical psychiatric issue like ... it's a free any of that or could be seeing things from the other side sometimes\nYou know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves\nWhich unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nAh overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical around and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate threat but actually been working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries to even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle\nI actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some medication for it because it the\nDemonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the\nYou know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things\nThe non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was in her negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the trip pan turtle I gotta\nGo to the other side gets off\nDrugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer steal your stereo or worse you\nDon't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time plenty spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but\nIt's not my job and people who hired me I work for them my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is good that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary 'cause when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they loved it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreamed that it was a dream that wasn't a loose a tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right\nAfter and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but\nShe has been consuming news drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a ... dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nYou're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in ... in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that but we've got open line

and pulled people\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body that work\nFound them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of\nNegative emotional energy drug ... practice something called modern actresses and and that that came out of\nThe idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel ...\nAnd ... it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and soda negative spirits\nSo they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't being the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so to monitor spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of at first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent police say sharman\nPriest exercises I don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared and these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody anyway is really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you know sometimes there are already\nIn the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment\nAnd they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have a clear it out one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nA qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to

Jeffrey Schumann with us we'll get to your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nAre both a just a few years ago um I did a three nights a\nStand essentially at a legitimate haunted mansions and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was\nAgainst for years and years and years for fused all invitations I finally\nUh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and ah so\nAh it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't\nBite need y'all do follow people home negative spirit's just they will get\nYou know that gets you later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh oh four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they won so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's grain possible\nTo describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and and the spirit was the ... you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing ... and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed and ... it kinda went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I had to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after her night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just have to learn\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away a you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere on Skype telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and no longer coming out feeling dreamed because they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit as around them are on negative spirit\nAnd so you know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot Jeffrey really\nReally helps you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing my I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already by different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround six people that is coming in for six months clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy a track negative spirit demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments\nLived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools people go to school I went to this this is the same school ... elementary and high school that my parents went to its old great beautiful but I mean think of the moon energy dinner\nElated and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good mix costs just for you know\nMost all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time\nThank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times developed turmeric and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am a up in Minnesota\nAnd I have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that\nWhat happened off the weeds you board followed me as it said it would\nBut I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I work Christian if all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to refer another question go ahead Jerry\nUh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at the beach and the guy go to church give your money did they do do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that each\nUh this hype it up and basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with the with the whole scenario at the turn people are like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion if it if if the relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus the title is Jean\n...
