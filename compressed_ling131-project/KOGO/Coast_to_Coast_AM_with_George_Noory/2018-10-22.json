... project a groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies he learned as a police officer\nTo the sasquatch legend immersed himself in

all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing

absolutely no good times on the show and I appreciate it [noise]\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when your first year can you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with the worst super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave\nWe yeah Twenty years of a police officer ... years investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance you go about it at your own pace me no your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it so I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel\nAnd I knew that there was Native American history with the topic

I don't know anybody that's\nClaimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla\nEt cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about is never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have had while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles are ... are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on of and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you've made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explorer notes that this thing came up to them while he's on his horse and looked him I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by ... he had never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things haven't happened ridiculously\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and I have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here Hubbard being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] hey you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a Jacques book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this almost fell over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear this\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and uh it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big wild man

today\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou know looking back at your ... your original\nHooper project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like in in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt or these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people I'm just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that are\nSort of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to the to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film and it's you know if people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or ape\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with ah the given one film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet\nIs let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nShe can see with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Patterson gambling film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Dick right and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine of people from China and I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look\nIf they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just fall was ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from a ... it's because we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but there was an incident where somebody's camp fire\nTheir camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just sign of playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California [noise]\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter they knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seeing them awake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks and humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies of people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth\nAnd you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though no no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times\nSeems I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman a policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this\nThey got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter]\nThen the same man told him he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me\nDon't turn around it back on the horse or get back on my TV and Rowley and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property got their\nDogs [laughter] I think when you get the trust somebody dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what a what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big foot ... a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take here or there an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the wood hurting themselves they'll come across it you're stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pounds here a native ... could have done it\nThey don't know how it got way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your on coast to coast am\nWe\nFind out more about two nights just log on to coast to coast am dot com\nNews radio\nNews on all Stevens many members of Congress not buying an official explanation on how Saudi journalist or ... show he was killed in Turkey earlier this month the spotlight now on the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI Believe that five of his top personal bodyguards or those among those currently accused in the Eighteen his personal bodyguards and one of them is said publicly a year ago I don't move with I don't think ... order from the executive\nIllinois Senator Dick Durbin on NBC's Meet the press gas prices dropping down five cents a gallon to to Ninety two for regular right\nNow the high end the sample of cities San Francisco three eighty five for regular grade and the lowest Charleston South Carolina to fifty fine\nWas truly lumber publishers the lumber survey the national average a year ago to forty six a gallon and this is Fox News\nRight lane close until fine am also Ninety four east after twenty eighth street to college ... planes close to five AM roadwork stop and go Traficant Torrey pines under ... between the fifty six in the eight I find that to San Diego traffic on jacking up or\n...

world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been cited before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program or I Am blown away by your book grey tabby here\nFrom\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nActually with a documentary that I thought I was watching it with my dad was about the core and they reduced the story of the ship to align which was the ship that current the bomb and suck [noise]\nAnd I had to know more about it so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter]\nImagine that and you know they're looking to what was available at the library I still find anything somebody's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nKnow I thought out what I could ... thought someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it\nFlash forward graduated from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you ah hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work and I had been praying to have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm In being Indianapolis the storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since ... brothers but we only base mini series\nOn foot so you're going to need to write for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though who your family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I in the navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the way the helper but a eventually over the course of several months\nWe finally met and then ah we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project pick a three and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started re you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely part of what I wanted to tell but\nReally I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did um besides being sent [noise]\nI'll tell you you grab me ... my father was a at ... he drove a landing a craft from those ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about uh the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shed and I'm\nA small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of south now where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on the faithful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater um victorious at us and now as well as nine other major battle\nWell it was a it it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you you have to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're basing them together I guess from people who did know there but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS up in Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on Indian apple story

conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great ... um\nWell with it and then more for published after the war for ... nice to Japanese language\nAnd it was later published by Henry Holt and the safety uh here in America\nAnd it was really an examination of\nJapanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on it voted in Indianapolis that because we were looking at the larger for for me and that they're at World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot\nHe was the commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese that Marines and rarely against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nYeah tend to stories of just men and you know having their buddy right next to them taken you know and they they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack it was not a real rhyme or reason to it and so they were always in fear\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that there are rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realized things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased\nAnd you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported there were so sick they could walk on their back you know from shark to shark that we're underneath them just swimming there\nThey could have there's stand on them there's one account you have a sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down sings drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young EMT and by the name of John Will then he actually took his socks off and thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks and and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put it sucked back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter] so some of the worst effects Lynn are ... happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship a that everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they're having this leader early\nA sale they think across the Philippines the um and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day\nOkay that's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how they're the they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the de hydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would drain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others with you know take\nSmall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gold thing it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels bird\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it'd sunk quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a ... pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... survey you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and\nThere's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still at two and a half a navy personnel at Guam I Believe [laughter]\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they\nHis son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and record at the one he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after\nWhen were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nLynn Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined or conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of drop through the cracks or that made their survival you been more improbable\nWell at their mention there with the departure message that didn't go through from gone to the Philippines there was a tenant I'm looking I who had received a net thing that a ...\nIt's a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well\nHe wasn't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact I had received a a fitness report saying as much but he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrivals of combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non arrivals either and then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion and the Japanese home islands\nSo all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I PV one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check\nWhen I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books are about these pilots do dropped all the supplies and try to give these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto their they can't do any more there are other supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy who's swimming way up\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left in your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to a leaves men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know our ship or else the VP is the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a bird and they carried till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time as when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but ah [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on it that at reporting on the incident at the time did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five\nAnd the war ended on August fourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth and fifteens Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil v J day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five I mean Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over and then maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters at times believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in the last of almost nine hundred men on the very brink of the end of the war\nSyria talked to me about a captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and saying was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nPoor really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the street split their families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved in who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that these are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented the situation and so\nReally you know at the time these names the you know admiral king and fruit limits and all these these men who were essentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nAnd the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify and Turner surname sick I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to cart court marshal there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little ... to talk about the court martial of our mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commanders to testify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain that he failed to the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two churches um and not only was it unprecedented to bring in commend her how she voted to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all\nFor having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels fund and kept in Charles McVeigh was the only happened here was court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way\nAnd maybe we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth and we found these records where the navy was actually casting about to find the charge that they thought would pick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know\nThe the commander of the civic forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral our theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick\nWith Nick day and so what they charged him with was\nFailure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who [noise]\nUm heard him call abandoned ship and then her to pass man demand the second shift as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned what failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across based course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese said commander\nAnd indeed happened make they did these big are these big bagging at evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk but the standing orders that the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion\nUm and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have stuck like that\nWell so yeah it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way that that you know how your debt served in World War two\nWhen been

share with me your thoughts when you heard the news I think it was last year that the Indianapolis had been found a there's a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis and you know bill was contacted by the navy and\nHe called me and since there they found the ship\nI didn't know what he was talking about four in the morning of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the ... group which has the vessel that\nTo tell you what do that's quite a bit to chew on their lips let them tackle at least the last part of that question a nobody on the ship I mean really no one really knew what it was\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this with\nThe most closely guarded secret and the entire war and then I highly classified naval mission that the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and knew what it was and his uh his companion packing game now when it was a long to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would have now and and I don't know that extra precaution with taken\nBecause ship with traveling so fast almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it ah the element of was carried on to the ship and a brief case but there was a lot of funny stories that we are told about what might be in their right to Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this\nLarge crate that delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by marine guard\nAnd of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or tend to toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur [laughter] you know [laughter] no one guest anything close to the bottom [laughter] you\nKnow I thought it was a a an odd post script sort of the the ship itself got blamed in the court marshal labor thrashing around to blame somebody into shifted self got blamed a which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship\nSo they were saying that that was kept in the face followed that with the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty cruiser and Tara mentioned she had a single three to back that when uh all the way through I'm from ... stern and\nEnded in certain cruising conditions in the in the button that craving condition the multiplier tight creeping condition that through back then segment off by water type ... heads and hatch is\nThat in order to cruise and hot how to take a cruise in a slightly different condition which with what's called yolk modified and not let some of those kids I'm not the old or in other words not water type that when the ... was blown off the ship\nAnd she was continuing to make way through the water the with just flowing in three that that a long three attack and so um\nThere were a lot of questions in the court marshal about why that was the case why she why she would open like that and because of that because of this question because of their reporting on this question kind of the families have had last man on the shit I blamed kept the next day even keeping that three deck open when\nStandard procedure\nWill try to get one more call in first time caller Jay W you're on with Lynn Vincent and Sarah blood ...

net er and his uh focus again on the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project but one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program ...\nMe to talk about the ... project a groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the challenge to me ... sketch artist given accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell you may have been focusing on missing or one one the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so here he is with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories news reports dating all the way back to the ears sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me a\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like Bigfoot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows this historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but it wouldn't have to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago\nA when you were first year recap the project how you got started on that what you learned and how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight uh I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with the worst super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that\nIndependently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the ... and they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me no year for kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and\nKept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek were the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nThose hundred and ten samples Phyllis tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have had while or giant human bone\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise]\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live in that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter it's a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car moves article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about with Daniel called I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the ... church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore notes\nThat this thing came up to them while he's on his horse and looked him I I actually spoke to him large hairy by ... he'd never seen before the match this description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church butter de saint church and it's in there\nSo to say that these things happen happen we take it with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here are covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this and uh\nHis book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I

the hoop a project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like in in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nUh these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are they looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that a\nThird of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh when you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to see to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it\nAnd you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film and it's you know if people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo one thing I did with ah again one film it and wanting Harvey has the ability yet\nIs let's say somebody goes in to a bank Rob the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSo you can see with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect so apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Dick right and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\n[noise] well I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences I sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine ah people from China and I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different human look\nYeah they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just fall was ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from a ... 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited ... at work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures they came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed a playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter they knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times they're they're seeing them awake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be a young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder chased him off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big put that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they are not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies of people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth\nAnd you're the feds aren't going to be able to you\nIf I'm clamped up so when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there are never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nBut um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can't ignore it I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm [noise] and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents [noise] so they own a huge cheer for anyone out there and talk to them and this oh I think he's eight years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in a while my cat will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter]\nThen the same\nMan told them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my TV and all the [noise] and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got there so\nDogs [laughter] I think when you get the trust somebody to dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what a what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nOf course the tribal people who are seen them take deer terror there an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the wood\nHunting themselves they'll come across it you're stuck up on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound deer native could have done it and\nThey don't know how it goes way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am\nWe\nFind out more about two nights gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nNews radio [noise]\nHow often does fast enough to fall down way register online and only ... minutes\nFrom my family planning for elections like that in some fashion or something like the session for ... ... hope I'm now forty seven\nSaudi Arabia's king and crown prince of called the son of a journalist killed in Turkey to express their condolences ... died in a fist fight at the Saudi costs when an ... a lot of people aren't buying that but New York Republican Congressman Peter king says President Trump has to thread a needle with his response\nOne two or whether it involves imposing sanctions whether it involves delaying arms sales make your clinic ...
