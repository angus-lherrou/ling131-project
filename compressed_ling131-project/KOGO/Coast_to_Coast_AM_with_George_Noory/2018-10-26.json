again I'm playing my high school or at least once again in a number\nOf genes Jonathan how do we explain this how do you explain this to people who are non believers in all of us who might say oh you just tap ... what do you say to them\nWell first I look at him for a while and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that but I often start with I happen to believe at this point that the past and the president and the future all exists in the infinite realm\nOur human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you were seeing everything that is how do you know that\nWould question the question and often that stop someone\nBecause you one can take a book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it but the image is still there\nTo your to your brain\nJohn do you believe in God\nI Believe in a higher power I Believe in a higher wisdom I Believe in a higher form of energy that I find that there is no other explanation for all of this\nWhere you angry with a higher power when this happened\nYou know George I'm I wasn't and I\nHave had a hard time getting angry I have found the most comfort in accepting the flow if you will that has come my way\nAnd my hope is and my sense is that this flow has a higher meaning that I don't have all the details for but if I go with it rather than fight it\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell one of the few people who really doesn't need a major introduction molten our Gore's award winning journalist\nAnd she's been with us since the beginning of this program ... dot com tonight she's got a series of very special programs starting with planted ex story Linda the just just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and eight people becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen\nI reported at ... dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast than that a new ninth planet or planet X. was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the ... cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shape residue of rock dust and ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son and the crowd of mostly\nI send us goes much further starting where the hype rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth and the sphere shape that surround our entire solar system including the Khyber belt\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at mayor files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like now I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades it was\nTwenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called era out in the ... rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our ship be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote\nIt is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field\nPushes half a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of the planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the tech in Hebrew observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this lose have planet nine or planted act that he uh is\nStill trying to find and he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun though that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than ... June ... good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so\nYou deliberately going\nOn November first started another surge because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation\nThat can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California\nIs astronomy professor Michael Brown\nPredictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the ... up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right what you would see just taking pictures with ...\nWhat about him for rent and fruit is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching\nSimply because we don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky once once we find planet no and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system supporter nations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where it looks I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly ... direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets

look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than Neptune and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have ... ... it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further

like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future\nAnd can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the IT cc report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those best estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on\nMy guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe unfair out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which says or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and how and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are are having to be a ban doesn't both on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger and forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got millions of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing now in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut at least has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency during the Obama administration's climate change\nIt's considered a

silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production cost and industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now solar\nIn fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P.

doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven\nTo ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything that you can set out to

June\n... good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so he deliberately going on November first started another search because the new calculations predict that planet nine it's close to a constellation\nCan only be seen by American I in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California it struck me professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November the date when you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just at visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky once once we find planet now and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even testing the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even see yeah\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean\nWhen we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or not they were inside of our solar system where Neptune and Uranus are but then he got knocked out by Saturn or Jupiter like do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in till we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with this now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like your it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure 'cause we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what the border of\nThat there you have a Oregon right from the man you know the government does in terms of those ... and a half a dozen bodies that are all kinds of gathered together at where the guy prevailed in a cloud in that area\nAnd I think one of the most important part of doing the research project with the scientists\nThat I had no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive that we're trying to move\nInto our solar system what it's called the inner solar system from a mercury aside and mercury out to wear a now and then you're on a star because Pluto or been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hype about\nThat there's nothing they could out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity in math\nAnd I it it would have impact on every single thing and\nThat's when we I would've loved those ... been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would've been able to convince him about that the bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a
