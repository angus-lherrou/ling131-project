has come up with the idea because\nOf that drug and the young folks they ought to\nA drug test the young folks when they go in for a driver's life Mm and that's okay\nThat's that's fine but why not test everybody if they're going to kiss kiss the young folks\nWill lie I I I'll tell you why I think why I'm\nIt's probably because of the Fourth Amendment in other words they probably figure constitutionally they can get away with it when it's a minor but constitutionally they'd probably a cannot get away with it when it's a um somebody who's a ... or you know become Twenty one age of consent is that so that's just a guess\nOkay well it just seems that it's fair to me or that they would do it to the young folks and not others because there's a lot of young adults that\nWell I got

believe that there was a missile involved one type or another and I just wonder what this did not make national news\nWell probably because the investigation is not complete but you're right it's going to be interesting to see what they come up with\nSome time now hopefully finding that their\nTake care uh so do I I Hope for all our sakes that we eventually get an answer to what did happen and uh I Would not pretend to know nor guess\nWhat happened I've gone what purports to be a photograph of a missile that was up on the website for a long long time\nUh people uh had a very mixed reaction to it a photograph taken at a party on Long Island and uh they think it might have been a missile or um\nIt could have been a bomb or it could have been mechanical trouble they're presently leaning toward mechanical trouble there has been no absolute determination made yet I repeat no determination\nMade yeah we'll\nWrong somewhere in my eyes\nPhone\nSee a\nSaw when I\nWas\nI Know the [noise]

know gave a very specific and\nDetailed explanation of what he thought occurred uh to flight eight hundred and as you probably know\nOr the latest thinking not proclamation because there has been known yet ah regarding what they think might have happened with slight eight hundred a match is precisely what major dam said for the record Easter the Rockies you're on the air good morning\nI'm a guy [laughter] well my my heart just dying and die where are you calling from Oklahoma City All right\nAnd I like to ask you a night ... can you like math and five were at that time thing what

guy that talking about earlier about the Bible drink the water\nOh yes I'm mobile drinking water just want to know first thing in this town but that was good uh we\nGet the best bring drinking water probably in the whole county and the whole country\nAnd I'm sure you'd like to keep it that way uh well we will keep it that way there you go this is a good quaint town\nA boy and a lot of horrible idea of putting a match to your drinking water and seeing a flame\nUh uh the guy I think I think he's blaming himself could be a also\nThe main reason I wanted to call I Want to talk about Bob Dole All right a man you know the man is voted his whole life for this country\nYou'll see a house and you know I mean what else can you say what what what what else to the president Meg okay uh what\nElse excuse me what else does a president make yeah you mean ...\n... that that what okay um I mean what else is the ... that does make a president or\nUm you know the man or I mean you know you don't hear anything about any kind of scandals hear him\nA lawyer or the man fought for his country spent three years in hospital it came out about this whole lot to this country ah\nWhy why do you think why do you think he is so far behind in the polls\nWhy do I think Yes sir I I I think\nToo many people do really rely on their thing and don't look enough and to the candidate to really figure out\nThe man is and they rely on TV\nAnd network TV Mars ABC CBS then ... and ah NBC mhm I I think they have a very big by ... and all of their there's all kinds of newspapers and they're all ... all kinds of different media and all that but uh\nMost people I mean there's all kinds of polls that also say that most people do get their news from TV and they believe what they see on TV that is true and I I think it's a shame\n[noise] well I appreciate your culture and we'll see what others have to say\nI'm\nSo you think that people are taking their cue from the media it is true that more people than not get their news from the media from the major media ah what do you think\nWhat are the rest of using the a tactic taken by the ... campaign of late has been to attack the president with regard to the donations made by the Indonesian company\nA liberal do you think of why do you think that is not a\nHe's a good old boy he's the bed on time that boy but uh you're this in franchise with him now you're not too crazy about him I take it\nWell I don't think that he is electable this year if that answers your question and he is not going to be elected\nAnd you think he's going to run again\nUm I don't know uh it's a good question he may allow another candidates or to head the reform party next time and I I really think it's it comes down to that that he will allow because if he runs he will be the candidate\nYeah in my opinion so uh if you set the reform party lose we may get a ... another candidate next time\nOK and just one thing when you had the the two candidates from the the other parties like uh the libertarian yes thing I'm scared about that this guy gets in there and see if they have their way you can imagine\nThat the sweatshops Thirteen year old girls are working twelve hour shifts a lot of safety features will go out the window let alone or legalizing drugs which I think it's crazy\nI uh we have to have some government yeah\nI I Do agree sir I Believe me I Do agree\nI Am very much in the middle and I do agree I Am not able to embrace libertarian philosophy and I really really really like Harry brown use the real thing he believes in what he says I just happen not to agree with all of it\nAre two important non trivial points one is legalized drugs very bad idea in my opinion and the other is open borders\nOr we have every right to control our borders and we should be doing so that is my view east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHi art Steve from South Dakota Hey Steve oh I've got a couple of quick things on the lighter side great and I'm not talking science All right um I received the ah twenty of tapes show of your show or two days ago you did yes and I'm you know cataloguing them all for reference and ah\nGot quaint little library

rain on the other right\nCan you get the artist\nKnow James Taylor firing range\nFiring rain yeah okay well I got that certainly would fit thank you very much a fireman rain the east coast are

moment\nAll by all means trap actually turn it on the whales yeah there you go\nUp and I go home okay um yeah I I wanted to know you can answer a question for me that's been kind of bugging me for the last couple a week um I was reading an article about a high school student that would panic from school because she gave a classmate might all\nUh I don't think it was mine all but it was an aspirin yes\nUm that's just kind of um you know kind of fun with me and I didn't why in the devil they tend to forget given our now\n... well their rule was a no student will give any other students any drug over the counter or otherwise that was the rule\nOh OK answer that did it affect you train at all [noise] yes\nYeah because I thought I read something that a current to another student in a different goal that are either Tylenol or an Advil or something like that and exactly\nThe standard that they're going to have a well I think they found it in a locker ... and I thought well I can imagine you know doing it if they found pot or heroin or something like that and there but uh\nI Know aspirin seems radical yeah I went on the other hand uh there there's a reason for the rules thank you for the call [noise]\nUm it it does sound a little rough but suppose the other students had to had some sort of allergy to that medicine then there would have been a real problem\nThere would have been a real problem and I suppose that's why they have the rule or a little bit strict yes but ah probably proper and they wanted the school nurse to dispense any medicine west of the Rockies you're on the air hockey oh if the bell yes ...\nAlbuquerque New Mexico yeah later on fine\nGood I've been to a couple of factors off and on the past month or two I don't know if we have them ah that at any rate greetings from Albuquerque um this thing with a cat in Australia um my question is do they know for sure it paid for with [noise]\nUm well it did not cover that it's always something to worry about uh I I what worries me is even if they've got it right and they've come up with a virus that will kill cats how can they be sure they're going to keep it in Australia\nYeah that's another concern to it could very easily I Would think they tend to ah [noise] I live with it too I'm On the Italian thank you very much for your show and all of this stuff is getting very very scary they put together what ... says\nAre you guys have the only smart way of doing things you don't change times twice a year\nRight I think we're the only place in the country\nWell there are there may be one other thing I Would very much like to join you want him so sick of changing clocks I could scream\nI was just talking to my wife earlier I must be out of state she's up in Idaho and uh yeah I've kind of frustrating for her she liked it down here as well especially as cold as it is up there right now but she ended up their skin and getting her family and stuff that I said well why don't or on a drive up apparently driving down\nThe corridor Peron [laughter]\nOh no that's the wrong place\nAnd all that but yeah I've been I'm really really enjoying your show it it's a it's a godsend\nAnd that someone would take the time to bring some of these issues or to the air with I mean it's it's like\nI Know you cannot act with impunity I'm sure that there's you know concerns that may LA many of the issues that could be dealt with\nNo really no actually the truth is I can talk about anything I Want\nOh I'm I tend you do when I Do and you certainly do I I was I'm Amazed\nAnd especially listening to some of the you know the ... I mean the the variety of things that you have a play in the back backwards talking that that was just\n... man does not live by politics alone at least I don't and\nTalk radio across America right now is almost in you know unless you're a doctor so and so I'm hoping people out with their emotional problems otherwise a talk radio is all politics all the time it's either going to have to change or as the leading format in America it's going to die out\nWell I you\nKnow I think\nI think you've made a really good point there as well and uh I'm I've been\nHoping that you know I've I've been kind of apathetic about it because it's like a a this place she just got through saying what what do we have to choose from and what do we have to choose from there and\nIt is not a good choice is yours there\nThere's no choice than I was thinking about Nicaragua little Nicaragua I've I've\nBeen all through Latin America I used to live in Central America and uh you know what I call it plays banana republic but they're really quite advanced tie literacy rates very politically minded\nGet twenty three presidential candidates in Nicaragua right and a very close election monitored all computerized you're very well done very very well done I was there and let's see I was there in Nineteen Seventy nine July when the\nSandinistas took over the government and I was in the capital and then I was there ...\n... ... right out of high school oh man that must have really done something yeah two\nOf my buddies taking a trip down to South America in our a post graduation getaway trip kind of thing you know\nThen you went to Nicaragua when Ortega\nTook over yeah well we didn't know that was going on I mean I understand all ethically aware now I understand\nNicaragua just looked like a nice place to visit\nWhile I was part of the itinerary down to ... so we aren't destination\nTo their benefit they did not return Mr or to get a power site goodness that\nYou know what was really amazing was we we were airlifted back by the American embassy they took sure a lot of people they took us back out too I'm sure ... I mean we we had an airbase there are ... or something going on there with before we started helping the country's later but uh\nAnyway they um I noticed in a photo that I saw in a\nIn a print in a ... I'm pretty article ah what do you call them by newspaper down there they had um the that's such a model who became the president um she wrote in town and the victory procession\nAlongside of Daniel Ortega\nYou that's right I recall that thank you very much for the call I recall that and uh the elections or in Nicaragua are definitely a bright spot if we can just do something about ah Cuba or the world will indeed in many ways to be a better place east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning good morning how are you that I Am fine uh my name's Kevin I'm calling from la fountain Indiana gives her about the cats in Australia yes uh I Believe about a year ago um did\nThey not try to get rid of the rabbits and Australia correct okay I I was thinking they they they were trying to do that\nYou know they like designer viruses down there\nI see [noise] um there's one thing that a person has to remember amount to voting for a for do or Clinton this year what's that um Clinton\nOr as approving judges for um\nYou know he's already appointed more judges and has a first term than Reagan ever did both terms that he was elected and he's got a lot more judges to point\nWell you know I Would say that what you're raising is good and valid point except for the fact that if you look at the appointments that require congressional approval ones that were made by Clinton and required approval of the Senate almost inevitably are just like rubber stamps or they were approved\nYeah so I I realize that I I I Would just uh for some reason with thing to do with that I have a little bit more conservative uh uh thinking on when when he goes to a point these judges than what a\nWell I Would certainly like to think so but the record would be that he helped confirm those that were sent to him by President Clinton so why would you think that he has ... would have a a ... wouldn't necessarily uh be\nYou know I think both of them are going to be forced if there is a Republican House as there is now a no matter who would get in to force people in the excuse me to appoint people pretty much in the middle no matter who gets in\nMhm mhm maybe I'm wrong I don't think so well I just thought I'd throw that out at the hands of people out there I I appreciate it one other thing or you know I understand that you've been looking for a which to an interview Oh yes um there's a lady that I seen on on\nThe seven hundred club about a year ago and she was she's no longer which today but she was a heavily involved in it uh\nYeah but she probably preaches the exact opposite today

Martin\nYeah that was very very chilling and very fascinating I think\nHe was right on on about a lot of stuff on when you ask them about the anti Christ and all that I was really my radio started fate and really bad in and out when they started to answer that question started banging on my radio and everything really yeah I said oh no I Want to hear this park because that was a really good question and ah\nAnyway I wanted to ask you do you know anything about that ah the Turkish government\nAre a icon\nYou one day last week and I was a bad bad on the subject of reincarnation and I got the impression you didn't want to talk about it\nI'm pleased to talk about it oh well I'm\nA ... I I wondered if you would get a guest on who would be opposed to it and you said you're gonna have their priests on friday afternoon to the whole program it never came up the subject of reincarnation\nOh I see well I Would I Would have been obvious so I mean as a Catholic priest\nOr what I Wonder if it yet but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I went back to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nI don't want to excuse me what why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they say that we keep reincarnate ing and coming back because they said that the way we learned yes\nYou remember they always say that they say that how we learn yes\nAnd yet on the program friday night you and the priest agreed that that we are a lot I don't know if you remember that but\nMy point I remember it clearly\nYeah when we came we incarnate and to come back at to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in ... which\nIs that it actually getting dumber and dumber and dumber ...\nAnd now there's another problem with the reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words\nYeah more souls yeah right\nSo maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist are being in effect outmoded by the ... coming along who don't know a damn thing\nI don't know why I like now\nWhen you first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a master's is I guess and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but\nI Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor no I haven't changed my mind at all I Do rowing several times as you know\nOh and then I must have math I hear you I I doubt I'm Michelle program but I I never heard him on your program\nOh my oh no\nOh boy well then you must not catch 'em all well I can say 'cause I've had Roy and I would say over\nThe years probably at least a half dozen times I think you've been on this station [noise]\nWell I don't know what station you're listening to the one you're on now ah I'm On three hundred stations ma'am\nWell I Know I mean oh I'm In Las Vegas\nFolks that helps you mean it'd be easy or maybe not since we've been on cable you gee that's right\nWell that's what I mean you know and uh I I Know you had him before that yeah ... ... would you consider having him of course\nI think he's very very interesting and ah or him or any any I guess that would give the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not\nSurprise you if you are found out he did\nA yeah yeah that would I I think I heard him out a lot I've that I've listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that never would want\nBecause people could keep messing up their lives and each time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do better the next time and they never do and then with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see I don't write a well a baby all have them on how 'bout that\nOh I I'm going to make sure I never miss your pope and because I won't know ahead of time you announce it will I usually do announce guess ahead of time I thank you very much are\nYou welcome to share a glad you called and uh that was Las Vegas I'm indeed used to the Rockies or on the air hello\nMike in Nashville Hi Mike how you doing fine Bush and I tried to get through friday when your headphones Martin on her I said I Will too and now a\nHad a couple of questions I wanted to ask him but I Know this had to be popping through your mind did you catch all of the ...

Clinton is acceptable on a morality scale and then has he done the job the answer to that is yes\nAnd that's limited on you know if Richard Nixon was zero\nOkay and an angel is a gym where would you say Bill Clinton would be\nI Would put I Would put Bill Clinton ... port more toward the uh the uh you know toward the lack of morality is going to let me let me say this real fast I mean like kids

closer to Richard Nixon or an ...\nIt's probably closer to Richard Nixon but let me phrase wrote that the that the executive\nTend to be sociopath people with sociopathic personalities\nWho actually are actually be tend to be great a mass murder but they but the thing about it that people who are executives have ... to some extent the route with and be heartless and so if you look at some of our best friends that more morality thing they haven't been very good people but they've been very good executive\nAnd that's why I think that actually helped Bill Clinton hurt and it helps him\nWould you

Las Vegas\nEven know that those two\nThings that you're pointing at or a hundred miles apart you\nKnow hands that are pointing at them are relatively close together\n... the way I think about it is it's going up to the top of a mountain to use your analogy why not only in standing on the very top and jumping off in any direction now you're did no matter what you do\nThe two hands are relatively

be a state's rights issue and that the Supreme Court ah would say the second amendment only applies state by state I once asked I interviewed judge Bork and that's what he said that's what he said he believed\nIt could be the tenth amendment does give us that [noise]\nSo I wouldn't be too much of a hurry especially in the present climate\nBut for for the last three years the Supreme Court has refused to hear any case on the second amendment\nThat's what I said you may you probably ought to be saying thank you because that leaves it in a gray area if it goes to the court that could be it\nYeah [noise] a on a lighter note [laughter] at that conference call you had the other day with a with a oh two or three people um that was that was really fascinating what what are you referring

he spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind which is run by the SBC see\nGraham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the months for march twenty twelve and again for August

Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease [noise]\nUm how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for\nThese people that he considered to be frauds where did that I Know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to rough him up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um\nThat young student who had been on the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right in there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time and this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from\nThis guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nHe was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on the subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point\nIn time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and you say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps\nSome of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of\nOf uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems that makes sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't add any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... is there are so Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nIn another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for so much you know about that because now we get into the say aunts\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and one of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that\nI'm a skeptic I I I'm a ...

posted up the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nOf arguing with anybody and wanted to be with the people that she'd been with her whole life and be accepted by them there's also a lot of confusion and then we should touch on this because I think we should go into everything Arthur Ford himself shortly after I think it was about [noise]\nA couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later you know the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James hike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now with Ford did for this high profile say on with the ... with all the secret do the trick is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on his Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe okay that\nUm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay um the James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV [noise] yes\nAnd and he does a little up front research brings it into the sand and says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking more scene he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his medium Mm abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it that it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight\nShe doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the sand is and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do step on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because\nShe was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years as long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere

talk about it someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nA paint me I'm a ... a portrait of the young FDR\n... you know yeah I was a I always say lose beneficiary of the ... experiment well this guy was born in any way\nWho [laughter] you know I mean is it ... they were just sitting in the news was old world well I mean we're on the ground were quarter mile down the road the Vanderbilt

anyone people at nothing so a ... a ...\nYou know it was ... was out around but not as fellow student\nUm sees all the way through school uh you'd rather loop off and go play football and so forth and uh it was a well hey here's what was that I Want to use but he was a it was something was really a\nWas ace or something I think that anyone was there for the ashtray and\nHis political where it started out with the loss of Maine and help them with the systems and it blossomed than being governor of you are\nA lot of people don't know what I was governor of you or are they forgot they're just not talking about it any more or less a you know he was ... the man now he just talked to him [laughter]\nOlder roles was on a Roosevelt maybe it'll Roosevelt by Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman that he could change the amount of grammar and part of life actually\n[laughter] um\nNo I mean this is the evolution of this person\nShould at least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nI think it was a second ago right\nAnd he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\n... they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what it does that let's just not the way but it was raised by that Roosevelt laid off I Would have done anything differently but what if he was\nUm drawing early a full on especially when it comes out as well so\nYou think a lot of things without unsavory ban some self marrying this person on the funding in a number of rows of you know that name but it was awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York classic now he ... he was also governor of New York we just lose as always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have ... I'm ... I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy sock seem Kmart back in the ... member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV report

V. to rocket program\nI'm almost ... they were getting close to being able to deliver um nuclear bombs and had the United states not got in\nA when they did it may have been too late and imagine nuclear weapons attached to those would be to rockets raining down on on England\nYou know it's incredible uh it's just absolutely incredible when you think about the situation um you know America is an economic chaos they\nKnow they have to get into this war for many reasons to the to spark the economy as well and uh it was just in the he had to FDR was putting a real bad situation\nAnd you know in the first chapter of my book I paint FDR is kind of a villain when I have to do that to set up and murder so I Apologize in advance for anybody reads and gets a time when FDR had to sell our country on this war and I believe he had to sacrifice Pearl Harbor and the lives that I Know it's a terrible thing\nTo say but I uh I think if that's that's how it happened\nIn order to galvanize public support\nRight yeah 'cause he he had already been saying this was Europe's were the ... war well between the the ... the global economy which is not doing anything and the necessary time to get into the war coming through our spies and it was he knew it was time to break gut wrenching decision very gut wrenching decision\nSo that that's a that's how that came into pass you know\nNow that before we get into the U.S in World War two FDR's relationship with Churchill and and then later styling\nI'm struck me a little bit about sort of the enemies list that he had already cultivated through you know the overregulation ... and and ah with with the big corporations in the United states\nOh boy ah [laughter] this guy had that you know there were enemy he hated money you're really didn't affect account because he is magical does he get his hands on so [noise] um and he really\nWho was interested in industry are making money was definitely not his friend I mean he really pissed off some powerful people um I'll run through the list here are the ones that I came up with\nUm the dupont family um George Eastman from Eastman Kodak hurry Firestone same old Colgate Colgate toothpaste or Henry Ford parents still had 'em and re Frick Heinz family the Hilton family who had hotels the melons family who's in charge of the world banks\nUm William top man who was the president of Liberia\nAnd even um ...

Mussolini at first it was an ... Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that that was the last um [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn 'em coverage of the tree and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff\nSo um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nI'm anyway are we going into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there how close\nEngland came to losing the right one they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in weight on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially in France and they got the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to\nWar and now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church who was the one who got the two\nTogether but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time that style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely he was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting mad until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure I\nMean there's ... there's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ...\nMillion FDR it seemed to reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us he was already\nYou know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was\nSuch a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so Stalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think\nIn a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still looks pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in a relatively young guy um but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I Want to back up with a minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway you\nHave loudly so it was a fictitious counted didn't exist it was made a card word basically so they\nCan village a Potemkin village and there you go\nUm he sends all these people home where of literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country into this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you\nKnow in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before so this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot a backdoor dealings in the spring party by style and spelling is the puppet master he uh he was this guy what he managed to accomplish\nIn his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the ... revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party's journals are used to call them\nComrade um what was the comb Conrad index card it was to comb Ghraib we're used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one he knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nThe Senate stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his quote from lenders will become rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\n...

Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease\nUm how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he\nWas an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychics but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic or\nTalking amongst themselves and I think they wanted to wrap them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had been on the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean what happened to come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from\nThis guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit it\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would\nFind a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture\nAnd and uh you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and you say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very sick and\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah\nThis writing on beating on Harry right behind\nHim up that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... and ... in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talk about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nHoudini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nHe didn't want to so I got to jump in here forgive me Thomas I

a couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a more of the and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later you know the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nWith James hike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yes\nYeah yeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven\nFor how let's say on for pike now pikes son had tragically committed suicide the year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with it but on the acreage do three is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a ... a a I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe you should keep very still\nSpeak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James Pike\nThis was the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV [noise]\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the sand and says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this with discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this thing and that's why people say that [laughter]\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case the Houdini case as fun as it is and it is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his medium abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do the same ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and\nHarry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight\nOnly once a year for one night to do the than it is and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know and years as long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kind of makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to prove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick the prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to undo this mistake how all those who lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole can of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue

Mussolini at first it was an ... Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to build the last um [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn 'em coverage of the tree and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff\nSo um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way [noise]\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close\nEngland came to losing the right one\nThey were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go and laid on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then this paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially with France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the British\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course to admit previously and I'm sure she'll really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who got the two\nTogether but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time that style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo you know the answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trust that FDR wasn't going to become a spot one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about rape purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been his fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in the New York times where were they were writing glowing\nA piece about uncle Joe and how wonderful\nSure I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ...\nMillion FDR it seemed to happen in reading your book an FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like the he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStolen didn't need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with Stalin well of course we know as Hitler and its installing hit a pack\nWell Hillary violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on their march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course in midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals were coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want to do it so styling is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little little hard to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later\nIran I think in a terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world ah and still at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still it's pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him\nYou know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy um but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nTo the directors of Hollywood a union leaders are college professors any good at target and they were were ... invitations all expense paid to go over to Russia\nTo see how this this work and they went to a city in the city is names escaping it ... it is listed in my vote and they were to observe how\nRussia did things and how everyone was care for how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country has your you know look at look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit Hemingway you add loudly\nSo it was a fictitious town that didn't exist there was made it hard work basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um he signs
