today is going to be one of those nice mild days and then apparently tonight it all changes Miguel Miller with the national weather service and the gal\nGood morning so tell me what's happening tonight\nWe're looking at some moisture coming in today and tonight and there's going to be some showers tonight and uh through Saturday\nSo how much rain are we talking about you know how cagey I Am about this sort of saying we hear the word rain and sometimes we get a little drizzle\nYeah it it's it's not a slam dunk for sure but we do expect from showers starting tonight continuing tomorrow\nI'm the best chance of showers can be tonight and tomorrow morning for the coastal areas though the best chances kinda migrate eastward into the mountains and the deserts and during the day tomorrow\nSo we might not get much after tomorrow afternoon here near the coast and the amounts are going to be a probably around the San Diego metro going to be about a quarter of an inch a third of an inch thing around there\nUm there is a slight chance of thunderstorms however so if for under storm happens to drop on your neighborhood you're going to get more than that\nThat would be fantastic I miss thunder I really do and you know living near the coast you just don't hear it very often why is that\nWe just have a very stable atmosphere in San Diego most of the year and a only very occasionally do we get instability enough to actually bring in some thunderstorms um her window is pretty small for this for that to happen with this particular system\nUh so I I wouldn't be surprised if no thunder storms happened but there's a little chance\nTo be lucky to get one\nYeah I Would I Would love it now what about this minor coastal flooding its it's possible I guess the um we have an astronomical high tide in some kind of high surf\nRight hum the surf was coming from Sergio and and and but it hasn't panned out the way that the the computer models were telling us the surf would come up\nSo um although we have a pretty high tide later this morning and the surfaces it's kind of peaking about now it's not going to be high enough that it's not a matter of great concern right\nNow as there was a few days ago when the models were really suggesting a lot higher surf so um so I I don't think that there is a great deal of concern for any coastal flooding today\nAll right I Want to go back to the mountains for this for this little rain event that we may know hopefully see and possibly thunder or how much how much rain are we expecting in the mountains because I Know you said that it was going to be more there\nYeah so we're looking at about a half an inch maybe some isolated gauges up there could get an inch but I'm thinking more like a half an inch three quarters of an inch mountains\nOkay so then let's switch gears because then we have Santa Anna's rolling in\n[noise] yeah so behind us behind this trough of low pressure it's\nGoing to move through we get this north easterly flow alive so we get from wins out of the northeast\nAnd there's also an additional a system that's moving through Utah down into Arizona on on Sunday and Monday that's going to really push the winds even harder\nSo we're going to so we're going to get some offshore winds were getting some today but um but the stronger ones are going to come Sunday night Monday morning and we're looking at some places gossiping over fifty miles an hour right now that could even go up and subsequent forecast\nAnd what about the fire danger if we if we do get I mean I Know this is a lot of gas demeaning on your hand though I Apologize for backing you into a corner but if we do get some relatively substantial moisture is that going to protect us from hire fire danger as the Santa Anas roll through\n[noise] uh it it would not really because there wouldn't be enough time for the living vegetation out there to take advantage of that and start to green up a little bit it's going to come on the heels so fast that it's going to be just a matter of an hour or two before those dry winds were dry out\nThe surface and the vegetation and all of that and the dormant vegetation that's out there so I wouldn't put much of a damper on the fire dangers I guess what I'm saying\nOh shoot so are we looking at red flag kind of situation we're\nGoing to be considering that and I'm thinking about that but um um but right\nNow uh it's it's looking like it might not be a long lasting and um so we're we're we're we're looking into it\nAll right and the gal Miller always a pleasure to talk
