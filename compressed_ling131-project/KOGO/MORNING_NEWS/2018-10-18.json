of micro dosing joining us on the cover news live line addiction expert Dr John dive in and good morning again Dr\n... what is a ... exactly what is Mike Rowe dosing explain it to us\nThough every drug every drug has the desired effect and under desired effects you know we talk about side effects but the reality is that it's just effects of drugs and when people take a drug in any kind whether an aspirin or whether it's the cotton or whether that was the\nThere are reasons that things that you want to happen and things you don't want to have the what people are tend to do with Mike or the thing is they try to figure out how to get the only effect that they want with out\nHaving the side effects that they don't want so for example or were saying with Ella E. people Mike reducing this and and the things that they want they want to be more creative they want to be more focused\nThey want to have less depression less anxiety and what they don't want is they don't want to be walking around in a psychedelic have where they they can't function they don't want a the tower and they don't want the ah the possibility of of you know developing psychotic episode and such\nAnd so it's this attempt to walk the razor is that\nUm and and to try to get a what I Want out of the drug without having any of the risk and and unfortunately it it sort of like having a couple of mud in front of you and saying I'm just going to set up a little bit so I get the water\nAnd the dirt unfortunately uh they're they're inseparable and so the it gives people a full sense of safety when in fact the risks still are present in the drug\nWell that'd be and that's what I was going to get to either any such thing as a safe dose of us psychedelic drugs like LSD or mushrooms something like that\nWell we don't know the answer is we we really don't know so there are legitimate studies at Johns Hopkins that one and two thousand sixteen uh NYU or did one also emptied out that there are legitimate very looking at\nA Ella specifically or an L. P. N. and similar other type of pilots five and another type of pollution to\nSee if under medical scrutiny tea and in very controlled environment if they might have a positive impact for example or the the one at at Johns Hopkins\nLooked at people who were sit here and states cancer patients and and they they do them and found that there had basically to improve the quality of life\nBut this was a very small study and and the there is a very are out there so we don't know if these drugs might have some potential medical or mental health benefit in the future but but people have got we have got to realize\nEvery drug has has the potential to give us the desired effect every drug no matter what has the potential uh for for tremendously dangerous things we see this in the opioid crisis today so so the key is I Would encourage people\nTo not be it you know experimenting and trying to figure this out on their own um but but let's see let's what scientists do the work and and see if we can actually answer that question in a legitimate way and the future\nSo a micro dose was considered to be one at twenty to one tenth of a recreational dose whatever the drug is and people are saying\nOh I'm having a a better sex life and and um I paint is gone and my knees and I can study better but as you were saying earlier okay if you take a little tiny bit of LSD or a little tiny piece of a mushroom or something like\nThat can that and will that most likely lead to well maybe I'll take a little more and a little more\nIt it absolutely depends ... there is no way that I could even predicted that a new way that anyone can predict that because he's a really unpredictable drugs\nAnd so all of the potential negative impacts that taking the drugs the higher level\nUh they're all in there with ... thing the other thing is ... what's your number that we are talking about illegal drugs primarily illegal drugs\nAnd so when people are getting these they don't truly know most people who are doing this are not ... who are are making this and know the exact formula so so they're getting it and and they're not really knowing exactly what in it or how strong it is\nSo it you know no matter how much people want to hold themselves into believing that they have thought that they have complete control over their dosing um they they don't they don't even know what what it is\nAnd you know it's not like you know the FDA at having quality control with this guy who's making asked at the base\n[noise] um so the key is that if people are going to do this they they've got to do it with an understanding I discourage that they've got to understand that they are that their idea of control is not real it's a false perception\nAll right Dr John diamond thanks again for joining us\nYou
