News radio is Michael ... good morning Michael\n... guys and happy Tuesday to\nYou to what is the latest this morning\nWell we know that there was quite a difference between the two people that were in courtrooms yesterday hearing the charges leveled against them yet on one hand Robert powers in Pittsburgh accused of\nKilling a loving people want to open fire the synagogue during services Saturday morning he was charged with twenty nine felony counts including eleven count the use of firearms commit murder or eleven count obstruction of the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in debt which is really the hate crime version of it and an eleven state charges including attempted homicide and aggravated assault some of which\nCould be a ... with the death penalty or waiting to hear back on U.S officials at this point um but he was there stone cold stone faced no emotional whatsoever as he sat there hearing the charges\nAnswering questions politely from the judge and requesting to get a a a lawyer from the state on some level which is a clear differentiation from a ... the gentleman who sent out the fourteenth by bombs allegedly Democrats around the country\nAs soon as he got into court in his orange jumpsuit hand behind his back a hair back in ... he began crying he became very emotional before the charges were even ... even leveled against him leading some to leave that maybe\nYou have a case of somebody and and Caesar psych who did not expect things to go the way that they went he was expecting things to be a little bit less important than they were they ended up certainly and then the case of the shooter from Pittsburgh a hundred percent leaning in to the fact that he committed these murders\nSo when I say I was in charge so you know what was what was said you said that he started crying but yeah I mean with\nAll of it hadn't even gotten to the point where the judge had been in there yet as soon as he came into the courtroom about five minutes before the judge even out of the courtroom\nHe was already red faced teary eyed and then began crying I\nThe indication here on some level was that this was something that he just had done in order to try to scare people rather than get involved in charges that that certainly uh could take up to at least according to reports we're hearing of the fourteen pipe bombs uh five federal charges and forty eight years in prison if convicted and now\nThere's a report that there was an additional bomb that was set to CNN in Atlanta yesterday that has the markings of and\nAnd frankly matches up with everything that he had said before that could be a fifteenth bomb that goes on his record and there may be more to come after\nThat you know his family is talking or are they saying that he's had some mental issues\nAnd he's had drug problems if you go back and you see a ... record you you'll see a very lengthy criminal record that involve things going back to Nineteen Ninety four or where he there was a a an abuse of claim by his grandmother who he was living with at the time\nAnd then that was those charges were dropped grandmother she would be able to get him to help he needed on some level and then things evolved from their drug issues or even a report of a bomb threat back in twenty fourteen any made no indication on whether that was something that was sent or if that was phoned\nIn on any level but there was the threat of a bomb against a newspaper at one point in time back in twenty fourteen so it's kind of looks to be somebody who\nWas at least on some level um mentally challenged in regards to stability and quite possibly somebody who was active in this great big world of all of these I'm sort of conspiracy theories\nWell and it's an interesting juxtaposition you have one guy who absolutely seems to have meant a great amount of harm and another guy who I didn't I didn't seem to really actually want to hurt people as much as just frightened them maybe\nNow that that seems to be the case here I mean even when you look at the Pittsburgh shooter when he was brought into the hospital after he was shot by swat police and\nHad been yelling according to reports inside the synagogue that he wanted to kill Jews when he was taken into the hospital he was yelling I Want to kill all the Jews in the hospital and ironically the first three people who are taking care of him were all Jewish\nOr that well he had that yeah there you go on NBC News Michael ...
