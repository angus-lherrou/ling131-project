twelve\nPresident Trump says it certainly appears that missing Washington Post columnist Jim ... is dead joining us on the coconut live line NBC News radio is Michael ... Michael\nGood morning that Happy Friday to you too so what's the latest here\n[noise] uh so what we know is that whatever it was the secretary of state Mike Pompeo told President Trump yesterday a couple of things happened when he had his uh debriefing with President Trump he told the president that the Saudis needed a few more days to investigate the fate of your ...\nAnd that apparently the president agreed with that element of things and and said let's\nGet them finished up their investigation before we make any calls from here\nOr there was also some reports that Mike Pompeo had heard when he was in Turkey the audio recording that the the loose of audio recordings that we're talking about one of them eleven minutes that the Turkish officials said\nApproved the murder of ... and then this morning we heard from Turkey's foreign minister that in the country has not shared any audio recordings from his show gets disappearance with any U.S officials\nNor have they shared any of the transcripts\nOr whatever it is that Mike Pompeo did in fact finding mission over in Saudi Arabia and turkey information he brought back with him cause the president to say that it sounded like at least worst case scenario right now uh that Mr could show he was in the dead it also\nCauses the president to pull treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin from uh the large investment conference that the Saudis were hosting by the crown prince\nAll right now we're also hearing that there were vehicles seen leaving a the conflict that may be heading to a forest\nYeah correct set of watching footage of more than a hundred and fifty closed caption television cameras around the city the Turkish police found that there were two large wooded areas and his temples outskirts that they're focusing on right now that they say that this lack suspicious\nFan belonging to the Saudi diplomatic mission and made their way through the forest on some level there were some blacked out areas where the closed caption television we're not able to access\nBut they found that the vast coming into an out of that on some level their concern is that perhaps they were disposing of the body parts are based upon the the audio proof that they feel they have to show giving dismembered so at this point in time they've sent out cadaver dogs to kind of check the area out\nSee if they can find anything throughout these to force\nNow from what we also understand is Jared Kushner is also very close to the Saudi prince correct\nCorrect yeah he's a he's been a they have a very good relationship and that is a a person that Jared Kushner has said in a Saudi prince is somebody that the u._s. should be believing at this point so um he's still standing tall with the Saudis have to conduct their investigation but\nAnything the Saudis are saying and more importantly hum of the princes saying is that the crown prince should be believed now that's going to be called into question here as we're hearing reports from the New York times\nSaying that the rulers of Saudi Arabia are considering blaming a top intelligence official for this murder\nOr they're looking at a name of the name here's major general ... sorry who was a high ranking advisor but the problem is that the high ranking advisor to the crown prince\nSo this is showing on some level if they decided to do is if they decided to follow through with a plan that this person was responsible for it that's an extraordinary recognition of somebody so close to the crown prince when you've got Jared cushion are saying that this is somebody that we need to believe in the crown prince and their story has changed remarkably since day one\nAnd this could this all turn into some kind of diplomatic crisis\nI think it's kind of at that point right now but I think what's happened is that Mike Pompeo coming back and saying that the Saudis needed to finish their investigation\nHas bought some time for everybody I think it's it's giving us an opportunity to say okay what is worse case scenario where the things that we want to take off the table as far as if they're worse sanctions that needed to be applied that we'd want to stay away from do we want to stay away from the military deal is it okay if we talk about oil and then what is it exactly the Saudis\nWould do to get back at us for those types of sanctions so those kinds of
