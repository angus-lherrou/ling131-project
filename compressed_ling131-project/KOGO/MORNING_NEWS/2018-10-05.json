G. O. P. senators though are remaining undecided amid allegations of sexual misconduct and intense protests dividing the country\nJoining us on the company's lead lined White House correspondent John decker or good morning John\nHey good morning or good morning with Donna how are you both doing today\nVery wells are probably better than the people's writing elevators and Congress will point [laughter]\nI'm thinking of getting confronted a list yeah OK so tell us about this morning's vote\nWorld It's MORNING vote is a procedural vote or that move the process for to ultimately have a vote up or down on judge Kavanaugh on the Senate floor and that could happen that up or down vote on judge Kavanaugh where you need a simple majority\nCould happen as early as tomorrow are still unknown whether Kavanaugh has the support he needs\nTo be confirmed as the Supreme Court justice and the reason that is is because there are or\nUS Senators won Democrats three Republicans who have not yet indicated how they will vote on judge Kavanaugh\nSo what we know about the FBI report that the supplemental investigation anything\nWell I haven't read the report I've seen the executive summary of the report but I haven't read the report are the only people who have read that report or one hundred senators so we have to rely on what their thing about it\nOr what Democrats are thing is that it wasn't for it was in Folsom ah it wasn't the kind of report that necessary to look into someone who\nHas been nominated for a lifetime appointment to the U.S Supreme Court Republican say that it was the kind of report that necessary or who they say refute\nThe allegations of sexual assault that have been leveled against judge Kavanaugh so I think it really depends upon who you ask a in the U.S Senate as to what that report says\nWell not in a John some are saying this morning the Kavanaugh is trying to do some damage control of his own in an op ed piece he wrote for the wall Street Journal\n[noise] he wrote this op ed piece I think because there are some undecided senator for that I mentioned uh that uh are\nConcerned about his temperament after all a we saw that last Thursday in his confirmation hearing or in which he said some things which did not at all sound like someone who is fire to be a Supreme Court justice so it's actually that Wall Street journal\nOpinion pieces one that apologizes for\nA his tone that he had but at the same time he said even though he is set in the journal piece that he got emotional it's also important to keep in mind or what you said in his statement when he testified on September the twenty seventh last Thursday opening line he writes I wrote it might sell\nYesterday afternoon and evening\nNo one has seen a draft of it except for\nOne of my former will walk so he knew what he was saying you know it wasn't like he was caught up in the moment in terms of emotion or he knew what he was saying he wrote it himself and you know I think that whether or not you can from ... to live with what he said before that are set a Judiciary Committee hearing last Thursday\nWill another interesting part independent people are bringing up is that you know he mentioned the Clintons he said this was you know basically kind of a hit job from the left and then in the opinion piece he says there is no place for partisan politics in the Supreme Court so which is it you know ... to where where do we fall there\nYeah that's a really good question you know what he said in a statement a indicates a uh it ... it reads like a partisan statement I'm you know it goes after Democrats that goes after the left wing that was I think the reason [noise]\nAh one of the reason why John Paul even of the former Supreme Court justice appointed by a Republican Gerald Ford said that he has reversed himself and can no longer support the nomination\nOf Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court pretty remarkable you never see a a Supreme Court or a tired Supreme Court justice weighing in on a nominee with their own opinion just unbelievable the the the staff\nThere is so much about this is unprecedented and I mean I'm just I'm curious as to whether in a in a very non partisan kind of way this nomination can move forward or if it is just too chaotic and there is too much or too much emotion surrounding it\nWell it's moving forward that

for the midterm and that would mean that Republicans could hold on to the house could hold on to the Senate and the president would have an opportunity to name someone perhaps even more conservative\nThan Brett Kavanaugh so we got to have everything or a conservative on the bench for decades to come his legacy secure there and also Republican holding on to the house and set it in the mid term I I think that\nIt's Democrats who are energized tremendously if Kavanaugh is confirmed this weekend I think that you'll see that at the mid term elections and so the president may have won a

Murkowski voted no she's considered a key vote\nYes she is so uh this could get very interesting and ... as we said even though they voted yes to send it to the entire Senate that does not mean but they're going to vote yes when it gets\nThere no and all they need is a simple majority to move this forward to the Senate um boy it this has been\nOne of the strangest Supreme Court nomination slash confirmations I've ever seen and I've seen a few in my time I Know that you've seen the ... we spoke\nWith a John decker White House reporter a little bit earlier and one of the things he said was that if you know if Kavanaugh does get confirmed the Supreme Court you know right now Democrats are very energized we're headed into very important in mid term elections elections that determine whether the president gets to move forward\nWith his agenda if the if the the house and Senate roll over to the Democrats than he won't be able to do\nA darn thing there will be nothing that he can get done\nSo it so this is very key on a couple of different levels and he noted that if Kavanaugh is not\nConfirmed to the Supreme Court that may be something that energizes Republicans to vote a head of the mid term elections and there are some Democrats who are running in Republican dominated state who could find themselves on the wrong side of this if that happens\nAnd what what this was coming down through with a lot of senators they say is temperament\nAnd do we saw judge Kavanaugh write an op ed in the wall Street Journal saying look I use the words they shouldn't have views I said some things that I shouldn't have said during my testimony I was emotional I was angry\nOr I shouldn't have been as partisan as I was by mentioning the left are are mentioning uh the Clintons and he said you know that that's that's my bad but he says you know there is no place uh there's there shouldn't be any partisan politics on the Supreme Court but as everyone knows\nThere always is partisan politics\nIn there and there should be I mean that's basically the way the Supreme Court was set up that you have a you know nominees who are brought forth by any party that's in power and you are going to get a a variety of opinions on a court that is making decisions that had to have repercussions throughout the country\nUm Kavanaugh's nomination again just needs fifty one votes to advance if there is a tie vice president Pence will cast a decisive vote in capitals favorite is expected that he will do that okay let's go back to the hearing [noise]\nOkay it was fifty one forty nine yes so it looks like it is going to the full Senate and uh they're saying that could happen as soon as tomorrow\nPerhaps perhaps perhaps a Murkowski I think just through a spam or in the works with her vote no to advance him to\nThe full Senate and a vote there so that's what's going on on Capitol Hill will keep your prize to the situation we expect that we will hear an announcement from Mitch McConnell
