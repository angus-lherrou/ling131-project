...\nJoining us on the ... he was lied line NBC News radios Michael ... Michael\nAt your reporting this morning about an eleven minutes taped it might exist\nYet ... thank you much yet and dean first of all yes\nMike Pompeo says the Saudi king and the Saudis want accountability for the death of journalist jog shocking that they want a thorough and transparent investigation but that's not what the Turks are saying the Turks are saying that\nIndeed they have had the the king obstruct their investigation from the very start rather than pushing this transparent investigation that on pay it was talking about in fact they said that for two weeks they've been trying to get into a conflict but also\nTo the consul general's residence and the only reason they got access yesterday's because the council general fled the country to head back to Saudi Arabia or they're also saying that their investigation has provided some evidence that in the show he was murdered at the consulate including this eleven minutes tape\nThat they're saying is totally different from anything that can show he may have been recording on his apple watches as something that comes from eight different sorts on some level and on that tape they were able to identify one of the voices\nAs a man who was a a a Saudi forensics expert and the Saudi forensics expert tells the men in the room to turn on some music that they can listen to while he's about to dismembered body also according to the wall Street Journal in regards to that tape ... some people who who heard or officials are told the wall Street Journal indicated that\nCould show who we heard a couple of different times may have been interrogated and it may have been an interrogation gone bad not according to the tape the interrogation was that he never happened the ... the drugging never happen at all and in fact he was killed the moment he walked into the consulate and then that this never met began\nDo they know how he was killed\nAt this point in time I think they have those details based upon the tape they haven't released that information also\nThe outside of these sources the Turkish sources and I'm guessing maybe at this point Mike Pompeo's if he hasn't heard the tape it at least heard about the tape from officials are there in Turkey but they're holding on tight to that information that they conduct this investigation to tell those details down the road\nNow do we have a ... one of the problems that we're thinking is this is going to create a diplomatic incident you know Saudi Arabia one of our closest allies are we going to a substantial amount of oil from Saudi Arabia they also kind of mitigate the damage being done by Iran and the middle east this really compromise is them\nIn there also a big weapons fire from us is our biggest customer when it comes to weather so that's a big portion of this as well and another president for instance is concerned that\nAny kind of um sanctions you place on them they would not only reciprocity would they go like tenfold at least that's the threat that the regime but also there's a concern that the president said that they might go to Russia or China to go get their equipment to get their military equipment\nI think that that that they save argument to have but in reality China and Russia are both a trade partners with Iran not likely to dump Iran to go to work with Saudi Arabia on any level so at least at this point on that trait basis it kind of looks like the Saudis might need the U.S more than the U.S needs the Saudis\nWell in the president's so far has been saying uh they're they're not guilty yet or Iraq could this change things I mean they did this tape for maybe what my palm pale finds out\nIt's very possible although I'm concerned as to what Mike my pet my palm pales trying to find out because there are reports that this morning when asked if he had heard any details he said that both he and the king either one of them wanted to talk about the fact of the case which I kind of pot isn't that why you're supposed to be going there and having an investigation to begin with\nMaybe that changes when he gets the turkey and get some facts at that point but at least ... warmer concern right now I I don't necessarily know what kind of facts they're coming back with either prove a point or just prove a point at this point\nAll right Michael thank you so much for the information that is Michael
