at five thirty at the natural history museum and Joe Turner is the head of the tourism authority is with us\nHey Joe good morning good morning All right so how did this come about\nUh yeah it's been over a year's worth the effort that we've been working with National Geographic to really create um some messaging about San Diego but more importantly about ... and the rich cultural heritage we have in San Diego and\nFrom our standpoint it another opportunity to promote San Diego and make sure people understand what a great city living\nWell I mean anybody's ever been here kind of knows that that right [laughter] yeah but\nWe want to hear from\nAll right so a lot of National Geographic after in ... specifically looking at the park\nSure well I'm a commitment we made a\n... from the tourist marketing district to really take ... to the next level and really one of the the great parks in the world and we don't really think it gets the credit I'm outside of our community and people don't recognize it and and all the world stage for so from our standpoint\nWe want to make sure that it becomes a driver a visitation to San Diego we bring lots of people to experience double Oregon to make sure they understand what a great asset it is for our community and and and they should come to San Diego and make sure they visited it's really the cultural heritage San Diego and it's really one of the greatest urban parks in the world\nI Would agree with you on that so what about this story about bell ballpark would surprise let's say even natives or or NATO in Nineteen Ninety you know\nSo it's a it's a four part mini series and uh it's created a around four different messages so the first is\nA talks about San Diego on global park is a city of adventure the second is talking about Scott ... the third big favor the and the fourth diversity so that there's a theme that runs through each one of the four episodes\nAnd start a in the park talks about all the great assets in the park talks about the creativity or the diversity the park and then it goes into the same theme of what's happening in San Diego and then it winds up back in the park to tight altogether so I think people will find out\nA little bit more about ... park um through these different lenses ... see a lot about San Diego people in Sandy with that that that fit in the category of\nCreativity or or how diverse community so we think it's a great opportunity to tell our story and for people to think a little bit differently about the park and about San Diego\n[noise] All right so now you guys are going to be
