technically sworn in Saturday after a fifty forty eight votes in the Senate\nAll right joining us on the ... live line as White House correspondent John decker and John good morning first of all\nGood morning to you how are you doing today\nVery good they are so what's been the reaction to the cabinet victory\nWell obviously the White House is very pleased the president doing a little bit of a victory lap over the weekend uh doing a campaign style rally which was pre planned before that vote was scheduled and he was actually watching the vote take place on the air force one a when a that vote took\nPlace and as you mentioned Brett Kavanaugh will actually hear his her case a as a Supreme Court justice that will be tomorrow uh so uh all of this has happened so quickly and uh obviously a Democrat very disappointed by the ultimate outcome of what happened regarding\nBrett Kavanaugh but they think that their bases now energize heading into the midterm election [noise]\nAll right so I mean I've I've heard talk of of an impeachment of basically more chaos it's it doesn't necessarily just because he's sworn in does not mean that this is over or does it\nWell I think essentially it does I mean there are some Democrats are that are talking about the men of Brett Kavanaugh if they were to retake control of the Senate but impeachment of any federal judge has a very difficult thing you need sixty seven votes for\nAn impeachment and I just don't see that happening\nAre so look this is a battle that with law\nUm by Democrat or that being said they think that it motivate their base of for the midterm election so if that's the case you could you know we don't know if that is the case but if that happens a Democrat could say they lost the battle but they won the war in terms of retake control of the house and Senate\nOh you just answered my next question which was going to be is it possible that the GOP traded majorities in Congress for a conservative high court and in in the long game in the end game is that what you want to do\nWell you know I don't know the answer is I don't know what it is that the White House ah obviously you want it All right you loved 'em right\nYou know you're you're hurt than that you nominated confirmed by the the US Senate you also want to hold onto your majority in both the house and the Senate but sometimes it doesn't work out that way a and that the Supreme Court is a legacy thing so even after President Trump leaves office\nA year who picks now on the Supreme Court likely for the next few\nDecades [noise] ah that's certainly a great thing to have but you also want to control Congress because after all if Congress were to fall\nIn to Democrat hand that means that they would have the power to investigate and the power to subpoena and that's not something you want\n'em if you're the Trump White house so uh we'll know all this a pet and like Donna in about four weeks time or do when the mid term take place and we'll see who is motivated based upon what happened with the uh the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know I Know that Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that she would like to release the FBI investigation what are the chances that that actually happens\nI think the chances are very good if Democrats are retake control of the house or the ... uh I don't think they're good if a Republican maintain control of the house the Senate though a lot of a good sense as to what will happen you know that's obviously\nA Nancy Pelosi hope and wish a and she of course is hoping that Democrat three pick control the house because she said she wants to be speaker of the house once again\nNo Brett Kavanaugh has a an event tonight correctly was president\nThe that is correct there is the swearing in ceremony a of Brett Kavanaugh will happen in the East Room here at the White House it's going to take place at seven o'clock eastern time I'll be in the bathroom or\nThat ceremony and I'm obviously you can certainly imagine every Republican member of the Senate or who voted\nFor Brett Kavanaugh will be invited here to the White House and I I I I'm questioning as to whether or not the law to invite the loan Democrat who also voted for Brett Kavanaugh Joe Manchin but I I think that an invite for him I Will likely come his way and this may have secured his reelection uh\nUh when uh may be premature to talk about this may have secured his reelection in West Virginia after all he was running for reelection ah I think he was pretty secure but uh this may be the the nail on the coffin for opponent\nAll right John decker live at the White House I feel sure that we will be talking to you again next week thank you John\nI think so I have a great day to cocoa News I'm six sixteen\nA change
