initially occurred a legal in Kaiser is somebody that had been spoken to by FBI agent of Saturday a legally Kaiser's attorneys aren't saying anything about that discussion but we didn't know they had a conversation then you can fast forward to yesterday\nWhere you had Charles Weddington was a classmate of judge Kavanaugh's a saying that cabinet was a heavy drinker with regularity and that he would get aggressive assertive and belligerent when he was drunk and\nSo this morning we're hearing because of Charles wanting to this story about cabinet getting into a bar fight\nBack at Yale with someone he believed was the singer of you'll be forty the band you be forty or that turned out that wasn't the singer of the ban you'd be forty the cabin I didn't believe and then\nA bar fight broke out now Kavanaugh was not arrested a friend of his was arrested but police did talk to Kevin ... at that at that particular incident at the bar fight and that's on record so the FBI is investigating that this morning as well\nYou know personally if you're forty was in a bar and I was there I'd probably through I said but that's just beyond that I was behind that I I Would imagine\nPretty much everybody in the bar could have been the singer for you before you can do with that person\nIt would even early ... All right so let's talk about the scope of the investigation because has it changed where you know we're being told yes since ...\nAnd you know it's not changing it's coming from the White House is not coming from the White House what is the scope of the investigation now\nInside your guy basically the FBI is taking what the president is saying at his word we saw the president tweet out throughout the afternoon or early morning yesterday and then come out and saying the press conference yesterday that he was giving the FBI the freedom to do whatever type of investigation they need to do now prior to that we had heard that\nThere were only for people to White House given a thumbs up for the FBI to investigate\nWhich included a mark judge which included as we mentioned earlier another person that was at the party in illegal in Kaiser but that was the extent of just four people well now that's been opened up and we now the the FBI sort of taken it upon themselves to go deeper into this investigation and as of this morning one thing I found interesting is that\nThey're reporting to throw the question exactly one cabinet knew about the Deborah Ramirez assault allegation she's the one who said that he exposed himself to her in college\nAnd I was wondering when the White House may have known about it\nNBC News is reporting the cabinet and his college classmates had been texting each other behind the scenes trying to refute the claim that was going to be coming out in regards to Deborah merits now\nKevin told the Senate Judiciary committee he didn't know about those charges until September twenty or that's what he said under oath when the New Yorker article came out but these tax their screen shot dates going back to July so it's very possible the cabin on while trying to create a defense for himself knew in July of these charges and then when the White House know about them do they know about them before then\nAfter then did they keep quiet on it a lot of questions yet to answer\nAll right NBC News national correspondent Michael Bower with us here on the cocoa news lifeline thank you Michael\nYou guys have a great morning you to cocoa new seven six sixteen would you rather go to the gym or take a nap\nNow\nWas that my outdoor always make quick [laughter]\nUh what we're actually hardwired to do in a lab reported six forty one\nI suspected nap can't give it away okay\nHere's the story is trying to San Diego harbor police around or the car in Harvard drive near downtown at trying to get the driver out after a police chase\nA man accused of trying to hug and kiss two Thirteen year old girls at a Kaiser hospital has been arrested\nWe have your real time traffic and you're updated whether in three minutes on New Year's time six Seventeen\nTo news radio six hungry go go for the latest once again be standing on Chinese his badge and now his marriage\nYour friends can only do so much of a breaking point when a print takes over and then not\nHave your news radio six on pogo ...\nMeyer stores natural disasters and mass casualty incidents are on the rise proposition eleven would save lives by ensuring nine one one medical care is not delaying in an emergency probably eleven establishes into law the longstanding industry practice pain EMTs and paramedics to remain on call\nDuring breaks to respond to a nearby emergency and proper eleven\nProvides EMTs and paramedics with additional Lima level training for responding to active shooters and natural disasters vote yes on eleventh because in an emergency minutes can mean the difference between life and death [noise]\nThey aren't there and when we need them in peace and paramedics bind to emerge from the\nCompetition on living ensures that are provided with women training and mental health care ...

president had a tense exchange with White House reporters yesterday he kept shooting off reporters who asked about Brett Kavanaugh I'm totally finally caved in one on the attack against the media\nBack when I Won I sent a good thing is now the press finally get said now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse and worse now than ever\nTheir logo but that's okay I put up with it\nThe White House correspondent John decker was there a Johnny it\nIt really was a little wide ranging this interview\nYeah it was indeed you know the event was about the signing of the new trade agreement evolving to us to go Canada\nOr the president uh obviously took questions yesterday\nAnd I think the questions were essentially mixed half the questions ... uh involved the trait he'll I asked a question of the president about that ah and then the president took some questions regarding the Kavanaugh nomination and that when you saw the president mix it up with a number of reports\nYeah let's take a listen to what happened to Cecilia Vegas from ABC\nShe shocked that I picked her as I said I'm not thinking of that so I Know you're not thinking you never did\nI had that was a little um interesting\nUh yeah you could say that you could also say it was kind of a impolite or on the president's part a you know that the tourist what's given some grist for the bill for\nA number of uh you know a a news channels today and you know look the president is not afraid to mix it up with reporters and reporters as you saw yesterday not afraid to go toe to toe with President so it's a\nIt's a I think it it seemed like I say this all the time like I met a reality show a at a player that reality t._v. show but never it all day here at the White House had a daughter\nSo less it led to bounce back to Kavanaugh because um he ... he was talking about Kavanaugh saying that he testified about having a little bit of difficulty with drinking but I thought Kavanaugh said the opposite\n[noise] uh well he didn't really delve into that and if anything you're right ... the opposite I don't know what the president was watching I I'm covered every uh every moment of it the most recent confirmation hearing that he had which involve the first part of course balding\nA doctor blog before a and a Kevin always asked numerous times about his drinking Perry some of those turn of the questions sometimes back on some of those democratic questioners who are asking him about that but in a no way did he ever\nA convey the type of thing that the president said he can bait yesterday during his press conference\nSo let's talk about the scope of the investigation I mean is the ... is it now wider or what's happening this morning\nWell I I think the the best people to answer that question you know would be people representing the FBI or the president gave an indication yesterday that he would like to is no problem with having judge Kavanaugh being interviewed no problem with all three accusers\nOf the president as far as uh the issue of sexual assault is concerned being interviewed a\nBut it's ultimately up to the FBI as to who are they interview they don't have much time here we are ... that they have until the end of the week friday\nWhich to wrap up this supplemental investigation into judge Kavanaugh and uh I honestly don't know I don't think anybody does except for people at the FBI know who they have spoken to number one and who they plan to speak to number two before the week is done\nSo we have a a woman in oceanside here in San Diego county who has written a note apparently a couple of weeks to go to ... Harris saying that she was actually raped by Brett Kavanaugh and\nMark judge or the or another man at ... I guess the assumption is that it was mark judge him have you heard any ... any more on this one\nNo that's the first time hearing about that lived on a had a a you know look I I think the FBI um is initially concentrating on what was brought out during the confirmation hearings and you know for any individual who had issues in regards to judge\nBrett Kavanaugh uh the first time they could have raise those issues you know in terms of when he got nominated was back in July\nSo here we are a few months later I question why someone would bring this up at this late stage when we've gone through\nYou know a first round of confirmation hearings which lasted three days and now the second round or a which lasted a full day and now we're hearing this so I'm not questioning whether or not that incident happened with that individual that you're referring to August simply question why it took so long for that person to come forward\nYeah I think she claims you rub illiterate two weeks ago\nRight on the line but a handwritten letter to ... the other we don't\nKnow if you know the FBI is involved in anything like that but we'll be keeping an eye on it and I know you will John thank
