House has not micromanaging the FBI investigation process into Brett Kavanaugh Sanders says the Senate is dictating the terms of the investigation and the White House is out of the way completely\nJoining us on the go news online White House correspondent John decker or good morning John\nHey good morning how are you vote in a federal Donna good\nSo that's what Sarah Sanders was saying but there are also reports that Senate Republicans are working was White House counsel Don McGahn who's trying to make the investigation as narrow as possible so what do we know this morning\nWell yes we've heard this from the president he put out a tweet\nA indicating that he has not placed any limits on this week long supplemental FBI investigation he tweeted that he wanted FBI agents to interview whoever they deem appropriate at their discretion\nBut we're also hearing that a for instance they're not going to be looking into one of the allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh coming from the woman who is represented by a lawyer or Stormy Daniels the adult\nFilm actress who is suing the president so I don't know the extent to which\nThis will be a full scale investigation\nLooking into a numerous allegations right now it looks like it's centered on just to uh the one level by a doctor bloody or we heard from last week in her testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee and the other\nAllegation coming from Debbie ... mirror that that a Yale I made a Brett Kavanaugh who claimed the capital boat himself to her when they were hurt your students it yeah\nSo I I thought Jeff Flake was pretty clear on why he was putting forth the uh the idea of this investigation and he said several times limited in scope and time\n[noise] ah well that's right that with the agreement that\nUh Jeff Flake came to the fourth Republican with Democrats that it's going to be one week in time I heard from ... uh I didn't hear I read and James Comey over the weekend he wrote an op ed piece in\nWhich he said look you normally you don't put time constraints on investigation being conducted by the FBI but at the same time he said the FBI can finish the investigation\nWithin one week time so I Would expect a sort of based upon that that by the week then we should have that supplemental investigation completed\nA and that report can then be given to the Senate or which will then in turn determined wet weather and win a vote on Brett Kavanaugh will take quite\nPutting your attorney hat on and as well as your broadcasting you know knowledge and your what you know about the White House what are the chances that he will actually be confirmed\nA well you know I think anybody that make that determination at this point without knowing what it is it the FBI come back with in terms of their supplemental investigation\nIs putting the cart before the horse so I think it's premature to say he's definitely be can going to be confirmed or it's definitely not going to be confirmed I think it really is up to the FBI in terms of whether or not they have the information\nThat exonerate Brett Kavanaugh or raises more questions about Brecht capital a so we'll have that you asked me that question a won the report is complete a Ted I can give you a better answer\nBut if it does raise more questions than what they did a\nGreat yeah I mean if it does raise more questions than I think that the two Republican senators who have been on the fence undecided on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination they give them a reason to perhaps vote against him and they wouldn't wait until a vote on the Senate floor they would put out of state\nMen and a won the vote or have essentially been counted by the Senate whip John Cornyn they may realize they don't have the vote it can harm and that would mean that the president would then have to quickly nominate another individual to feel that they can see it on the U.S Supreme Court\nNow let's say you know worst case scenario that happens Brett Kavanaugh has taken off the table as a potential Supreme Court justice at how quickly can they work to get confirmation can they get it done before the midterm

looking at a possible vote for him on the Senate floor during that time he met with\nJust about every US Senator that wanted to meet with him and if they knew them and he has put forward the
