Blasey Ford is condemning the president for mocking his client who was said she was sexually assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when they were teenagers\nJoining us on the companies lied line as White House correspondent John decker good morning John\nGood morning a tag in mourning with Donna how are you doing today\nGood All right so we're going to play some sound this happened at the into a political rally in Mississippi so here's what he said\nThis job\nI had I had one\nWell do you think it was it was one of ... how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember\n... so that him talking about like Christine Blasey Ford what's been the reaction to this\nWill\nUh certainly we see a reaction coming from Christine Blasey Ford's attorney or who said this is the reason why it's so difficult\nFor a victim of sexual assault to come forward because you\nYou risk being mocked or if you do that and I think that that's a fair description of what the president was doing last night at that rally in Mississippi was mocking a portion of her testimony are sworn testimony to the Senate or you know which is very different from what the president said\nWhen asked about Christine Blasey Ford in the oval office less than a week ago\nHe called her a very credible witness a it's obviously different when you speak to your supporters at a campaign style rally the president playing to his base that when you you know\nOr asked a question like that and the oval office so I think that's what's at play here the big question Ted and like Donna is whether you know this motivate a individual on either side of this issue on election day in the mid term you know will this motivate the president's supporters will motivate the president's detractors\nWell and and so there's this on the FBI investigation Christine Blasey Ford's attorney said that the FBI has not spoken to her and do they need to considering the testimony that's out there who are written statement et cetera or is this a big\nHoops [noise] no I don't think it's a big group a you know as you know from watching her testimony she answered\nEvery question asked her a by the ten Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee out and and answered all the questions that\nWere asked to her by the uh outside counsel that prosecutor\nThat Republicans hired so not only do they have the statement that very detailed statement to the rest of her ability but they also have her answers to questions that were posed up her all under oath all worn testimony\nAnd I think that's all they really need a unless you know there's something that Christine Blasey Ford left out that wasn't covered during the hearing it I don't think that's the case [noise]\nAll right let's switch here John the president facing a lot of questions this morning this this uh broke last night about whether he built his wealth with what some are calling tax schemes now can you explain what's happening here\nWill the New York times did a very lengthy story or in this story they claim that the president received at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars in today's money from his father New York real estate business and the time that that much of that money\nCame through as you put it Ted questionable questionable tax ... back in the Nineteen nineties according to these tax returns and financial records that were confidential and obtained by the time the president and his family set up a what the times caught a phony corporation\nIn an effort to disguise millions of dollars in here from their parents or as you know a lawyer for the president has called this article highly defamatory extremely inaccurate the president tweeting about it today\nUh but you know much as being made of this story which is very lengthy and it gets a lot of prominent play and the New York times today\nCould this be one of the reasons why he's been reluctant to\nTurn over his tax returns\nIt could be a you know obviously there's speculation you know what's in there you know a lack of a gift to charity and that the fact or not the fact that the possibility\nThat uh you know he's not paying his fair share in terms of a percentage of of taxes to the federal government [noise] um so I don't know I don't think anybody knows unless we see the president\nTax return a and the president as I said uh putting out a tweet ... moment go uh taking issue with this story said the failing New York times it's something I've never seen before they use the concept of time value of money and doing a very old boring and often coat on me\nSo that's the way the White House ... ... a viewer hit [noise]\nAll right John thank you so much for your time I'm
