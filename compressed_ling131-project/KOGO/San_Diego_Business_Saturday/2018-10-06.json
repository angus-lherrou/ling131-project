{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "Sure I'll breeze so ah the D. S. T. for short is a legal entity and it was created under the laws of the state of Delaware\nAnd it's structured appropriately by good high quality real estate sponsor we've we've worked with many over the years it could be a good ... potential solution Aubrey for those seeking at ten thirty one exchange replacement properties without having to go look for the property themselves without having to go qualify for the loan for themselves and having to do individual due diligence on their own\nUm these ds T basically allows each owner to become a beneficial interest in this ds T which is counted as are having an undivided fractional interest in the underlying real estate that could be apartments\nIt can be retail as you said self storage medical office buildings industrial so again you are basically swapping out of a property where you had total ownership potentially just in one property and now you have the ability to have fractional ownership\nAnd sometimes many different types of properties because the minimum ... are a hundred thousand dollars typically\nAnd typically this is a great way if people are tired of property management there's pros and cons forest of everything and we discuss we try to be neutral we tried to be fair we try to be balancing these workshops we don't try to encourage people to do anything other than to get educated so\nLet's talk about the pros of ds T and the negatives of ds T let me start with a negative force in my opinion again you and I have not planned this radio show we just been doing this for four hundred times over the last Fifteen Years\nLehman negatives forest of a D. S. T. where you only partial interest in a very large building could be a Home Depot could be a Wal Mart could be an apartment complex of four or five hundred units in the middle of the United states or east coast west coast typically south east\nWhere you are a partial owner interest\nYou actually are on titled or and again you may be owning a piece of a\nForty million dollar apartment complex in them in Colorado for example\nAnd force the negative on that is that you do not have management control you say okay I'm going to pass the control to the sponsor the sponsors job is to buy the property manager property raise the rent and hopefully one of these days sell the property with a profit\nAnd obviously only the owners share in the appreciation so during the cash flow in period generally again the the cash flow will vary forest but let's say an average of five percent\nSo someone that has a million dollars of equity and we'll get approximately projected about fifty thousand dollars a year income pay monthly and it's largely not tax deferred tax because the interest adoption or mortgage and ... property so that one million dollars for as\nThey could own interest in five apartment complexes all of the United states with different sponsors\nSo to me that makes a lot of sense if people are willing to say OK I'm tired of these headaches I just want more time with my kids I Want to have some time with travel I wanted to go to Tahiti I Want more time this is a nice way to pass that that responsibility to these organizations\nAnd get those projected decent cash flow again largely not tax a tax deferred and then hopefully one of these days five to seven years or longer or longer shorter the property will be sold and you'll enjoy potentially the appreciation and the profits\nThat's right I see so many many pros and cons and and on top of just qualifying based on that worth which allows us to have the conversation we go through a careful analysis and making sure the strategy is right for you real estate is not liquid neither is a D. S. T. right the property you own today is not guaranteed well the DSD on real estate is not guaranteed\nThere's cost to everything right on race that you have to carefully consider the cost associated with purchasing a ds T versus the cost of I guess let's call it the er the IRS and the franchise tax board cost their expenses to going that route to and deciding not to do the ten thirty one exchange\nAnd yes we are going to run into those people every that still want to have some management responsibility and and and maybe it's not terrible teeth and then well we would suggest maybe keeping one or two of your property so you can continue doing that if you enjoy it and maybe diversify with a Delaware statutory trust the minimum or just a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd you're able to spread that risk around different parts of the United states in different ethic classes apartments retail industrial self storage sometimes\nForce we occasionally and have a number of people right now that's husband wife they own a big apartment complex they have four or five kids all of the children there's adult children if you will only the United states and they're worried about estate planning\nBecause when they ultimately passed away there's three or four kids saying well I Will keep the property now I Want to sell the property becomes a real problem so many times this ds T where they own interest in lots of different properties\nAnd allows estate planning to be really really well done because the kids can inherit apiece keep it or sell it so I think some of the benefits obviously the ds T we talked about the negatives\nThe negatives as you give up control\nAnd then it gives there's typically associated with having a DSD ownership because it obviously it takes a sponsor a lot of time and a lot of expense to find a property to buy a property manager property and then the cash flow is typically paid to the owners of the property and then the appreciation of a hundred percent by the way it goes to the owner\nSo some of the benefits is I think the key benefit forest is most of our clients are in their seventies and eighties and we can say hey you can do one of these are the Estes\nOr you can do for all the taxes and you can have no management responsibilities you get that projected check every month in the mailbox goes right into your account you get a ten Ninety nine percent of the year and you give that to your account on and you're able to get the tax benefits but the big key is the difference of tax\n[noise] one of the examples for as I recall we have one couple that has a property they bolt Thirty years ago they have no doubt on the property's worth about three million dollars they're tired of the headaches of property management\nAnd uh they went to their CPA a PR us by the way and his CPA said oh by the way if you sell that property they three million dollar profit are three million dollar again is ...\nBruce ... when we all get together and we start talking about and useless and Yelp and home advisor we'll just cringe we've exactly none of us participate in those um advertising or by leads from them just just because of the process and and how they treat us down along the consumers\nAnd I have this visual of those services like a bingo ball wheel where you're rolling it and you the number that comes up do you have no control over what is going to come up yeah maybe there's a lot of balls in that as a consumer ... has a pro war as a consumer as a consumer how's\nIt going to react 'cause you know you're you put in your personal information and the way it works for for ... from judging from what I see I don't I don't know all their formulas but you put in the information and they sell that lead to they say three but I think it's many more than that I Believe I ... and the companies that pay the most come up the most\nRight and not ... they'll sell to the Celtic companies direct for you know maybe three but then they'll turn around and sell that list also so that you'll get 'em on the back channel more leads um and and your your information will be sold to two other companies\nYeah you get spanned I mean as you get you feel like you just by God violate as what but it feels like when I talk to people about it and most folks do once they never do it again and and\nAnd like you said Thirteen clinics Thirteen clicks to try to get to where you can get\nA [noise] talk to somebody or get an appointment will try to fight I and I seen them you know what they do that psychologically so committed you're all that far in you might as well give them your personal information\nIn contrast and granted approved ... you go on there you look up solar by ... electric you get my phone number you give us a call ... ... and all you have to do if you were window filled with ... and you don't have to put in\n... and then the information there and you control right point I'd like to make is the services that we offer through approved tone pros you you don't want to go through one of those other sources to find companies yeah no no ... is\nI don't know why anybody would come to us and and the thing is we don't have it listed on the site will find it for you we will do the legwork to go find a company that we can\nUh that will make the call me on or usually the ones that that does that work for us but and also our pros are guaranteed we guarantee that you have a good experience with our pros or will step in to help make it right so\nJust a little bit about us ah and another pro that I Want to talk

member of the ... network for just a just a little bit a little over a couple of months now Greg right well it's a great companies are always in demand and and you guys ever in his room knows that\nBut sometimes that demand can be overwhelming and right now that's happening for matrix plumbing 'cause they've got ... ... what was happening you just ... a lot of calls coming in for

they fit me in and Ricky\nHimself went out there and handled the service and called me and for me what was going on and so I really appreciate that\nAnd that's important is the way he does business and so I'm given a message out there to anybody who's a plumber\nThis working for another plumbing company that is not in our network and I want somebody from our network but there's a lot of other ... plumbing companies out there if\nYou're a plumber and you are not happy and your job and Ricky there they might be overworked underpaid right what are the things might be my people in other plumbing companies be feeling right now\nMaybe not appreciated um you know there's a lot of time or you do work hard work and you go on under appreciated and matrix one if they'll appreciate it every time you do something every time you get a good review we want to let you know that you are appreciate it\nAnd that's awesome and all the other thing to say is you do it the right way you don't cut corners you don't cheat people you don't you know you don't do the\nQuestionable business practices like a lot of companies do so if you're\nUm a plumber you need to talk to Ricky ... majors blaming

electric bill maybe they left you know a little bit on the table 'cause it can fit in big enough system in there and they they thought something's wrong my electric bill is the largest I've ever seen\nSo to put this in perspective when or how far back was it that ... kilowatts we're about ten cents per kilowatt\nYeah probably um eight eight years ago it was ten till eleven cents per kilowatt and it was tiered so there were for two years so the more you use the higher went so people would only by down their top tears cheer for two or three\nAnd now there's two tiers and it's between twenty nine cents and sixty cents there's\nThree cheers three cheers there's three terms there's a very low tier and then it goes way up for the super high user\nWhen we come back after the break we're going

we're right neck and neck with a lot of the other um California counties ... big investor owned utilities in the in the state are the highest in the continental United States him so we're paying the highest utility rates\nAre and there's a variety of reasons for that and we just also had a hot summer so people were running there occasionally among the hottest August on record and and you know I I
