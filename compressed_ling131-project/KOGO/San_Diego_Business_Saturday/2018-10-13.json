ready to handle all areas of\nPlumbing um and and you can do all all kinds of different things for people but the holidays we talked about uh that we are going to mention that and my story was probably a common when I was dumb enough not seeing anybody else the dumb as he done this I just I Know I was dumb uh I\nWell there's a lot of dumb stories I can tell so sensitive about the worst of the dumb stories are guy who got a lot worse than that and their grab bag of dumped Sean stuff um but I was taking the heels of the sweet potatoes and I put them into what the government is supposed to ... garbage right\nWrong wrong I found that real quick well worse\nThe those pills or corn hush [noise]\nYou know anything that's going to call your garbage just Bowser your dream lines not going to be good so yeah I mean I don't really have a preference I just [laughter]\nSo what so people probably off and do the same thing garbage disposal aren't designed to dispose of garbage correct flat out what should you put down a garbage as well\nSo what you're supposed to do on a garbage disposal is you use um minimal food down there you know it is for made for waste but it's not made for large quantities of way so that you scrape that off into the trash great right off into the trash and then you can go ahead and rent it out in\nGarbage disposal area so I have a question because I get in trouble for this and so I stopped doing it but coffee grinder is that something to worry about putting down a garbage disposal yeah we\nHe had all too often in commercial buildings everyone wants to do the coffee grounds down in the garbage disposal and what it does because it's so fine it packs up into the ... when he gets clogged so then we have to go over there with a huge thing full of coffee and nasty stuff and people are complaining and so once again\nMy wife is right and I'm wrong\nHave an email from that's always the case wives are always correct um so okay so it definitely the garbage disposal as probably the number one holiday um mistake that people make\nA yeah as far as garbage disposal now if you're looking for um maybe get some maintenance before the holidays check your main line no maybe get snake doubt\nThat's a great idea so preventative maintenance before I'm Talking about that 'cause I I Want to get into some other things that could happen during holiday but ... to ... ... worth of pounded here so if you came out what what would you do to be able to take a take a look at some of these home and make sure that they're very unlikely to have any trouble\nWell we can do a um plumbing inspection we also do a video camera inspections for the sewer line and if you are leaving your house for the holidays you can shut the water off to prevent any flooding from happening\nSo that's that's that's a great a great point I Want to get to that so if if if you if they call you out you can do the inspection the camera inspection you're looking at the sewer lines are looking at at the different areas to make sure that there is no stoppage is there anything like that that could cause a problem\nYeah directly measure that the the line as clear\nAnd I'm sure you see this in remodeling we see so many homes that still have old cast iron or even sometimes clay and um you just need to get those lines camera and sometimes they have to be replaced sometimes you may get lucky with cast iron and it just needs to be a um hydro jetted and you're good to go right\nYeah correct so not in every application do you have to rely on our change out somebody sewer line it could be just a simple maintenance as you know renting a snake down it are just hydro jetting the line and just clearing it out making it free and clear of all the breeze\nAnd a few hundred dollars you know right now to have you come out and do camera and you know and check it out can avoid problems during the holidays\n... probably be a lot cheaper\nAs well oh yeah and sending you want to do anyway because you don't want to have to have a problem that builds up is going to always more expensive than a problem that you deal with early in the\nIn about the inconvenience when you have your own family their own mind backs up\nAnd nothing worse yeah so I was told a long time ago uh that floods and plumbing cause never come at a convenient time [laughter]\nYeah but you guys specializes in making a bad day better what's the number somebody calls if it's a schedule that uh the preventative maintenance as it is very inexpensive um ... or if you need any plumbing or listen to bring him\nOn the phone number six one nine five zero five nine seven nine six\nOr ... let's talk about you mentioned if you're leaving your home for the holidays that that's an a time when people's homes flood oftentimes when they're on vacation this little things like a backed up toilet can overflow if it continues running there's a lot of things can happen to you recommend turn your water off you're
