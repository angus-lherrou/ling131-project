{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "Absolutely so I'm with the CIA apartments and they have about\nJust over thirty six years of industry experience which they really know the apartment market here in San Diego and generally they worked with a lot of owners that are\nIn the same situation as our case study where the folks have owned this apartment building for almost three decades they're ready to sell they're ready to get out from underneath managing into very management intensive business so they called me\nI sit down with them help them find out what the property is worth we pass that onto the ten thirty one exchange intermediary which is bill and then we start looking at the choices I'm One of those choices that many owners roll into is what's called a single tenant triple net investment property\nAnd essentially what that is ... is a a commercial investment property it could be a a McDonald's that could be a Taco Bell which is the example we use in the workshop or it could be a Walgreens and essentially those companies these corporate\nNational companies they don't own the real estate they leased the real estate an owner or investor by that piece of property and the reason that they call it and triple net and and and property is because it's net\nOf taxes net of insurance and net of any type of\nMaintenance so that the corporation covers it and essentially the owner just received a check in the mail\nSo the bottom line bill and hug if people do in exchange they really have to directions to take if they want to continue owning real estate is Doug just said that continue being an active owner they own their property one hundred percent they continue actively owning the property\nPitching property and they have one hundred percent control of the property\nAnd generally in my opinion a that typically people to have a black hair kind of like that direction\nBuilt a lot of in a lot of the people that are tending to workshop the way home rather than being an active owner build it can be a passing owner\nAnd we use the term Delaware statutory trust bill define what that is and we can talk about who should consider that as being an active owner and who should consider being the past the Boehner and the DSD\nWe get a lot of clients who are tired of property management headache so it'd be terrible cheeses you referred to it and they're just done with all the headaches that go with that the midnight phone call because the toilet is leaking or the water heater blew up or something like that\nBill I don't mean to interrupt you but I'm going to interrupt you I was with a couple that attended one of the workshop we made in my conference room afterwards\nAnd they're probably listening but they've owned a office building in Carlsbad for many many many many years and they said that they were on a cruise and they've got a phone call from one of the tenets and they're building and they said they were out of toilet tissue\n[laughter] that is a problem\nI met I met a guy I met a guy this week I have a single family property and ... and he rented it to\nTo students and he checked ... if he actually checked on their property because some of the neighbors had complain six people over there and I don't understand it but there was a he said there was a poll some kind of poll in the in the in the living room\nAnd I think one of the attendance was a dancer that practice\n[laughter] dancing dancing and that and I hear all kinds of funny stories\nThat have very drew up a guy yesterday a guy friday said ... I met a a I kept having\nMy water bill going up and a ... bill going up and it turned out one of his tenants\nWas I hate to use the word drug test and improper thing\nBut she had turned the bath water on it doesn't that returned it off so I mean it's a terrible tease attendance and it ought to know trashing the turnover and ... the terrible tease and we say you know you can trade those terrible team for some terrific to use and it could be to Haiti\nOr it could be a taco in Tijuana those are some time and the killing the grandkids\nRight right and that's most of the folks that are attending our workshops they're not coming there so they can do and it's ten thirty one exchange into another\nApartment building for instance they're usually trying to get out of the intense management uh aspect of it and that's why they're looking at options like the Delaware statutory trust which are you a sit down and go over them with the triple net properties or something that's less management intensive\nAnd some of these ds T properties or or some of the largest real estate owners in the United states\nAt one particular company that comes to mind that bill in ... and Doug you know I won't mention the company but they're out of Chicago uh Dave ... we're starting to fifty years ago by for school teachers who finished school together college together and now they own the largest companies in United States\nThat are putting it in perspective at one time they were the second largest owner a Wal Marts in United States next to the Walton family they are currently the second largest owner of multifamily properties building the state of Colorado so these companies by a property I'm looking at a list of about Seventeen companies we represent\n[noise] they're raising twenty two million forty million Ninety eight million these companies are literally one particular company has a billion dollar line of credit\nThey'll go by for example three apartment buildings below market write a check and they own the property and those properties then can be eligible bill for ten thirty one exchange where people want to be passive they don't want any of those terrible tease and they're able to get cash flow on their equity around five percent\nNow none of this stuff is guaranteed no real estate's guaranteed but if you take a look at the diversification will take a million dollars on the example of we are talking about and this couple of could be in five different apartment buildings located all over the United states professionally manage and giving him around five percent projected on their equity\nAnd typically is around five percent I'm Sorry around fifty percent loan to value so three million dollars of equity will by about six million dollars of a real estate and the six million dollars is what the appreciation is based on the tax benefits but they're getting in come on on five percent of\nA three million dollars that's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year paid mostly automatically and they're checking account so that's another direction people can take absolutely\nI mean it really gets out of all the property management headaches and what you referred to his mailbox management\nAnd Douglas talk and remind our listeners what the topics are\nThat we cover at the workshops abroad topics and you can highlight those 'cause you're the moderator you the guy that\nAh sets the stage and gives the education about or this or certainly the prompt ten and ...

Sorenson from top line moving about a very common myth that I think everybody except the highly educated roofing community has probably bought into\nWhich is that your time is not your tile that is going to go bad if the ... what they call the under lame at the paper the fell to the three am I getting this friend early him and his what the primary Herman proper term\nI'm is what goes bad and that's not actually true it is if there were ... they'll force again so those are those are just joining if it's in Salt correctly what should out\nOf town risk as a system should last forty plus years under lame at flashing tile everything should last that long distance call prompting maintain they regularly\nSo this this um misconception is is very common but the reason it is I think it tell me if I'm wrong here is because the two secrets are have the roof installed correctly on the front end and then have maintained correctly overtime if either of those go wrong is that where where there you're gonna get the failure\n[noise] oh yeah absolutely if water's getting to the underlying but you're going to have a problem with ... I mean there's no doubt about it and again it's got to take five years or so but it's going to where I'm causal link but you prevent that from happening but don't you do have to have been replaced that under lame in that area absolutely but not necessarily ...\nSo I have another question for you Wayne and this is a project you actually looked at for one of my family members were\nThe previous owner had\nA power wash the tile and power wash the finished the ceramic finish off the outside of it because it had a moss on you know that green moss grows ... what does someone do is that a service that you provide or what do you do if you have that growth on your roof\nThat's kind of interesting question because um there's various things they're trying to find out there to ways to eat that off so you don't have to pressure watched because the downside of pressure washing is ... one is you can eat off the paint like you say and number two the fire mental age issues with it because it's very difficult ... requirements because of pressure wash a roof\nI Can't let any water hit that storm dreamer I'm violating federal law so it's very difficult to do that correctly and and then some people don't know how to do it in like say they eat out the paint\nI Wonder if you could just simply put a put water in a little bit of bleach in a pump sprayer and just put a very light spray on top of it was that would\nYeah that's what we're looking for ways like that but the problem with bleach I think is now you got bleach hitting your plants below oh that's a good point there are we're trying to find ways that they can be environmentally friendly way that you can put on the roof that could either way come away in the east coast as they used copper well I don't know if we want to lay copper across ... around here people would complain\nBut that's used on the east coast a lot where they have a lot more moss problems we do\n... I never even thought about that problem but it is that you see that they see that grow up yeah I feel that a lot um so when the uh the saving money element of this I think is is not one to be miss 'em you know not focused on\nPeople are getting the advice you need to have the entire ... ... the underlying redone and that is if that's not the case it was just a spot fix what kind of savings difference could there be a ...\nHuge because it depends what you do on on our ... what's it called lift and really there's various ways you go about it but it could be huge cause a lick repair may cost you know Fifteen hundred dollars and that's your only problem and people are saying well replace your whole route because of that or we do all your underlying that because of that well you know it's a big difference\nBetween those two yeah you're talking about a massive difference in thousands and thousands of dollars and would you rather spend\nFifteen hundred dollars to save your furniture and your furnishings or you know ignore it and\nYou know yeah a lot of people will ignore probably ... until it gets bigger but I think that one of the key things here is if a roofer his told you you need to re re paper re roof reenter lame and a tile system\nYou can judge of the eight because by the ... when they say Twenty years you have to know what the reason that makes no sense to me\nSo I think no matter what the reason a second opinion is a great idea then so if you've gotten some advice that you need to have your roof re paper ... call Wayne", "year": "2018", "show_name": "San Diego Business Saturday", "city": "San Diego", "day": "27"}
