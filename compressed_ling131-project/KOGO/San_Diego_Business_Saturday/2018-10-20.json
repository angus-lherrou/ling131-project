important thing to keep reminding people about it\nBefore the break we were talking about the funniest thing people get to do every year would just pay the high summer utility bills right I look forward to throw a party we decorate the tree with you know with light switches and not just getting um but it's the worst time of year for a lot of people paying those bills and were talked about HVAC\nSystems being such a drain on a on the electricity and we started to say that the new ones work differently and you said on or off the old way the new way is what\nThe variable speech technology which I kind of relate to 'em cruise control in a car being my house my thermostat that's on my phone\nUh I set it to never let it get below sixty seven never above Seventy one degrees and it's just a that attempt sure that my house pertains and I let my system do what it needs to do to keep that and then I've got my solar panels on my roof that pay for that um but without newer technology of a very modest sized solar system\nThat allows me to you know pay pay that ten dollar months minimum to um to as teaching and that's it\nSo what are your whole author so you keep your health the temperature of a meat locker\nBaby Noah's going after they've ever you out your wife she's become acclimated basically the ... from Batman either I I I'm a it was the thing when it was the ... the frost guy Mr free free that Mr ... from from from Batman\nBut you have how much do you pay a month to se Jeannie ten bucks ten bucks and your solar system you've had for a while now paid off\nBy it yeah it's it's I was going to hit a three and a half year return on investment on on pretty much at that point right now\n... that's that's just amazing it was awesome so you keep your house the temperature of any lockers Mr Freeze for free basically correct\nThat I I don't know how people that don't go with this why they continue to suffer the way that they do it just doesn't make sense especially when your team it up because the the the a PAC system it doesn't have to be a huge system or after the sources knows after the system to power these new insurance nice us right\nCorrect so you know we kind of take a different approach to which is what can I Do to reduce the houses energy consumption before I put solar on it because with everything going electronic cars you know everything that if I just lit or your roof with solar panels and then you add something else that uses more\nI'm stuck right I Can't do anything to help you there\nBecause the the other thing is you don't have to do the most ultra sufficient HVAC system either if you're doing solar if it's all designed at the same\nTime right yeah we'll try to partner those two things together to make sure that they they fit each other and are tied into each other\nSo it makes a lot of sense if you if you're going to do solar and you have an old HVAC system to do both of those together yeah cause typically\nYou can get one investment to pay for the other which is\nInstead of doing a large solar system you do it more small smaller solar system which is in cheaper to purchase and you fit in\nA new hearing an air system with that and ended up at the same net cost and your dad panels to right in the future you can and you know that's kind of what we're thinking is that this is not really going to stop I don't think solar is the thing that's going away is becoming more popular as the years go by\nI Would hope so yeah this is the rest of the future there's no way we're not going to continue to you know there were some political debate that we're not going to get into but you know there's a limited supply of dinosaurs to burn\nI'm the son is not a limited supply will and billions of years worth of this but I'm In something that that political arguments aside saves money and everybody likes that part\nYeah everybody likes to do their part for the green of the planet but mostly working with the green and their wallet you know right when we take care of that\n... that's where we're most people are looking at and you make this process really easy to cause I think one of the reasons people don't go with solar and and suffer with an old age bases of some of those high bills\nIs because the fear of the unknown or fear of someone coming in and misleading them about what kind of a system to get or what to do\nIs that hesitancy to move the is that where you find most people's yeah just kind of\nThe like I'm the opposite of like a gambler right then I tell you when they when my team but homeowners now are kind of just hearing the horror stories from somebody else who had a bad experience and it kind of bribes and the wrong way and they're nervous about going to happen to them\nThat I Do think homeowners need to do their homework and and look at the options because there are a lot I mean I see every day on jobs that when we do re models and we see solar installed by not reputable companies\nAs the roofs that are really messed up that they're not repaired ride or replace um panels that should've been upgraded a lot of things happen when they're not done right\nI think that's if you hit on a key and it tells you tell me if I'm wrong with this but there was a kind of a boom in solar for a period of time there were still is so popular but ... years ago it was you know it was Bob's bar and grill and solar right everybody was doing Silverlake crack the up and a lot of companies that didn't have any business doing it we are doing it\nIt's in chicken companies out we have done the screening and vetting process laws even with us since basically day one we don't get complaints we never had anybody or in in my experience ever come back and say they had anything but the but a stellar experience with with money\nI appreciate that and we work hard to make sure that people are happy and give them value in in what they're purchasing well you have a legacy I mean papa in the ... I got you know there's some weight on my shoulders to carry kind of on when people decided to retire and move on but you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "San Diego Business Saturday", "city": "San Diego", "day": "20"}
