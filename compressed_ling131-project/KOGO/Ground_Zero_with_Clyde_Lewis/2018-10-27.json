that well if it does come here I think it'll happen first that UCSD they've got the technology of the GOP nowadays and I think that would be one I think\nMore likely people will be introduced to the

other stories they deserve\nYour attention or but don't always get the airtime but they should yeah what else that we and the others stand\nOkay am I on yeah this is on okay okay\nAll right thank God it's gee alright [laughter] okay so are the push them banned plastic straws has been embraced by many countries in Europe and here in the U.S companies like Disney and Starbucks or doing the same\nDisease looking to get rid of single use plastic straws and ... and all of its locations by mid twenties Nineteen Starbucks\nIs transitioning from a new live for cold drinks that looks like an adult ... then you got celebrities\nWay they are getting rid of those the the lives for the for the cold drinks yes yeah and the plastic that's good that's good\nAnd uh you have the celebrities who are hatched tacking or who are using the hash tag stop sucking Chelsea Clinton Neil DeGrasse Tyson hold on now let's not go crazy [laughter] Neil DeGrasse Tyson Russell Crowe and Tom Brady they've all pledge to just say no one handed a plastic straw now the big\nDeal is in a disposable plastics draw rank as Tom Brady is still going to use a Gatorade straw\nIt but it isn't\nThat a plastic strong it is a plastic job is not a disposable one is a reusable one oh okay All right well I'm guessing they mean like the disposable I'm sure he put it on his ... what he believes what he's doing so but the thing is that plastic is not\nA biodegradable right and then it doesn't break down and the you know and make and\nBut he can be easily re used and recycled large plastics will over time degrading the small particles but uh it's when they break it down to Michael ... plastics those are\nPotentially carcinogenic and they also track harmful pollutants and they stick around forever and I\nFor myself I'm part of that crew like near the grass Tyson or ... ... where I go to a place like a fast food place and they ... they don't need it\n[noise] I think they should push the carcinogen angle more\nBecause when you start saying or they're not biodegradable there there are polluting there hopefully environment all of a sudden people start getting into oh you're oh you're a hippie do liberal\nAnd search turning into environmental is versus ... editor you know big oil versus big environment I stuff off either I invite you and anyone else\nTo go to a landfill\nOne no one to go to a landfill you will get a visual perspective that will put all this into a nice uh yeah but they're nice box\nPeople don't want to do that because it might violate what they have in their minds as reality well it doesn't matter the lawyer anything that conflict with their reality I mean entire valleys\nAre being used as they've been\nDrawn out and they say okay this is going to be a landfill I mean I remember right and then it's kept turned into a golf course right\nBut just just the notion of just seeing this huge valley the huge place and then seeing dump trucks look by local just dumping just\nLoads of trash am down people don't care if you tell them that it's going to give them cancer all of a sudden they care 'cause nobody nobody wants to get cancer\nWell OK then I'm I'm much more philosophical about the whole thing then because it was it his mind blowing to me is the entire tracks of land just filled with trash\nYeah I don't blame me saying you know I think that's I think you're right but I don't think that's going to change the minds of the masses\n... it's like a smoking smoking didn't nobody was gonna say oh I Can't believe there's so much litter with all these cigarette butts that are out there oh\nThe the smoke is a or the ashes are all over my my restaurant table no you know hey smoke is going to give you cancer look at this guy he was hacking up his long every morning ... says the same mindset when a woman is attacked don't call for help call say it's fire yeah\nNow and go oh exact note affects me three seconds cocoa and I'd have a great weekend we have the mid\nTerm elections around the corner of the New York times is starting to hedge their bets they are preparing liberals for possible let down\nOn Tuesday and time headline asked what couldn't hold back a Democrat blue wave\nAnd then he listed a bunch of sober reality checks that might help Republicans reduced their losses or maybe even keep their house majority\nNow the biggest sober reality to New York times whose life is pretty darn good out there and fly over country the unemployment numbers the lowest in fifty years consumer confidence is spilling over says the times for both businesses and consumers the economy is growing faster than it has in years\nAnd you would think they would be celebrating you'd think they'd be happy about it but to the New York times and Democrats are great economy as a sober reality ... problem on top of that\nFrom the company that made it that was a W ... company and they sent a letter along with it with the board and sent it to 'em they'll set of copy that letter to the to the Boston Globe so it was published on but also the president sent a letter back and he wrote back and basically thank them for the which board\nAnd he said it was you know really made it was it was made out of great ingenuity\nBut he said that he will hardly think I shall neatly test its power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also it's in the United states only but it was an Eighteen Ninety the ... board that we know today I got to start\nAn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen to Canada bought some rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the ... board and so they started making boards in Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the ... makes it a prominent flash into\nThe market I mean ... everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moving with going\nBig time and I so much what's going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark pants or the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's a good it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you ... or ... own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards\nRelease in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make their own and start customized and selling them but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of\nThis story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case I'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted\nA legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did he tricked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\nWell which is kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy who used to work for current affair which is an old TV show or on the which has only channel five or something right in the east\nAnd um he was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board and he worked on hated like um the show he did like producing I think mhm\nCurrent affairs and then he was the one who introduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games of things and they took it to another level I think it's the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYeah and the and the background to write the background history\nYeah and they were told and everything you know and they put it down to they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but I'm the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know not to and I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old\nBecause this is real this is really happen this really works and it's a very scary and if you if you have the wrong intentions\nAnd you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to send them back\nTo always say there's not a joke ...\nNo I'm a ... and I want to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time let's be honest with you to board a gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a a crystal glass so they use I mean you know boards can rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights\nSo that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need ports do we care and I mean even the boards of bear or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into being able to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own six since ... he started developing really started really being fined tune\nAnd taken aboard a way I can still do this work and be a lot of people ... and the old days these typewriters word processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way that's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement\nMovement itself that kind of opens up the receptor so you could start bringing in the information and so again I Want to be real clear the board there's no negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen unless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that's my desire or that's how I view the world so\nPeople doesn't mean you know people are scared us even talking about this on the radio or I have\nAre though they they they bring in the they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and I\nDon't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and then it's eighty or motor responses are that are based basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions and the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters\nAnd so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip in a way to to view I mean people would use pencil that I I used to know a medium that would ah would he would do his thing he would just scribble you would take hensel\nAnd he would just scribble on a new bad and he just scribbling scribbling as he scribbling for some reason they just doing the scribble he's looking at going all I see a scribbling but what I said what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of doing something with his hand Louis mind was bringing in the information primaries getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are using something else\nBut it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the motor response\nBut certainly is a interesting and you see it in an action tonight on grounds that we're talking
