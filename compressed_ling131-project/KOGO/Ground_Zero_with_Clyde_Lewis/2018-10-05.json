at least one question where everyone's trying to have fun with I think [noise] two percent said the Cold War was caused by climate change of\n... it's that group of people who just want to mess with the test just because they feel like they can so that's who I think those people are fed up with the foundation\nPut out this uh put up their stand with regards to results and they said was voters heading to the polls next month uninformed engaged citizenry is essential unfortunately this study found the average American\nThere'll be ... uninformed regarding America's history Andy and capable of passing the U.S citizenship test it would be an error to view these findings as merely an embarrassment\nKnowledge of the history of our country is fundamental to maintaining a democratic society which is in Harold today\nRather a dramatic statement from those guys\nIt really does make me nervous though because the ideas that we have that formulated the\nYou know the Democratic republic that we have their net new ideas they were just combined this way for the first time you know the the Romans had the Senate and the others have had constitutions I mean a lot of ours is based on the magna ... so there's there are a lot of other\nYou know a historical influences and we don't know any of that we don't know what made them saying why is it so important to have a free press for instance you know why why do we need to have something in there that says you can protect somebody who's right to petition\nOr in fact I'd be interested in finding out how many people might citizenship citizenship tests gives me a could tell you what the right to petition means\nUh I I think that they would probably not get that correct or many of them no no no\nI think they would be I think there will be better off trying to figure out the ah the ah power codes to Fortnite characters then [laughter] to figure out exactly what this is you know that's the only other thing\nToo is that we always project to some of the younger generations but I'm not sure that that's the case\nYou know I worked for some people that that I look at and I go how did you get this far like how did you make it this far you're still alive Brian how possible how did you not accidentally die taking your Sylvia ... herself in front of a train because [laughter]\nThey're portraying leaves from behind be traveling at Seventy miles an hour and I'm taking a filthy owned by phone at eight mega pixel how far my arms and legs gonna fly part\nI mean this is what we run you know and you see I I think\nIt's it's a matter of caring and you just basically have to care and so therefore I ask people why don't they care and there is a lot\nOf ah of ah not while there's animosity but the apathy yeah a lot of apathy in a lot of places and I think this is a reflection of that but regardless of apathy you got at least know what's going on you guys have a situational awareness of yourself oh what's going on around you\nOf the world and especially politics because if you know then when you're forced to make a decision or postal forced them not first of all but when you make of oh you're\nYou're you're\nDoing everybody a disservice because you don't know everything you need to know in order to make that decision\nYeah well you know if there's an upset that we read into this is that we have a number of people who are content and don't feel that they need to spend time caring about those things so um we must be doing okay\nYou know even though we lament the people who are dumb they can be dumb because\nFor block shame singularity that the computer that it's going to take over the money the beef system six six six all of unfair\nAnd there are certainly people all over the world right now they would rather rural for other reasons you know and maybe it's just that I've been watching too much American horror story apocalypse but my dad that God and you watch that\nThat's a lesson in in the fight between what is the dark powers and whether a power is out there in the midst of an apocalypse\nPredicted programming revelation of the matter if it\nWould be increasing globally ... a globalization of political and economic institutions it's becoming easier for a relatively small group\nTo deceive itself into quite staggeringly influential positions and one couple in particular reveals alarmingly what another small group will do is driven by financial belief systems and a cult things and all the things in the shadows all the things that can reach out and grab you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there are many conspiracy writers and observers that tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate that has control over the world\nSpiritual realm\nBut what is it the thriving right now in the midst of globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex things that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back\nAnd read and understand that's why I come in every day early and\nYeah you can go through all of the bad guys the masons the jazz or with accusing them of controlling all the spiritual rounds of what appears to be the same material called however it becomes more complicated\n\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or priest craft that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it\nBecause of what I've studied my my entire life what I what I put into this program every night every major step in the development of the new world order from a simple ideology to a worldwide super states can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards disorder and it can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality that professes to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\n\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I use the the the word synergy\nThere was a guy by the name of a Joseph ... say knives\nAnd he had an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is pre destined to rule absolutely at odds with the event emerging concepts of democracy and so\nHe decided that the only way to win and to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so he wanted\nTo transmit the secret synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual bothers us that are key were of course the knights Templar\n\nAnd other groups that you know actually spawned and and and new ideas and and\nMysterious mysterious subjects and\nHidden meanings and certain\nConjure rings and all of these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark state or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker type of rule\nOf dark command that actually\nThe darker powers to create as sin arcade may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into towel but what it is it is a government of some kind of group a conspiracy of men or women that form a priest to it and are ruled by a secret society open societies are not always the ones\nThat are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing\nTheir power plays within the United states and within the world the formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all conspiracies but from there there were other conspiracy groups other secret societies\nAnd I know many Christians in America I Believe that the establishment or the United states was based on Christian values and ideologies business half true\nBecause the rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely ... Indian bordered on things like her medic arcane them announced it says I'm so from the very beginning we've always had that group\n\nThat are simply observers they they they are custodians and they make things happen\n\nAnd they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\nTo the apostles to the disciples to those who've adopted the views of Christianity Islam and Judaism and they're against the general teaching of any gospel whatsoever any word there would be connected to a God\nA God that they don't approve of\n\nAnd they are on the opinion that the dog was if any gospel are not good for anyone\n\nAnd this is why the ruling oligarchy in most respects has a secret doctrine which is reserved for the elite\nAnd this is why when you see things happen that don't sincerely seem\nGodly or or Chrysler like or or or anything you you look at the symbolic language you look at the actions you look at the numbers and all the numbers in the symbolic actions in the language and all of them are puzzle pieces to a greater picture and not always do you have the greater picture and even I
