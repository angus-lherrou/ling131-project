barred could be of animals could be something doesn't fit in with a big block that issue for Congress stories dumping\nBarbie NATO on the program something if something is invested her infested or homes you know what it is she wondered if it was some sort of demonic\nThing one of them some sort of a ... an alien thing wondering if it's something that she doesn't understand but we do have inspectors literal inspectors that are going to go to our house and inspect this way she doesn't have to pay out any more money to find out something that she doesn't already know or what have you but we have them we're going to be arranged you would get them to her\nAnd uh that we will get a logical scientific explanation now that doesn't hold where to go further we're going to uh probably some goes to the theaters or maybe in some other investigators treatment I'll just go and if there's something demonic going on there\nUh but uh you know one of the things that we do on this program and we've done it many times is that we actually have to vet the stories about the thing with Barbie he is but she came to a news press conference\nOkay and we were at a news ... press conference in Oregon or some of the tour went to Seattle and beyond she came to the press conference to ask the news department\nWhat could be done about the home and ... how it could be inspected so it was not\nBut she had me she asked me if I knew anything about it there was something paranormal about it I was at bat I thought I don't know what George my audience and find out of the biggest paranormal or not\nAnd so this is why I brought Barbie on the show this is not\nTo try and convince you something paranormal this was an investigation and process now\nUh it's also I thought appropriate for Halloween to talk about this the reason why is because I don't know about you but creepy crawly crap coming out of a house whether it be spiders or any other bugs or or whether it be rats mice or anything else aren't terribly creepy\nThey are terribly creepy and a and this is why I uh this is why I wanted to talk about this tonight\nSo uh if anyone you know if anyone has had this happen to them or something that they can claim that they've had happened to them I'd like to hear the story because you know things that are out of the ordinary things are anomalous\nOr certainly worthy you're talking about especially run Halloween and so I said the chauffeur around this time because I wanted people you know because it's all part of Halloween right the creepy crawly feed the spider things going down up and to the ads crazy but there are these are things that happened\nAnd uh but I'm going to talk to ... this is something that's really a B ordinary Jason calling you from California how
