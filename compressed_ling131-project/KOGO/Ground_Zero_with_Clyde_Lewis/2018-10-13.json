I Love Italy\nAnd I was in Rome and when I Would sit down for a meal\nIt was a enjoyable process because it it was literally four or five courses\nAnd it takes about an hour and a half between courses because they don't have the the meal already cooked and ready for you to go when you're done with the first one you will wait until the first one is done and then they strictly in the second one point you have to wait for a table number long\n'cause it's not like you're hurry up I mean you're you're there\nRight right right and but you know you go to another story down the way of the you know if it's too busy or whatever but but the point is I was talking to some chefs over there and says yeah they say American food is great but you people over there just eat too much too quickly\nYou're not going to [laughter] to enjoy the process of enjoying the meal and uh he invents\nOf the meal right right yeah but but there's also\nThe notion of portion control because I've seen people sit down and open up a bag go in and out and it's\nToo burgers to fries and and it is in ... and ... minutes later it's coming out and shake and everything and\nIt's I don't know that's the way of ah celebrating the fact that they're in America\nBut it's there's I think there's some theme mentally and emotionally disconnect between people on food and I can attest to that 'cause I was once every hundred and thirty pounds and I point I'm looking back up there\nI'm I'm replaying the stuff that I ate when I was a kid I had no portion control I had no amount could I ate what ever I Want it as much as I wanted whenever I Want and it wasn't until I got older and we're going no stop\nUp yeah I feel you meant the same thing when I was in high schools latchkey when I was in high school and we get we got home my brother and I we would easily put down with those Tony's personal pizzas and that was done uh those banquet pot pies that are about nine hundred calories a pop three of those was a snack before dinner\nOh no I'll for what what is it those ice cream things they were half gallon yeah gone gone in an hour followed by orange juice\nWell I mean obviously you have to make a float in your belly [noise]\nIs that I buy that you do that but there is there I think the problem lies not just on the uh the calorie count the forces I there was an emotional consideration that needs to be fixed before any of this gets that\nAnd feeling very emotional about the weekend [noise]\nMy friend and I'm going to set you free [noise]\nMonday we're going to tell you why your neighbors think you're
