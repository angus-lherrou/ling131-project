I Want to know about wellness handle weight watchers is now known as only as WW\n[laughter] two thirds of the Internet [laughter]\nBut but yeah I mean that that's what's going on because once upon a time you could say that you know gee made light bulbs or Chevy made cars or\nAmazon sells things ourself things yeah\nBut now it's the notion is no longer brand 'cause the brand means one thing a brand lifestyle that something else okay but what about BMW right when you think of them do the what do you think of\nPie in vehicles right a high end vehicles that the women you don't know will automatically come up to you and talk to you\nCan go now what have you told them I've got a BMW in the garage but you actually met a jet engine\nOnly oh they make jet engines\nSort of gee that's true yes and Rolls Royce yeah nobody really thinks about that stuff right somehow\nBut very ... it's actually something different but whatever\nWe don't really I guess what we just thinking motors I guess

like gravy original recipe Celtic said let's go to a night\nOn believable pond believable or\nIn their efforts to keep judge capital off the Supreme Court liberal Democrats have sunk to a new low in liberal America particularly among elected Democrats and our drive by media allies\nIt's perfectly fine to smear a distinguished nominate our highest court with uncorroborated on provable and absurd allegations from a lawyer\nJudge Kavanaugh spent a lifetime serving in this country without a blemish on his record or his good name\nBut in the space of Fort teen gays he and his family have seen that lifetime record of exemplary service spat on courtesy of today's Democratic Party\nAnd even now they're on apologetic they have no shame they have no remorse for what they have on a leash on judge Kavanaugh Dr ... for the confirmation process\nShane smart cities that the UN is talked about the idea of having a smart city a smart grid at a smart city police force\nAll working for the green economy right and the smart city sounds like a a digital utopian of course they're pitching a degeneration ... cities for Generation Z\nWould be a smart city is a place where data eliminates first world hassles dangers and injustices that's where they're claiming but there are problems it's eastern cities are are based\nPrimarily on data old data if you want data unique sensors it's not like roads buildings with street lights are just going to wake up magically it started chatting about the weather no we need\nSensors to see here spelled tasting feel on to be happy with these machines we\nNeed sensors to tell us when the bridge needs to be repaired we need sensors to tell us give a damn it's gonna break we need sensors\nTo remind us or do ... that may be a blood is about to happen on earthquakes are about ... anything that can be thrown in is\nIs there any data information they can get they'll have to do it by using sensors\n\nSensors measure temperature traffic patterns foot traffic air quality\nInfrastructure integrity just go down the list of things that these data sensors are supposed to give us well Lux research and innovation researching advisory firm filed report that suggested the world will have to deploy one trillion sensors by twenty twenty in order to fit\nThe criteria for the UN's edict on smart cities and smart city networks shows redesigned smart cities around the data we want instead of the wiring we have\nThis is where it gets more complex because mass data aggregation will establish\nA lot of truth about how our cities are being run it's going to lead us to a social credit score for you or me and everyone else and a social credit score\nOn the quality of life metrics that each city will have\nSo let's say you want to make a choice on where you want to move your family you could look at a smart city or the smart city metrics guide based on a number based on social credit based on what kind of people live there for the social credit scores are extremely low in a part of a different part of the country people don't want to associate with people with a low credit scores\n\nAnd so we're going to create you know where to move everybody in the city and then we're gonna have to figure out which cities are the best in the most desirable by behavioral by behavior data data by a way of life data or the quality of life data okay so we're going to sign these smart seems to be perfect and then the aggregation\nWill be reviewed and we'll be adhered to and it's going to lead us to score cities is the latest to score people or you know it'd be like one big Yelp fast have you ever been to Yelp you know you can destroy your business by giving a business is a bad review on Yelp\nIf you get enough people to rally around the the basically a you know a right some bad stuff about a business you do that on Yelp yeah kills a business right there and there are businesses that have sued to get yelled\nTo remove certain things because people look at that and they go oh well a magic and that being you twenty four hours a day I imagine that being your city twenty four hours a day but how are we going to drop one trillion sensors\nBy twenty twenty\nOkay that means we have to drop a trillion at once we can do and we can't drop you know ... cents\nOr a year or even a million ... a year or once a year you you can't do that right so it can be difficult to meet that by twenty twenty so how do we do is how do we how do they get the problem with the smart city taken care of\nWell we do it with dust\nWe'd do as smart as we do it would then of particles we get I mean look I was discussing this to the ground zero around and said this is the future\nThis is the Internet of things is is your city this was robo sex is everything and they say there's a glut of news about this tech stuff what was interesting it was a lot of it\nThey have to talk about the smart cities and how you weren't smart city away too with all the moves by the FCC and other authorities you're going to find a new development of five genes fell networks that'll all be mandatory in standard\n\nComing up on the third of October they're going to do that test with your phone you know why because they want to figure out if they can do this for the phone systems your phone system is going to be part of the ...\n\nBan opt gun is like a prison where everything is seen from all angles it's like big TV screens actually remembering Batman\nMovie Batman where Batman had that whole thing of screens\nMorgan Freeman says I'll never do this again I'm going to destroy it all or Alford says I Can't remember what was I think it was even Morgan Freeman or Alfred set at ... Morgan Freeman just shows up all the time and whenever he shows up you're going I Will pay attention to Morgan Freeman whatever he says I won't pay attention Morgan Freeman says that will not allow this to go on anymore\nThe only one time you're going to use all of these cell phones and all of this data to find one man to find the joker\nNow that's basically it except they're not going to be using cell phones and they were using nano particles nanotech\nLocal governments are no longer allowed to restrict the deployment of these wireless infrastructure sites in fact they're being pressured to get their projects figured out an budgeted and underway within sixty to Ninety Days for consideration for applications to small cells and\nThat's pretty much taking away right now\n\nWe move is critical for deployment of five gee wireless communications his wireless signals for twenty four and twenty\n... fans\nAre very short and significant limits to disease or localities and all of this so this means in some cases in all cases the next generation of high speed wireless Internet is a giveaway to judge Judy telecommunications companies that will eventually strip\nGovernment of local

leader because he really is he's he's a\n... ... is a world leader he leaves the world with these little social media\nSo he is actually just as powerful\nIf not more powerful than the president and a lot of respects\nMe doesn't control or maintain armies and he doesn't\nOrder the deaths of people are nor does the order armies to go to war but he certainly can make life hell for any government who wants to somehow get involved with a social media practices censorship that's why Google kissing China's asked right now is really appalling in my opinion would drag and fly\n\nI mean why is up you know I I don't think people see the big picture here you make deals with a country that treats people like garbage you you you make deals with a with a country that wipes out four thousand Web sites because there are comfortable about what ... ...\nWho who who ah schools should be ashamed of himself\nGoogle should be ashamed and they shouldn't be shame they have a monopoly on search engines on the Internet right now they should be ashamed of themselves for what they're doing\n\nWhere where did you get time word is important to have dialogue but what exactly it means to be a human in a technological world how humanity and machines don't have to be opposed to one another we have to work with machines and knowledge that they are flawed justice we are\nAnd there were people and and then we have a place to control we take control back to back up the human taking control as we keep pushing forward through the new century\nAnd the new millennium it's becoming more parent but the human touch with the human role of things has been sidelined\n\nYou're not going to be able to put one trillion sensors over any place on this planet unless you drop\nDust Julian Assange said so
