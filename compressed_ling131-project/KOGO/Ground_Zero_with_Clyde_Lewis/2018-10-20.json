here I got a whole three minutes to do this one so here we go hurricanes tornadoes dust storms virtually every type of a natural event give some sort of a heads up before it happens except for\n... well a new system will be central doubt that will warn people have an impending quake the rollout of the U.S Geological Survey is earthquake early warning system is a crowning achievement for California Thanks to today's communication system\nThose earth those electronic waves move much faster than the shaking waves from a quake so by installing a system of sensors depending on where the quake we begin\nWith sensors could trigger an alert that would give you a few seconds to pair and now we talked about this a few weeks ago that's enough to get away from the knives in the kitchen All right yeah\nAnd that and then I thought about it yes four or five seconds which in radio terms if it were complete silence that's an eternity [laughter] but um you know those really do come in handy

or brown outs or whatever people would be stuck in elevators for hours\nAnd if the power goes out in a particular because the quake people we stuck in elevators for hours sure\nAnd so I'm thinking okay a few seconds would help with that and so you expand that to say like the rails like the trolley system or or hospitals or there's even one system designed to automatically open lock gates had a condominium garage before the shaking her eyes so that power outage ... motors inside\nYou know where it would come in handy when it comes to elevators and things things of that nature is that if you're about to get on one you know if that alert goes all the see your phone buses and you know you've got four seconds\nYou don't step on the elevator you know that's where I think there's gonna be a lot of like if you're already on the elevator you're trapped anyway but it will stop you from getting on the elevator and then the doors closing and then you're stuck or stop you from getting on the
