others other stories that deserve your attention but don't always get the airtime but they probably should ... brings to us the others you know what else is going on here and you're a stack of the other Sarah continuing\nOn with our theme of oh why bother 'em\nHere's another reason to live coke is ... ... is\nConsumed type one hundred and twenty nine years old or a her ... she was born June first Eighteen eighty nine wow right she's still very lucid and gift\nThe interviews king and\nCoke who says her long life is a punishment from God Oh yes\nShe remembers all one happy day in her life when she returned home after surviving a spelling Persian World War two national polls no no she recalls when living in church and the people that were deported\nBy stone to ... and she says the only happy\nDay and all over years when she returned entered a home built from our own hands\nBack in her late native land\nOh it was the only happy day in her entire life yes\nHappy days here again\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that were already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state\nWhich is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined I had to find out this worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together a green the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this quarter and wants to take over to go to Jackie in California hijacked during ground zero\n[noise] so I applied yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things that just didn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\nLike I had known to show gets ...\n... you\nKnow you had a the Turks came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is ah between a rock and a hard spot now\nBecause you're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket\nWould have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide beads stay manipulation heat is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWould this is this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy or Asian or look at\nThe un other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to Laurel can be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow starts to escalate\nNow how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ...\nIs the Saudi citizens and he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states as a consequence the president United States has really no authority\nTo retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watched him get pressured to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know you know the turkey has said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and the flu is remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh the gloom out of the country\nFlight if the Turkish government had a video evidence of this team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it team\nProbably do the same reason uh you said that he was in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can't get in there and the embassy and do anything about it\nWell but we're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey may be arguments the CIA was facilitating operation deep laid off in the argument that he said operatives in the high a\nScore facilitators to the murder of is a good show gay\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian or a B C D operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too\nBut what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more can be gives a tremendous pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you wouldn't want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing that I have a feeling we do need to do that well I have a feeling though that's\nWhat they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you got bowl and who certainly it was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved them into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply and the seventies\nAnd we had an immediate gasoline shortage there were long lines for gasoline yup and they went to the odd even license plate right so you can get a a one day if you play it was even in the next day if you play it was an even on that I think they went by the last number of your plate\nSo I mean number I was working in the motion picture business at the time\nTo help a turkey get back in that race it we'll see what happens here we'll see what happens right now I I look don't it doesn't look too good Peter Jennings appreciate the call ... they get Tripoli victim at three thirty seven hundred will be back\nWhere mine\nAnd\n\n\n\nMy heart radio is big easy to use that for music and re\nDownload the free I hard radiolab today\nThis audio is for your review can offer ...
