predicted programming from Nineteen forty five allegedly okay and predicted programming the revelation of method is everything that goes into fringe analytics and why things happen the way they do what they are it's reverse causality or something else and\nThe other night I was watching a movie called tomorrow land it was uh in my free movies been and I remember it being a good movie I wanted to see it again and what was interesting about it was it reminded me\nOf well\nA secret society in the film officials secret society called plus ultra and a lot of people who are involved with plus all trolleys visionaries Thomas Edison and H. G. wells and\nUh several other people Thomas Edison Mark Twain all having connections in fact they said that even does be was a member of this plus ultra group\nAnd I thought well that sounds really believable is plus ultra real well\nYes and no okay cause I'm finding out that maybe it's not called plus ultra but it's something else even does be was a part of something called club thirty three that he created it was just a special club for some of the people he knew and some very special people and of course\nA lot of people believe that the ... thirty three comes from the thirty three degrees and masonry because this was part of the Malay when he was a kid so\nPlus ultra\nIs there any truth to the idea that maybe plus ultra may be\nSome time travel group for some group it created a a breakaway civilization on some other\nPlane a utopian plane well H. G. wells are as you know there was a movie made about H. G. wells called time after time it was another fictional movie where wells goes into the future to find Jack the ripper and he does so by using his quote fabled time machine\nAnd the movie and it's kind of ... cryptic late says H. G. wells married Amy Catherine Robbins who\nDied in Nineteen twenty seven minutes as as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel\nAnd women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells also claimed that he was a Fabian socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new world order now he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order would happen but he knew that a new world order was in the works that he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or a utopia that basically emanates from a global government there was a ... medical leader that led them and the whole nine yards well prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War started in Nineteen forty\nOr the world will be brought into a new world order by criminal dictator who ... the war machine and so that actually approximate in what really happened in World War two\nWell then he wrote and several of his books that that there was a shadow government there was looming that this shadow government was there to create a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing it kind of like what Benjamin Israeli said about the British Government and well well you know he was a visionary we notice and whether\nOr not he was a time travel is anyone's guess I don't know if you ... ... but ... but he according to this movie it was part of the plus ultra program now Nikola Tesla\nIs also one of the guys that was in this program this plus ultra program allegedly in the in the Disney movie and of course his inventions went beyond electricity in fact there were some people who believe that he created a time machine but he was the I guess the American equivalent of H. G. wells at the time\nWell by the time of his death he had patented ... about seven hundred things but after he died in Nineteen forty three\nAll of his possessions were seized by a government office called the government offices of alien property\nAnd about three weeks after they were seized all Tesla's things in documents were given a thorough examination by group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump who was the uncle of Donald Trump our president but what's interesting is that you know John Gee Trump said that Nikola Tesla's papers were really amounted to nothing but\nA Trump went on to ah actually create X ray machines\nCapital was working extra machines inside but he created them and of course Trump Donald Trump always says well I come from a long light of intellectuals and very a genius says like my uncle John J. Trump John Gee Trump he was a genius as well well\nUm what's interesting about all this is is that\nThe question is what did Donald Trump cynical find those papers in Nineteen forty three\nWell\nThere's a question as to whether or not just had a time machine\nAnd that there was something about that the era of wells the era of Tesla and this this writer who was a science fiction writer his name was Ingersoll lock would unlock wood was the author of a a few books\nOne that raise many eyebrows a couple Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey and another was called Nineteen hundred and then there was the last president or both of the books are in the library of\nCongress and you can read them but Newsweek did this strange article and twenty Seventeen basically saying that\nThis barren Trump character in this book goes to Russia he gets advised by a character named on and then he goes to the Fifth Avenue hotel in New York and then a Fifth Avenue a hotel or whatever it was it was I think probably the Waldo for story if I'm right\nBasically had some significance as well because there there were there was that book by luck would called ah the last president and in the last president\nThere's a quote from the book is really interesting it's about uh the state of uproar in New York after the election of an outsider candidate said that the entire east side this is from the book this is in the Eighteen hundreds by the way uh it says the entire east side is it a state of uproar police officer shot it through the streets warning city folk to stay indoors for the
