Supreme Court confirmation\nOn the larger Senate vote until the FBI investigation is complete it so why is that important well it's one hurdle now Mitch McConnell could have brought this up to the larger body even if the Senate Judiciary committee voted Kevin on down it would have been a bad idea politically but it could have done that\nWhy this is important is because it basically allows her Mitch McConnell to set its own timeline McConnell could start floor debate on this anytime it's come out of committee McConnell now runs the schedule on the floor debate over judge Kavanaugh\nI don't know if McConnell plan for starting for debate before the FBI investigation is complete I'm going to guess that he doesn't simply because it would end up being a floor debate that would focus on we

Kevin a leg to a a buddy up with athletes who was ... ... but one of the other guys who was on the team said no no no I don't remember this guy hanging out with us at all\nOh\nSo now we've got this other he said he said sort of situation going on [noise] well Jeb weddings in this friend of Kavanaugh at least he says he was um wrote that when Brett got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nOn one of those last occasions I purposely excuse me I'm One of the last to gauge the purposely socialize with Brett I witnessed and respond with somebody hostile remark not by diffusing situation but by throwing his beer in a man's face in starting a fight that ended up with our mutual friends in jail\nWell\nYou just said somebody ended up in jail after a bar fight\n\nThese records if somebody ended up in jail there are going to be records\nSo\nThat occasion turned out to be the bar fight capital was involved in in Nineteen eighty five New York times some the police report\nAnd the incident was September Nineteen eighty five during Kavanaugh's junior year\nAt you and [noise]\nAfter you be forty concerts September twenty fifth book\nWhich ironically was banned who's saying about alcohol\nCabinet a group of people went to ... well known bar that serves big\nSlices of pizza and cheap beer especially after nine PM who doesn't have a happy hour when you're in college and my right\nTheir friends were drinking pints at one point they were sitting near a man who they thought resembled alec Campbell the lead singer of you'll be forty [noise]\n[noise] and what was that man

swung at ... at that point [noise] uh Chris took his beer and smashing into the head of the guy who by now had Brett and an embrace and I'm guessing it wasn't a loving one [noise]\n\nAccording to the statement [noise] this is from a police incident report and then tried to pull Chris back and a bunch of other guys tried to pull the other guy back I don't know what Britain was doing in the mail a are but there was blood\nThere was glass there was beer and there was some shouting and the police showed up [noise]\nKevin and four other men being questioned by the New Haven police department Kavanaugh was not arrested by the police report stated that age Twenty one year old man accused cabinet of throwing ice on him for some unknown reason\nThat ain't\nRight and again I I tend to be in agreement with with those people who say that somebody's behavior when they were Eighteen or Twenty one years old shouldn't determine the course of their entire life I Do believe that God was Twenty one gotten a bar fight cares\nWell\nThe the problem is that if he's fifty three and he's interviewing in front of the Senate for one of the the top jobs requires most integrity on earth\nIs lying about it that's where you run into a problem\nAlso want to make one other point because\nWe keep saying that ... somebody does when they're Eighteen or Twenty one shouldn't impede them from success later on in life\nBut is that really true do we really believe that\nIf somebody does something wrong when they're Eighteen years old\nRight steal the car\nGuy and his buddies out there out drinking and they see another guy that was a at the same party that guy's drunk passed on on the lawn and they grabbed his keys and they go for joy ride\nAnd they get caught\nThey get hit with a DUI minors and position\nAs far as time goes actually it's other people trying to piece together when this happened not the specific date but even the year so I Know that's a that's a problem a lot of people have with this entire\nIssue a\nMitchell says that Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the failing by name a saying that what you talked to her husband and then the notes to the therapist she claims that um\n[noise] uh she said that it was it was\nUm someone who's now a federal judge but she didn't say who it was and evidently couldn't remember the name she identified the individual but not by name so she's saying did you really know you're saying it was if you recognize phase meta look up to name\nA we're speaking with her husband doctor for a changing her description of the incident to become less specific\nA Ford told the Washington Post that she told her husband she was a victim of physical abuse whereas now she says why that uh she told her husband about sexual assault and Ford has no memory of key details the night and questioned details that could help corroborate her account among them she does not remember who invited her to the party or how she heard about it she doesn't remember how she got to the party\nSo there are a number of what House the assault allegedly took place in our\nAh what ah where the house was located with any specificity perhaps most importantly she doesn't remember how she got from the party to her house or the mettle than containing a continued listening more details\nAre Mitchell pointing out this from a heavy dot com by the way missile pointing out that for does however remember small mistake details from the party unrelated to the assault for example she does fine so she had exactly one beer at a party\nAnd was taking no medication at the time the alleged assault\nFor the counter the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone\nOr she identified as having attended including her lifelong friend and so that was a little bit Trump or troublesome to Rachel Mitchell regimen show again prosecutor who prosecute sex crimes should not normally the person that does the the interrogation understand\nOf the accuser she's the one representing the accuser but in doing so she has to know what the what the trappings are that a defense attorney might use\nShows is that a doctor for it is not offering consisted accountability attack however she does say that she understands that memories can change and so it's not necessarily disqualifying that she doesn't have that recall\nSeeing Dr Ford also struggled to recall important recent events relating door allegations in her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about her memory and say she may have been influenced in her explanations by\nUh the the people around her congressional Democrats and her attorneys so those are some of the some of the hang ups that\nAre Rachel Mitchell has their legit they are legitimate however I Will say this uh in doing some research about memory and about how it works how our brains work\nOne of the things investigators look for and this this this boggled my mind here but it's
