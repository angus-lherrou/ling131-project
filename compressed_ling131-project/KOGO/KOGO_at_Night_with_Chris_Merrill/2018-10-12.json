this before there were hitching a ride\nAnd so they're taking off and this rocket and it's got to one of the the sewers rockets these are the ... you know the Russian versions of the the launchers that they've been using for for years\nIsn't goes off and it has a malfunction and the second stage it it takes off from the from the capsule itself and they're trying to figure out exactly what happened they think maybe there was to breathe that came off maybe the the release wasn't exactly right whatever it was\nThings didn't go as planned in all of a sudden you started getting all the bells and whistles and you start having all the beeps in the in the ... and things like that and the capsule and mission control said uh this is not good\nSo what they did is they they said we had to bring it back\nThey were concerned that this thing wasn't going to make it it was it was touching go there I can only assume that from mission control it was one of those uh uh what would you call a subdued panic where they sort of\nHeld the panic back while they deal with the emergency in front of them they gave control to the the pilots of the capsule and they said let's get you back\nWell at least you guys had all their training kick in and they're able to bring a capsule out of the sky landed in the mountains in Kazakhstan and walk away from it and heart we really could have been looking at something very very bad and uh\nGood Rick from um the San Diego air and Space Museum and he's the c._e._o. joining us now and and the gyms in a long history of of flight as well as a a vast knowledge of what goes on in the skies gym for me I was thinking oh my goodness you know we're we're on the verge of seeing you know another challenge your type disaster unfold in front of our lives\nWell I I I think certainly that's the way we would always look at these things okay and should by the way yeah because these are these are are always failures that we need to run them to growl we need to find out\nYou know what occurred I think you have to take every one of these very seriously I was a navy fighter pilot and uh you know for Twenty one years and we consider safety to be paramount in everything we did\nItaly a glider it was an airplane that just simply didn't have any power okay 'cause remember it wasn't being operated by the engine right so a U.S but it had many of the characteristics certainly of an airplane so it was easier to control\nIn the case of a a a capsule it's almost like trying to control the plummet\nRight you're just sort of trying to aim yeah that is that accurate\nRight and you and you're not going to hit a target the three by three on the ground [laughter] I was going to hit you know you're going to hit a\nGeneral area and certainly um uh they they they they have a good understanding of where those are and it certainly appears okay from everything that I've looked at okay that that\nWhat was supposed to work did work and so you got to give them a lot of credit for that these two people are alive and that's the real key\nNow of course because they are alive because we were able to manage expectations but we're going to have a wonderful ability of course you know to look at this agency and and make an evaluation of what really caused it okay where the right actions taken they will learn from this\nUm you don't want to learn from these are too many time certainly\n[laughter] a bus\nBut they will learn and that's not a terrible thing as they reconstruct from the minute they said launch them you know a a you know the minus one and counting kind of thing right so so it it you have to you have to give everybody certainly at this time a lot of credit because they're not that\nI give them a ton of credit because not only are they not dead they were unharmed and like any land and you can walk away from right\nOh no we I live by that [laughter] there are many nights on the aircraft carrier that you were\nJust going you know you're you know you had a a personal relationship with one guy way up and this guy that just says give me one more landing it's really dark out here and the weather doesn't\nLook that good old

end of the shuttle program which have been seven almost eight years ago we had a shuttle program it ran for Thirty years and I can't help but wonder\nIf this is maybe a sign that we ought to take a good look at the taking control of our own space program again our own space exploration program\nAnd I'm curious as to whether or not you think that is a wise use of our tax dollars\nAre because it ain't cheap do does not inexpensive so is this a good time for us to reevaluate\nAnd say look American exceptionalism needs to be on the front page again and we need to be able to say we did something and look we not only did something for ourselves we advanced humanity and we are taking the lead\nOn this scientific exploration\nSo really curious as your feedback on that eight hundred six hundred pogo is eight hundred six hundred Togo and and I recall pretty distinctly when that program came to an end many people were ... dismayed many people\nWere very upset that the space program was was ending\nI Do remember a a coffee of misinformation\nAt that time when the uh the belief was that we were ending NASA\nBut we weren't we didn't and now so we ended the shuttle program is just that the shuttle program it become synonymous for most of us with NASA now within the ranks of NASA they knew the difference between the shuttle program and everything else that the international space administration takes care of\nBut for us we went my goodness are you shutting down NASA no they're not still there was a little piece there was a little piece of a miracle on a I Believe that we all felt was coming to an end\nIn the the\nRecent push that we've had for ... rejuvenation of American exceptionalism\nI Can't help but to wonder how much that our leadership in space programs was one of those feathers in our caps that that we could say that is what America stands for America stands for exploring the final frontier\nAmerica is here to lead the way to lead other nations\nIn realizing dreams that a hundred years ago we never thought were possible consider the history of flight itself\nWe barely been off the ground for more than a hundred years\nAnd in that time we landed on the moon and we've ended our shuttle program in our hitching rides with other countries I I don't think that it's an erroneous evaluation to say that the United states has fallen behind\nWhen it comes to um [noise] I don't want to say falling behind our ... our lead is not as wide as once was when it comes to space exploration now we've got some technology here on the ground\nThat we're working on and we are doing some really amazing things I'm driving home on a fifty to a here over the weekend and I look up in the sky and I and I see this thing my son was with me and he he was he was Seventy says what is that\nShould the United states be spending taxpayer dollars\nTo continue advancing the achievements of American exceptionalism when it comes to space exploration\nRight now we've decided let's save some money and let's work internationally let's hitch a ride with Russia and that didn't go very well today fortunately both people were able to walk away after the U.S rocket\nAh the second stage didn't go as planned and those two pilots took control the capsule and mind you the capsule looks an awful lot like the old Apollo capsules so is this coming down they're taking the the quote unquote flight controls\nBut all they can really do is try to aim that thing in one direction or another and they're moving it nearly seven jeez in a freefall\nThe parachutes go off and everything else as you heard from a gym kid repair from a air and Space Museum everything else is planned\nEight hundred six Enrico go is it a good use of money or are we better off the lead you to spread that
