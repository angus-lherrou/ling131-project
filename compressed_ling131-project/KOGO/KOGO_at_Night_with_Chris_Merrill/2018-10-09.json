be in a whole\nIt's not harassing other people now that's illegal\nYeah you have to show that the other person has been somehow harmed in order for that other person they're standing but\nIt's illegal harassed somebody the idea that it's biased motivated harassment when was the last time somebody was harassed that it wasn't because of some sort of bias now in this case it evidently is language bias and I'm guessing you're probably some racial bias going on here too but\nUm when I say that there was this is this is like a\nA you've got the be ex girlfriend is now harassing the new girlfriend right he's my man you'll leave him alone oh yeah that's bias because she believes that he is not\nA for somebody else debate so she's ... she's bias against you 'cause you're dating or ex period done

like finding out that no you don't get to harass somebody simply because they're not speaking the same language that you are or that you would for for them to speak\nAs work that way not at all\n[noise] English is considered a Germanic language we just talk a little bit about how it evolved from the Anglo Saxons which were dramatic tribes\nLargely you had the influence of the Latin groups meeting of a different um French which is somewhat intriguing is so many of those are romance languages you had the romantic versus the dramatic language\nInitially English was a dramatic language it sort of incorporated other characteristics\nFrom French and Spanish and Italian\nWhich is why if you take a look back throughout history you'll notice that the English language has changed changed significantly over the class the the the course of the last two hundred years three hundred years five hundred years Shakespeare's English was not the king's English that we saw in the constitution\nAnd the English from the constitution is certainly not what we speak today\nAnd what we have two hundred years from now will certainly not be reflective of what today is but you already
