that's the primary focus of their relationship right back to not even the primary focus is just a larger factor as you get older it's not as big a factor any longer but for some reason that's where

know if you've heard some of these nightmares of of people\nThe contracts are insane not just the dating contract with the contracts have things like ... maybe you've heard that the nightmare stories about um American Idol\nWe've got contestants that basically sign up to do these tours\nAre Afro American idol is over so you've got people that just want American Idol they're working at a record deal and American Idol gets a cut of the deal plus these people have to headline the American idol tours all this other stuff whereas their careers American Idol is supposed to launch their careers careers actually kind of slow way down because they are strapped\nTo uh they're strapped to the the the launch pad\nBut people are signing up they sign these contracts 'cause they do want to have to do before they go on set they want the chance to get their hands on a contract with the season two of bachelor paradise\nAnd we can test and sign up for paradise it required participants to acknowledge that the show can reveal information\nOf a personal private intimate surprising defamatory disparaging embarrassing\nOr unfavorable nature that may be\nFactual and or fictional in other words you have to sign that they can make up a total of back story about you that could be totally ... defamatory totally disparaging and totally fabricated they could do that that's in the contract\nSuch depictions contract state it may expose congested sue public ridicule humiliation condemnation further the contract strongly advisors contestants you interact with Philip participants as if they were perfect strangers\nAnd intimate or sexual conduct between participants occurs the contract state of the producer has not requested or encouraged it so physical sexual mental and emotional health and wellbeing risks are assumed only by the contestant\nBlood production side of the reality shows realize that there is this moral gray area when they're trying to make drama using alcohol which is of course one of the flies that they've been using 'cause the show starts taping incandescents during this bubble\nThey they don't have their their their ...\nThey don't have the pacifier their cell phones they don't have these things right no phones no texting no Internet no reading material the contestants are relying only on the producers for direction for affirmation hey good job on that\nOr\nDo it again but do it this way or even information wonder is telling you only times is a very tricky situation because most of the time you're signing up to craft\nSome kind of interesting story and you get that from getting close to a moral line yes you do want to see sexual acts happened because that's going to create drama it's not like I worked for a church I'm working to create an interesting story line for television so then who's to blame when those lines are crossed\n\nA Chris ... has done a few bachelor shows and a twenty Fifteen he got blackout drunk before eleven AM that as he dedicated drinker he stepped into a fire pit\n'cause he was ...\nNo pun intended I didn't even realize until after it came out of my mouth\nHe shouted at a producer and then told another contestant that he would hook up with their mom because you're telling the only times\nI still take a lot of the blame for the way I was but I think producers told responsibility to they're the ones supplying the alcohol and the place or the place I'm sleeping or and what I'm eating it's almost like going to a bar at the right time the bar owners going to cut you off and put you in a cab\nAnd the producer should also cut you off instead of continuing to feed you the juice\nShirking of personal responsibility the producers are giving you alcohol but are they forcing you to drink\nThe alcohol see this is that strange\nYou know if there's something that that keeps it on the on the safe side of the gray line it's that you still have free will even when the producer hands you the shot you don't have to drink that of course the producers find individuals who are known to party\nThere they're not finding the total errors or who are going to come on to paradise island wearing their their lace colors and their frogs they're looking for heart buddies who are part time swimsuit models and have never been a fireball shot they didn't like\nThat's what the producers are after so they're trying to get to still\nEven though your heart body and you look great near her release\nI mean you have to do the shot yeah we break you know we still have another minute where I can tell people about uh the bunny ranch ah we've got about a minute yeah okay good so here's the deal I'm going to tell you this I'm giving a little bit of preview of what's coming up here in a second because I'm tired of talking about rapid reality celebrities\nThere was um maybe you're familiar with a buddy responding ranch is probably the most famous brothel currently an operation certainly in America\nAre innocent Nevada and I'm I'm so fascinated by Nevada and there are legal prostitution the proprietor the owner of\nThe money ranch die [noise]\nOver the weekend was it Monday\nTuesday [noise]\nThere was a Tuesday Morning was it yesterday morning [noise] whatever was anyway he died and we thought [noise]\nSo it's sort of a homeless in a vigil wary but a very informative one for this guy was just a second until years Mexico night on all the\nHe's ... ham why I have the Saturday Night live\nLook I'm I'm more of a night person but I Can't separate night I'll I'm not somebody wants to stay up until three or four o'clock every night like that\nLike in a good night's sleep and truth be told I liked being up in the mornings I just hate waking up but then some people their entire lives are are based at night that was done is Hoff Dennis Hoff everything was the nightlife\nDentist office the\n[noise] the proprietor of the moonlight Bundy ranch it's super famous brothel\nAbout we had some other major uh news happening here over the weekend we had the ... murder it sounds like Paul Allen cofounder Microsoft he died\nSo Dennis Hoff dying is sort of a you know sort of third cheer report but you have to understand this is really fascinating guy\nDennis Hoffman was the G O P contender for the Nevada Legislature\nHe is not only the guy that ran the brothel in Nevada he wrote books he had laws change she became a he became a a a giant cheerleader in politics and our own ... got a\nVery intriguing story of his time there at the bunny ranch wait until you hear the story because it's fantastic he was telling me about it last night so we have to do that on the air\n... things you need to know about Dennis hospital was\nBorn October Nineteen forty six so he passes away as not a young man but somebody who lived life\nLived a full life and filled every moment of\nNobody really knows much about that is off between Nineteen forty six in Nineteen Ninety two that forty six years just [noise] but that's when he purchased the moonlight bunny ranch brothel there was an advertising ban of brothels and\nA brothel owners were sort of\nThe advertising on the deal but Hoff said forget about it I'm running a business and have this businesses me I Want to be a star so he started showing up on\nRadio and TV shows you have to understand this is also at a time when programs like Howard Stern in New York or taking off and you've got a number of other radio host nationwide that are copying before\nMatt of what they interpreted a shock jock radio they never really got Stearns formula they didn't really get what stern was about a lot of the same ways that a lot of talk show host that I don't get what Russia does they think what rush does is just preach right wing politics I don't understand the entertainment value [noise]\nSame thing with stern they thought that he was a shock jock what he did is just he offended people sensibilities and then he was popular no he talked to people about those things that ruminate it inside themselves but he brought to light ... says one of\nThese guys that knew everybody's interested in sex and the idea of sex with a stranger is a fantasy for so many people doesn't mean you have to go do it but it is intriguing there's no doubt about it is in ...\nSo he shows up on these ... these radio shows he goes on ... and he goes on bubba the love sponge dopey and Anthony and mark and Brian and and uh I assume it was probably doing a D I see out here Jeff from Jared something here right so he starts hitting all these different big radio shows\nAnd then TV shows ... this guy he's his own brand new series on H. B. O. he was invited to speak at Oxford University and trinity college\nWas that your a brothel owner who understands the power of marketing and\nAnd pushing the envelope and suddenly you're speaking at Oxford he wrote a book in twenty Fifteen called the art of the pimp yeah\nThey the book was kind of a psychological profile of of hawks\nAt a psychotherapist called him a nurse assist with no empathy\n\nMind you that is the recipe for success in a capitalistic system don't look at a nurse\nAssist with no empathy as being necessarily a bad thing it just is a thing a diagnosis isn't good\nOr bad a nurse assist with little empathy is somebody who is ruthless in the boardroom with regards to is working women the psychotherapist says like any temp he exploits them\nThis is a distinct behavior and it's both unrecognized and denied and other words he says I'm not exploiting them I'm giving them jobs\nIs exploitation though there's no doubt\nAt Emory employers exploiting their employees but probably not the level that somebody running a Brussels exploiting their employees\nSo you want to be nearby but you still have to be so far away this guy\nSaid forget about it I'm gonna do everything I can I'm going on every radio tour every TV chore\nOr whoever calls I say yes and he did it all he knew how to promote himself master promoter also very colorful when it came to his personal life because when I came to intimacy he said he didn't like to date civilians he called it\nA he only did it prostitutes who all dumped him because he cheated on them which has a lot of scratching their heads as well [noise]\nEL were you working in Vegas at the time ...\n... no no no no I okay what's the bacteria and you're running into the sky okay so normally the story takes me about twelve minutes and I only got like three minutes so I'm I'm going to push this over something that as much as I can before we go to the break\nOkay I was working at a radio station in LA and we were thinking of different ideas or to do broadcasts from in the lead producer found out oh well there's this bunny ranch hotel and so they called and says okay fine we're going to someone of our shows over there [noise]\nHold on hold on helped me out here which was was it a talk station ... yes I guess as lookout station and you know we were going to do a live broadcast from abroad awful so you know\nShock value or are you trying to compete with the you know I was reading the intriguing angle and what was going on there intriguing the exploration you Howard Stern was there too as well and it turned out that\nA hobby was so into the media that he already had an ice tea and installed because there were many radio stations wine to come and do you know talk to interviews besides a high tech data line for those unfamiliar with like a phone line on steroids\nRight right right I Would radio stations used to to make it sound like food quality so it was the producer was myself who was the promotions person in the engineer and we all went up there and was a nine hour right so we get there and\nThe seat you see the bunny rabbit lights light up and it's basically a series of um trailers ... not not the you know the bigger trailers but how strangers\nOkay basically hooked up to one another and there's literally literally three gates that you have to buzz before you get in okay fine okay\nSo once you get in there is this what I Would call a large living room with a large bar in the back okay and when you come in all the girls come out there was like about a dozen of them are so\nI'm imagining every western movie I've ever seen like that where they walk in and just like girls yeah families are here yeah kind of ... it was a it was just intriguing to the field a menu walks out basically right right right and then half\nComes up and then um knees as here all the girls and here's the bar you know the drinks are on us there and we have a pantry the food's on us I have a human door the cigars are on us\nBecause you were media or let's hear all the way it is your every couple of he was\nBeing ... he was being jars okay interests and sell 'em and as for the girls you know whatever you negotiate did fifty percent off\nFor testing but I Know All right and that's okay and so I'm going where you wouldn't ... I was twenty seven okay so we're you experience between the sheets\n[laughter] did you have no Oh yes in in the most appropriate terms yes I was still virgin eyes\nOh fantastic I guess this is great what but all that matter to me was how to find out to do the best most interesting show possible right you're worried about your job right right right so so so that didn't I mean\nYou know what the
