is investigating Sarah Bartlett cocoa news\nWell civility has been the word all week before the bomb threats and now even more so so are we making progress\nWe're going to check in with Chris Merrill host of cocoa at night which happens right after the top of the hour news and\nThat's just like you to try to ask\nFor more civility using it [noise]\n[noise] no it was trying to make you do something I'm trying to get something out of me aren't you what do you actually know that's the first thing that people try to do when they try to take something away asked nicely yeah\nWeird weird place that we are and I think we've we've crossed over from trying to instill fear in people into paranoia we're really at this point where we the rhetoric that we use is paranoia inducing\nThe weight I get it you're going to say wait a minute Merrill we have to be cautious people can't just entered this country they are trying to come into this country illegally well the ones that are going to talk to the border patrol agents are not trying to get into the country illegally I think we have to wait to be careful when we start saying things like illegal entry flooding illegal to ask\nIf you can come in it's not illegal to ring the doorbell let's remember that yeah you sneak across the border that's illegal you ring the doorbell not illegal right big difference here\nSo we're sending troops to the border this is a smokescreen total smokescreen\nAnd why do I say it's a total smokescreen because it's illegal no it's not illegal to put troops on the border is illegal to have any troops on the border at any sort of a military capacity which is why you're going to continue to hear people say things like [noise]\nThey are being sent to the border in a support role\nThe support role\nBecause actually having troops on the border is a violation of what they called the policy comic hottest act now how do I know that because my producer is very smart and he turned me onto it basically what that says is you can't use military force\nTo enforce domestic law that was actually done after reconstruction part of that is because we had a lot of people in in [laughter] the truth be told ... if we go sort of behind the scenes it's actually because\nUm\nWe had a an issue with um\n\nWith rather for behave who was a Republican from Ohio running for president he lost the popular vote and he was getting crushed in the ... the problem was they had a bunch of southern states that\nWouldn't allow their votes to be counted so Rutherford have lost by every count except\nThat his opponent Samuel till the New York didn't have enough votes to get to one eighty five which is what was necessary at the time so what they did was the people in the north said uh you need to put in your twenties electoral votes three ... said uh you need to take your\nTroops out of our backyards so a deal was struck where the north said fine we'll take our troops out and you let us have Hayes is the president he's became the present you want to talk about some\nSome shady accounting you want to talk about bargaining for the White House holy cow there's an untold presidential story\nHave lost not only the popular vote he lost the electoral vote ... by a huge margin except that they basically bought the electoral votes from the south by saying fine we'll take our troops out of it as a result they put in this plus the ... which said you can't use\nTroops to enforce domestic law then they put it in a few very specific exceptions that it was used during the\nUh school segregation crisis in Alabama but there are a lot of people who become very divided over issues like the border they can become very divided over issues like\nCaravans coming United States and this I think is a great example of how we can focus on civility\nThe male bombings that went out yesterday and the more refined today somebody someone to De Niro and I've\nI've debated all day long whether or not I was going to be a bad are you bombing to me are you bombing to me joke and I decided against it so You're welcome for staying away from that\nUh but\nHere's where I think we can find some civility\nHere's where I think we can find this\n\nThe comparison has been made\nAnd it's by comparison has been made [noise] I'll give you a personal example suppose you go to your car you're getting your car\nAnd your son glasses aren't in your car where you always leave your glasses\nA strange and then you look around and wait a minute you're you're a little change cup is missing to let strange\nAnd you look at the back seat and you had some package back there that had come from Amazon the day before that's gone\nAnd you realize somebody got into my car so you know being the very secure person that you are\nYou going to pull up your security footage on your computer because you put a camera in because you're\nA ... I don't know if you're paranoid or if you're just like technology but you pull it up and you see somebody sure enough in the middle of the night broke into your car but they didn't work too hard to break in now you always lock your car but somebody comes in there and\nThey just pull on the they pull in the door or whatever and the door opens up you didn't lock the door somebody robbed you know should you lock your car door\nWhen it's sitting in your own driveway yeah you should should\nYou have to know why do you do it because you're cautious does that mean that you don't want that person who broke into your car to to have the things in life that they want to\nTo to have that doesn't mean that at all it just means that they shouldn't be stealing it from you that's it so you're cautious and you lock your doors night\nSmart you're smart doesn't mean you deserve to get robbed if you leave it unlocked but you don't want to so you lock your door another example because you're cautious right or you compassionate\nRight so here's where I think what we end up having with a arguments over immigration is people go you wouldn't leave their car a lot because you don't want somebody to steal from you in anybody's going to get into your car is going to steal from you\nOkay let me let me throw this one out\nHere Thirteen Years old you're at home [noise] cross the street from you as a yard where all the neighborhood kids go and they they play in the fall they play football in the summer they play baseball and uh and there are any other time of year they they figure out their own games\nThere was a few apple trees over there every now and again they have a little\nApple fight which always sounds like fun but it hurts when you start playing\nOne day while you're at home the doorbell rings you Thirteen Years old\nYou're pretty tough you don't really worry about who's at the door but your parents are there because you're just Thirteen open the door and there is a cross looking down there six foot two dirty face\nCutoff jeans no shirt\nAnd he says or your parents' home or your Thirteen you're smart even if your parents weren't home you would lie and say oh yeah they're sleeping right but this man says or your parents' home\nHe holds out his foot and on his right foot you can see that his toe used bleeding profusely and its bled all over the past way up to your front door your father comes to door and says can I help you or something oh my goodness and sees\nYour father immediately brings the man into the home takes the man to the bathroom helps him washes foot off and the man says\nThe city pays me to cut the lawn where the kids play I cut out one once every two weeks\nThat might occur in a minute my question is your assumption is everybody's stimulated states because they want something for free but you came to the United states for some reason and I'm guessing that the United states for more opportunity for them to be on their merit\nPatchy that hungry\nNow wait a minute mark a whole lot but not stop but you want other people to stop and think third world country that you don't want to go back to and you assume that it's because they want maybe it's the talk of the Arab world\nI married an American and that was my choice so I didn't hear what\nIt's All right so we'll just green card everybody union then good right singles single men to line up find yourself as girl Breyer on into the states where to go out and I know that they're really great glad to hear that way to worse else does a lot of appreciate the phone call [noise]\nJust messing with her [laughter]\nSneeze I'm Carmen Robert it's absolutely ...

S. marries into it and then says why is everybody was everybody's stopping in Mexico over the same reason you're married and in the United states Doesn't Suck that's why [laughter] [laughter]\nOh she was mad she says you got to tell us\n[noise]\nWell\nI've been reading out in a while I Am I I've been really nice lately that that's kind of stop [laughter] bigot feisty every now and again [laughter]\nAh write a civility or what you heard of before the break and if you missed it you got to download the podcast 'cause it was pretty fantastic uh civility is a not an example of what the what you were going on there [laughter] civil discourse no civil discourse [laughter]\nThe differences I think that people understand what I'm trying to rile somebody without messing with them that shouldn't be messing with somebody or somebody else takes debate\nThat it speaks volumes to the state of mind that's the truth speaks volumes and\nVolumes to somebody's state of mind but\nI appreciate passion about paranoia is a different thing you know who is really heavy on preaching civility was George Washington\nGeorge Washington this guy transcribed he was sixteen transcribe the rules of civility in decent behavior in company in conversation page one what not to do listen to Merrill show\nThe are the rules obviously transcribed and so it was a much older than he was predicted hit by more than four decades came from a French manuscript\nFord yeah fringe manuscript for decades yelled if the fringe manuscript came from Fifteen Ninety five is warmer Ellen de for decades as a century before all George came around [noise]\nIt was titled good manners and conversation among men\nWhich then came from an Italian book which was public published by a Catholic cleric\nOr in Fifteen fifty to share their rules are you ready here's ought to be civil one every actually done in company ought to be with some sign of respect to those that are present a here's one if you cough or sneeze sire yawn do it\nNot loud but privately and speak not in your yawning\nBut put your handkerchief or hand before your face in turn aside [laughter] this is a great one\n... along to everybody in college sleep and not when others speak sitting down with other stand speak not when you should hold your piece walk not when other stop or more a role for civility\nA shoe not yourself glad the misfortune of another though he were your enemy now when you see a crime punish you may be inwardly pleased but ... a show pity to the suffering offender and do not laugh too loud or too much in any public spectacle\nThere you go\nI think we run into that don't we do this the shade in front of a life\nWhen someone else loses we tend to celebrate other people's losses more than we celebrate our own victories\nIsn't that funny I think I frankly don't you think that's because we're more afraid of losing than we than we are of excited about winning it really comes down to risk reward were more afraid to lose something that we are eager to win something\nWhen it comes to emotions that drivers is fear and greed and fear is much stronger than greed\nIsn't that something\nWith why we have difficulty with civility and the lack of civility in politics which is\nProbably the cause of the current mail bomb events that we're living through civility see derivative of a citizen civility defined as a form of politeness and courtesy and behavior speech ethics professors as\nWent on this is going on there drinking it up together or having a grand old time they need each other\nReally back in history I'm going to go this is a this was the\nThis was the president who exposed just how the old boy's club works\nWhen you've got your big wigs getting together\nIn in ... picking at each other publicly primarily reaping rewards\nHigher voter turnout during a mid term than we've ever expected huge turnout during the last election the election in twenty twenty is going to see a a a downturn in\nTurnout [laughter] no no way and you know what they'd like this because they're working together when enemies become friends\nIt's because they have a common goal and that's just me saying that\nScience when did you hear about this experiment that a scientist didn't remember back in the fifties when scientists didn't really disclose what they were doing wait until you hear what they did to a bunch of an eleven year olds right this is such a weird experiment that really told us a lot a next course meal cocoa night news radio six hundred cocoa\nForward is Ross you buy at the G

early on in a while to look up more lottery set [laughter]\nNot really [laughter] you know we talk about the tribalism and we talk about the instability or which incidentally the woman who was upset with me still listening to the show\nAnd she is called back again she's very upset\nBe [laughter] if you missed the call I thought it would be able to get this worked up [laughter] I'm such a meaty if you missed the call\nThe ... she was pretty fantastic uh remember the Nineteen fifties maybe fifties back when we decided we didn't really need to be forthcoming when it came to scientific experiments there's been a a pushed\nWord ethics in science since then especially social sciences but I Do fifties get away with all kinds of blind testing and so they did a social psychologist did the tests in Nineteen fifty four\nAh\nBut the robbers cave experiment twenty to fifth graders so you're talking about how ... year olds and putting two of them invited to spend some time at a summer camp so it was set in a wooded area in Oklahoma\nThere were two cabins each one at its own separate swimming boating and camping areas not bad\nThese camps to be far enough for each other so the two groups of boys would not interact with each other and they did this intentionally they separated them so you're twenty two kids total split in half no these were average kids well adjusted fifth graders they all came from established middle class Protestant families\nBut I guess that they're all white\nOr because of the science at the time and I'm imagining the the ... the man is white kid in the white T shirt with his short shorts because that's what all the weird kids looked like back in the fifties\n\nThey were all above average in their respective schools all above average IQs right so you had you had a a a cross section here of pretty well adjusted young individuals and they said\nLet's take something that we can see is being intelligent and has the foundations to be future leaders of American let's see how they react so a week later each group of eleven boys as far as I knew I remember there were\nThere's no order there's only chaos there's only there's only this sense of it is I Want it\nMine territorial ism and this is my team that's your team this tribalism at its most basic and this is happening\nOn an adult level right now don't tell me it's not the tournament is the election and when people don't get what they want they throw temper tantrums they\nStart accusing one side of a manipulating more voter fraud or they start telling other constituents to\nDisrupt dinners don't let them eat really firebomb offices in North Carolina Sen pipe bombs through the mail this is the kind of nonsense that we as adults do these were eleven year olds doing this we don't grow out of it\nThen the researchers took this to another level they wanted to see if there was a way to take these two groups and bring them together [noise]\nSo they brought both sides and they said okay you know what let's have a survey of the daytime so the researchers brought together men of popcorn putting some movies are I guess it must have been on a real real at the time\nAnd they thought you know what if they spent some time together they're going to men and everything is going to be\nGlorious nope nope you had the rabbit on one side of the room you had the eagles and the other side of the room they call each other names they threw food at each other there were jerks there were a little punks\nThey already have you got a manner that as adults we would reprimand them before and yet as adults it's the example that we're setting to our children so the researchers thought All right\nYou know what they need they need a unifying goal\nThey have to find a solution to a problem that is mutually beneficial so\nThe researchers back in the Nineteen fifties these two groups of boys one the ... one group called themselves the rallies the other group called themselves the eagles two groups eleven boys in each group to eleven year old boys they cut off their water supply\nThat's harsh\nSo then they said we'll see what happens here are the groups had to fix the problem they had to come together to find a problem and then fix it started getting thirsty more Thursday they got the more willing they were to find the problem and fix it [noise]\nIt reminded me of nine eleven is divided as we weren't\nNine eleven happens and suddenly we all come together and go you know what forget all the other infighting\nForget tax\nDollars going to schools or tax dollars going the infrastructure or a tax dollars not being taken in the first place that about that it's about we all live together let's focus on this common goal and that is our own security and safety and ending terrorism\nRight focused together however just like after nine eleven once the boys fix their problem once they returned back to that zone of comfort camaraderie broke down\nAnd they had another food fight so the researchers kept throwing problems their way\nAnd it's the problems were significant and severe enough when the problems required a mutual aid in order to solve the issue restarting a a soul food truck I'm\nMaking food during a a a a camp out that they were together pitching tents with missing supplies where they had to work together in order to get things done the antagonism showed signs of mellowing and actually by the end of that final camping trip the rattler even went so far as to share five dollars that they wanted to being taught us\nThat was one of the games of the\nResearchers set up they shared their five dollars that they wanted the eagles to buy ... for both groups so in the end\nThe experiments showed how easy it is for groups to form how easy animosity can be developed but they also showed overtime and interaction with similar goals that they're going to be this level of cooperation\nBetween groups in other words with enough incentive we can stop being able to each other and we can start being friends\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nYou know no\nHow we talk about the media and politics and the ...\nIn Washington DC where it seems to be centered in the swamp which [noise] I mean at least even after you drain the swamp but still got a bunch a swamp creatures living there [noise]\nThat's what's going to bring us together we're actually going to come together simply because we don't want to be like our previous generations isn't it funny but the active rebellion for upcoming generations maybe unity [laughter]\nI mean we'll flip the world on his head\nDown man or what political analyst pointed to Ronald Reagan and Ted Kennedy\nSo they work together and immigration reform Reagan and Democratic House speaker Tip O'Neill we know about those guys that made a great working relationship with Social Security regular go out and have a drink with Tip O'Neill you'd raise funds for the Kennedy library he says today a lot of the pragmatism but I've seen in my political careers driven out of the system\nBut I see politicians focusing on is not a series of programs and policies but more alienation\nAnd anger so while this instability well one public policy professor identified three different degrees they create this political instability gerrymandering\nActually contributes to it where you are you're switching the voting districts around carving out the benefit one party what frustrates the other party a primary voting which if you ask me is a totally bogus partisan system that actually encourages the sort of division\nAnd campaign finance law that has allowed allowing large campaign funds be redirected to extreme political interest groups whether it's the Koch brothers or George Soros whether it's a massive unions or its massive corporations you've got\nTons of money influencing this\nProfessor says we're in the midst of the greatest economic inequality in America since the leak nineteenth century the bulk of the middle class is slowly shrinking away we're ... we're seeing growing this are disaffected groups of workers who not seen their paychecks increase\nFor decades was also the fear

to talk about the others other stories that deserve your attention but always get the airtime mostly because a blow\nVietnam fools are telling you how much smarter than you are\nA prison company included so what we do is we talk about this period and we say really on I'll tell us what else we should know in the others well she got going on there but semi standing by okay All right I didn't mean to surprise you with eight thirty [laughter]\nIt's been a long day so now and here we go I'm Megan Kelly\nYes ah she's a favorite of mine she earned her fame and Fox News ...\nHold on why I like the way she cares itself\nI think she is smart oh very she is smart very sometimes I think that she thinks sometimes she gets in her own way\nAnd she she has this she has this\nConfidence about her yeah that um\nI've seen in certain news people have and you're kinda like going yeah you're just you know you're just doing that or just for show no but she knows her stuff\nYeah she's not some some bimbo that they put on in order to try to ... okay well we have to have a female on the show let's just go get ... you know you can yeah do do your gym going to do with him you know I Know and I know he's really bright\nRight and the way that she carries herself is in ... and especially of the tone of voice\nWhere I think she has a lot of credibility when she's put any hard news arena yeah so when she moved from Fox News to NBC when they paid her like sixty nine million dollars to do so I'm thinking okay All right let's see what they do with her and then they put her on that\nUh today show off shoot in the morning that yeah yeah that I personally if other than that and fit and now it looks like ah she won't be back at NBC or Fox or anywhere else in the near future because according to the daily mail dot com Megan Kelly is out and NBC\nYeah her ratings were down and then she said for those that are unfamiliar she said uh something to the fact of um\nYou know when I was a kid a black face was just part of a costume hang on\nMegan Kelly is imported lay out at NBC after tomorrow to his two year run according to TMZ and people magazine hey six reporting the former Fox anchor also lost her talent agency and has hired a lawyer who was asking that Ronan Farrow be president in a meeting with NBC executives scheduled for friday\nI hate how it's almost like Fox wrote the story in celebration of [laughter] right it was like oh and she lost her talent agency well according to that talent agency now she switched because this current one wasn't doing a very good job I mean\nIf she's got down rating secondly agency isn't jumping in there and telling NBC what are you doing sticking her this crap show she doesn't belong in right she's so suddenly switches it up in an agency was going to fight for and everybody was looks like she lost her agency\nWas because you know how it is if you see someone that's successful and then they jumped ship and then they don't have being successful at shutting Freud\n... and and I hate that and you know and what's what's interesting is that all that turmoil Fox News with all the higher ups being looked at for sexual assault cases or abuser and all this other stuff all most of them are not there\nEither because I think she left or right before when all that started\nShe was a witness to it but she was not somebody that uh she was kind of a she was part of the whistle blowing but she wasn't for the lawsuits I Believe right\nRight right right yeah so NBC thought okay here's somebody and you hear somebody fresh we can do something right ...\nRatings she's uh she's gained some credibility with the not Fox crowd by bucking the Fox crowd yeah but the problem is once you're in with the Fox crowd nobody gives you the time of day isn't part of the Fox crowd\nPrecisely and plus there's already a saturation of\nOf their hard news presenters and anchors who can do that same thing you know so even though she's very good at it I don't there wasn't a chance for her to a shrine or be big Europe something different to make or shine and move beyond the Fox news or or that she kept\nThey were they had put her on sixty minutes type or a dateline type program I think should be good in the long form news magazine\nRight because what she has and then not I'm not saying not just because of look at what she has in terms of skill and talent and her ability to deliver", "show_name": "KOGO at Night with Chris Merrill", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "26"}
