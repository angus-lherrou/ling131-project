what we need to know I'm Indian or on the right\nAll right so it's that ah I'm standing in the middle of a hurricane and we all watch TV saying\nWhy would you do that we always wonder why why are they networks feel like they have to put reporters in the middle of a hurricane and one tweet said this is not safe lead by example another tweet says you know there's a strong argument to be made that standing in the storm is not a smart thing to do [laughter] [laughter]\nIt's true it's it's so hypocritical when you have reporters standing in the storm saying you shouldn't be here do two schools of thought here one is that reporters are supposed to be at the scene of important live events\nThe other is what good is it to be there for reporters are struggling to get the information out in the first place so reporters have become more aware\nOf this criticism of their unseen hurricane coverage\nThe weather contributor for MSNBC seem champion explaining a during Hurricane Irma everyone says well look if you're standing out in the storm Sam how come I Can't stand out in the storm\nAnd when I'm going to tell you is we do this so you can see what it's like outside at CBS mark stress min corresponded telling New York times part of that is the television is all about visual proof you wants to persuade people that what they're seeing is real\nAnd matters to them and even if they can see me standing out there getting knocked around it'll convince them that they should not be doing the same thing that is a question that I have all the time why in the world are you doing that you ... what is the value\nAnd put out their suppose credibility is is a big part of it right\nOr we're gonna go send you out in the middle of something really horrific so that people can understand just how horrific idiots in that regard\nAre whether people have become the canaries in the coal mine we are going to put you through ... the most awful\nCircumstances so that other people realize they don't want to be in the middle of this awful circumstances look how bad it is well go bad it is for the weather man I don't want to do that\nAt the same time there are so many of us watching and we say you're standing in the middle of a hurricane and you're telling us we shouldn't stand in the middle of a hurricane or\n... at what point does the message go from your mouth to your own brain so much of that do we need to have how much do we need to see well\nThere's some truth that we have to accept first of all\nIt was this coverage creates commercial media and they need eyes they need clicks they need the ears\nThey need readers all these different things and the way people watch is when there is something really active happening so there is a commercial aspect to it\nBut there's a public service aspect to hey buddy it's really bad out here well how bad could really be well here you go look how bad it is then again\nWe criticize some of the media because they tend to sensationalize it the ever love in wind out of that hurricane don't they\n[laughter] it's that old the yellow journalism you know you bring me the pictures I'll give them the war it's almost like hey the wind is blowing really hard how hard is blowing well it's it's it's definitely something I have to lean into you know what\nMaybe just grab on to that sign post and pretend like you have to hold on to the

corresponded [noise]\nAnd so the coverage of hurricane call it turned out to be [noise] of a break [noise] maybe the biggest break I had this is\nDan Rather Nineteen sixty one hurricane Karl ... news radio six hundred cocoa Chris Marilyn with me in Studio is Chris ... who is the head of NBC News radio in one of the most respected\nA newsman and and managers in the country uh in Chris uh you've seen a number of different natural disasters we just talked about a little bit of criticism of of some of the television media when you ... you must watch\nThe TV reports and you listen to the radio reports with a different era different by then what those of us do uh who are sort of just taking in the the disaster at the time you are I'm sure focusing on the reporting the style to safety the the public service side of that told me a little bit about what goes through your mind\nAs these disasters are approaching ... as they it and it's not\nJust a hurricanes you know it's it's brush fires it's a it's other things where you're putting your staff\nIn harm's way even terror attacks where you know the reporters are going to the scene of the world Trade Center at the time that you know ... ... actually even collapsed so you certainly have to take those things into consideration but I think for a lot of times\nYou know it's just kind of a human nature thing that the adrenaline starts going and people put themselves into a position where maybe they may at times not be a as conscious of their own personal safety so it was a manager you have to kind of watch out for that and make sure that you know they don't take it too far to the limit\nThey don't really think that what they think I got to get the story I got to get the the word out this is why I'm here yes I think it's so good and you're thinking about their family a little time writer\nAnd and again to you know I mean here in Southern California you know the the specter of brush fires and uh how we uh you know are out there covering those events and obviously there are things that\nHave a lot of attention you know the people who are who are seeing the smoke they want to see where it is and what's going on and so\nYou know you don't want to interfere with the public safety aspect of the story and and really interfere with those who are trying to save homes and save lives but still you want to be able to inform the public to provide that public service that\nI think is critically important er during a breaking news for you\nWhen you know something's coming how closely do you work with public officials who is this is his hand in glove or are they irritated that they have to deal with media as well as trying to do their own you know it depends\nOn this story itself obviously it depends on\nUm whether or bend and actually who it is you're talking to you know some sometimes hurricane in particular because we know that it's I mean because you have a couple of days\nUm the you have to really be careful that you're as objective as possible and you're covering a hurricane or when you're covering a war or when you're you know in a situation where are the events unfolding right before your eyes and also right before the eyes of your listeners viewers\nI Want to talk with you a little bit about some of the criticism a fair an unfair criticism that use it to the U. of observed to a a Christ Mary is my guest on kowtowing to use the uh the chief of NBC News radio a Christian sit tight there for just a second as we continue our coverage\nOr a little bit different it's what we're seeing and why we're seeing it in the coverage of things like hurricane Michael that his next it's kowtowing night news radio six hundred and cocoa\nThis report is raunchy you buy at the G N E Chula Vista that wreck on NATO five south it's at telegraph can into middle lane block traffic flow from East St also rack on the south five at the Ninety four in the right lane slow from the one sixty three\nAnd ... safety north of Fort rainbow valley boulevard it's a bigger I get stuck in the right lane traffic has backed up from the Seventy six\nI'm Chris Paine with your San Diego traffic has reviews\nDiehard radio is it is easy them more music\nDownloading free of charge radio F today [noise]\n[noise]\nSix hundred and cocoa and go go at night to Christmas earlier hosted in with me a very special us in a in a good friend of mine it's a Christ Mary who's the head of NBC News radio and\nHe's been a a mentor to me personally and I I find him to be one of the not only a best in the media business but I I find them to be a tremendous human being as well so Chris citizen honored I hadn't had left in my face I'd be [laughter]\nChris ... we were talking about some of this hurricane covered we've been talking about sort of the rule of media and you as a manager what you do to prepare for it what you what you give advice going into these different scenarios the emergency coverage war coverage all these sorts of things [laughter]\nThere's not a lot of criticism of media whether it's feeling as though you've got certain groups that are sensationalizing the amount of wind or the ... some of the flood waters whatever it might be a but then again we also talked about how you got some people who are leading with their flak jackets and they've got their their helmets on\nWe're watching it on TV nothing happens when you think okay what are they putting on a costume for us\nBut at the same time if something bad happens in the longer costume it's a necessity with what is the fair criticism that you've seen of media coverage when you look at an early you know leaders have a point on that one and then what are you what do you want to tell people viewers listeners readers whatever it might be that that you say look\nI Know you think this is being over done but sit tight here there's a reason for our madness\nI think that uh you know if I were to look at it as a news consumer which I Am a kind of inform news consumer I Would say that probably um the the biggest concern that I have is that you you take the listeners here in San Diego for example right\nYou know that those networks that are based in New York or even Atlanta and the case of CNN\nHave an east coast bias for what's going on in the world yes and uh you take for example a year ago almost exactly a year ago and the wine country there was there was a fire that destroyed six\nThousand home six thousand homes if that had happened in Westchester County\nNew York or or maybe in Arlington County Virginia I can assure you that that story would probably be on the news about every week if not every night a year later\nWhen the fires were on the heel of Santa Barbara fire jury\nAnd so you know I think that so so when you ask about you know so what are some of the ... what are the some of the areas news media you better with\nAnd I think that ah it's it's really trying to get people who have a more of a global perspective what certainly happening in the United states I think that there is kind of a parochial nature to\n... types of news that people in America are interested in a you know they're they're more interested in a in a news story obviously a hurricane or something like that then they would be if it was in a typhoon in Japan which we had one just a few weeks ago which was which was devastating to\nSo I think but my point being there are I think that uh there's definitely an east coast bias to uh some of the stories and you take like a an apple fire the Santa Barbara fires that happened last year I don't think they were really a covered that well by the national news media um I\nDo think that in this effort there to other things there you know one is that I think that the the nature of the political news coverage that has happened uh over the past\nYou know almost two years now or or longer actually if you look back to the election prior to that uh has really been a ... field by things that are not really necessarily news as much as they are opinion and uh if you watch CNN and the middle of the day or Fox or MSNBC\nOr you're not really getting the news what you're getting is a you know six people who ... they look like the Brady Bunch up there\nTalking about or what ever happened at the White House today and I think that as a result we as a as a public as a you know we we just don't know what's going on out there we're we're sort of being spoon fed the things that are driving ratings\nAs opposed to the things that are we need to we need to be we need you know and to take the next step and this was something that I you know a year and I may have even talked about this at one time is that now that we have the ability okay so everybody's got a budget whether you're\nWhether you're in the business of or a school you know you've got your teachers' salaries or if you're a company that puts down roof you you have a budget that you have a news rooms are the same thing they have a budget right and they want to make sure that they spend their money on the things that are going to attract the most attention\nOn now with the click of a mouse\nCan figure out the things that people are really interested in and I think that's a real issue for us as a society in general is the fact that we now um focus on things\nIs not concern and focus on mine and my my dad's Katie and I have much more important thing to think about I don't know [laughter] I Know people like Christopher ... media likes to claim to buy our marriage and\nUm I took off [laughter] but I understand the gossip says most papers magazine advertisers unfortunate have really\nI kind of our own [noise]\nThey are already creating it's not only staff around [laughter] [noise]\nI and I know how much of a government not true\nYou mentioned you you still have a good marriage you love your husband\nYes the revenue gas clean 'em by hand\nAll right so we're getting a lot of it's gossip media speculating but she didn't tell her she says she knows what is true and what is not true\nYou can tell us what that is ... ... ... cleared up worse than what is true what is not true and to her credit do\nIf she told us what is true in let's say that what is true is that he didn't have an affair\nHalf the country would say she's blind she's lying um she's a she's a naive all these different things if she said um I Know what is true and you know the president has had physical relationships but that's not\nUm anything that that the public should worry about because he's the leader of the free world and it it it doesn't matter what he does uh as far as those personal physical relationships half the country will be upset with her how dare you throw him under the bus\nWhy would you do such a thing and then you'd have others that would say well she's exactly right and and uh you know leave her alone leave him alone why can't you focus on what's really important\nAnd then you have another half of the country were three abs now who would say that there she told the truth now why isn't she doing something about an issue week\nSo on and so forth so it's a tough spot there is no winning nine\nIt is harder for her I'm going to pause it and it's harder for her to deal with the the rumors that the gossip as she put it a around the president's alleged infidelity\nThan it is for the president the president has control over the message the president has control over um how he takes questions he has control over all all the different\nAspects the different avenues he and his his Rudy Giuliani's they can direct ... whatever it is whatever that message is they want to get out there they can direct\nThat she is a bystander in the whole drama good bad indifferent she's a bystander she doesn't have any control she's a passenger on that journey\n\nThat is that is a hard spot to be in and we as Americans have a couple of reasons that we care\nThe first use and I think probably the ... if we're being honest the biggest reason we carries its juicy just flat out its\nIts juicy salacious it's really interesting to watch what amounts to American royalty and sort of the the tabloid stories that that surround them\nThe other side of course is that we care because we want to make sure that we're being led by an individual who is of the most integrity or who doesn't deceived the American people who is a honest with the people closest to him or\nSo on and so forth if you recall I I think it was a real crisis and I know\nAgain if we're being honest\nA President Clinton was impeached he was impeached because on paper\nHe perjured himself he lied about the affair affair ... that's why he was impeached on paper but what is the truth the truth is he was impeached because not because he lied under oath\nBut because he lied to us\nHe was a peace because we didn't trust the man his integrity of been compromised and if he was lying about something\nBut if he was deceiving the people closest to him how could we possibly believe anything the slick willy told us after that that's why there was a there was a crisis of trust\nWhen it came to Bill Clinton and that's why I think we care so much about the president's personal life is we care about the integrity and the trust me examples it's being set for our kids in Milan yet\nShe again as a passenger and that she is very very little control over the direction of the story of the\nMessage the best she can do is sit down for an interview like this and deflect I guess I don't know what we could have possibly expected from her again answering\nIf the first lady says that there's instability in the White House all of a sudden it's being used a witch plastered all over every Democrat out there is gonna start using the presidents\nOf marriage as the focus on what you should vote for them I mean every race from set it down a dog catcher everybody's going to be saying uh you know I support a strong family\nThat's exactly how it would shake out we know that we know that what is fascinating though is\nTo examine what would happen if a similar situation a war to occur with us and our own personal lives there is a study done a few years back uh twenty Fifteen\nAnd the phone with a woman finds out her man has been cheating it's not a physical connection that bothers her it's not the idea\nThat he was how do I say this checking somebody else's oil or under somebody else's food so to speak it has the potential of an emotional connection that perpetuates the anger\nAnd the jealousy this is something you don't understand we don't\nHere's a a um\nMen are from Mars women are from Venus situation here for women it's the emotional connection\nThat's that's a lot of guys obviously the physical connection matters\nBut for guys the physical connection as far as a fair does\nThat is how do I says ... would you agree with me that it's it's um\nIt's like a conquest is a goal and that the the culmination is the physical Consecration of that relationship goal achieved\nIf you want to look at it that way I Would use as a template\nUm [noise] I thought was that movie Michael Douglas when close\nA walk in the most part [laughter]\nTo boil buddy a fatal attraction oh yeah okay yeah yeah I was close\n[laughter] [laughter]\nFor guys know the idea that another man\nWould be how do I say a [noise]\nA home invader so to speak somebody else has has come into our into my private domain he has a taking my property so to speak and women I Know you're not gonna like to be called property but that's the that's the way the guys view things that marriage\nIs it's a bond it's a contract it's a connection\nBut your his you know that's my that's my girl and there is this possessiveness involved for women it's about that emotional connection so the weight of the two genders look at affairs is different\nWe're just wired differently for women it's not the the physical side you know where it's most women can't according to study can over look a one time casual affair\nJust don't fall in love\nWow so\nDoes that mean guys did you ever get out of jail free card no moron and the reason in many cases because the person that you're having an affair with is only going to consider the the escalation of a physical relationship if they have that emotional\nConnection meaning\nThe emotional affair that you're having prior to the physical affair is what bothers your significant other the most in the first place so you don't get to get away with it it doesn't ... it's not a get out of jail free thing for guys guys we just feel\nYou feel like somebody has [noise]\nSomebody has broken in [noise]\nWe do and and it doesn't matter how many new deadbolt we put on the door somebody has broken into our house [noise]\nI Know a mixing metaphors but [noise]\nThat's that's the big difference there between those who genders [noise]\nAnd in many cases for guys\nStill do not use radio six\nMonths' News I'm Carmen Roberts dire conditions for many who are stuck in the aftermath of hurricane Michael\nMy words can't take the path that none of this stuff going on ...\nWe been sitting here for a couple a day without water up on my body so dehydration ... decrepit last night\nJohn Richardson says he has no money and no way to leave a mobile home

the foundations from warehouses used to be but they've just been obliterated there is just nuts\nAnd he left oh who's going to be a\nA long long rebuilding process now if I'm not mistaken those houses that had some years to them\nThey weren't like built in the past twenty Thirty years\nSome of 'em yeah oh yeah and some houses whether them so to speak better than others but ah yeah I'm looking at one photo right now where it looks like actually some of the larger houses with the with the broader sides did OK I'm assuming those are the newer where some of the older homes\nThere's nothing left there isn't it looks like a bulldozer pushed them out of there they're gone just gone wow\nA it is Coco at night and this is the time that we set aside for others are stories that that matter a but don't always get the time you know yeah we talked a lot about the hurricane here and uh it was the worst storm you ever\nWent through the worst storm yeah what's the worst storm you ever survive a natural disaster Lucy that natural disaster\nNot to the degree of say like our hurricane because of a hurricane would come through I'd be going up gay I can walk and stop though I can\nYou know not ... yeah um you know\nWell I Would count it if if you if you vacated which came back in your house is gone we count that\nOh yeah definitely definitely and\nThat's where our kicking yourself about insurance or could I got more and more coverage I mean when when your\nA basis of life has been taken away gone I\nLiterally in an instant it that's why they keep on telling you be prepared to take pictures of everything update your insurance thing ah you know put everything on a jump drives sticking in a security box in a bank don't just leave it at home\nYou have to keep it on the cloud yeah well yeah I mean you have to have some\nStructures some copy of your life saved somewhere so that if it does go way via earthquake or a hurricane or a tornado or whatever natural disaster you have a basis to start from yeah you know\nTrying to see the worst storm I mean I was when I was in Kansas we had a I watched a tornado go buy from a distance the building I was in we were doing the radio show and the tornado came past and I can see the the top of the tornado you know the the the top of the of the funnel\nOr is it went through went over the city of Kansas City\nUh but it was it was like an F. one it wasn't a big deal I'm I Know it's it's like it's not a big deal that really was not a big deal it went through did a little bit of damage and then we moved on the radio station we had you know we were the Rush Limbaugh station and we had people who are calling an angry that we were doing storm coverage instead of\nPutting rushed back on I see yeah we had lots of phone calls to the station that were mad at us for covering the storm when Russia was on\nI think they thought that maybe the tornado was a liberal ploy\nWell one thing I did find interesting in in not necessarily
