we're on our own narrow psychologist Dr Michelle banks and says\nThere are a few key reasons why friendship breakups are tougher one of them we expected Dayton break up with other people\nBut with friends we often have many more years of history and memory and it's so friendship where we even sure I'm like the things that go wrong and romantic relationship\nWhen we lose that friendship like that we watch one of our most trusted confidante and then we'll pray that they know all of our garbage and we get close to the bone or a book of our lives for them\nShe says if your friendship does

after the top of the hour news it is called what night with Chris Maryland I understand tonight on the table sex and the NFL sex in the NFL or sex comma and the NFL\nThere you go it's all of the above okay or you know I was reading an article of Vanity Fair put out it was pretty in depth and they were talking about the cheerleaders and then you're sort of the evolution of cheerleading\nAnd why so many ... are pretty frustrated I'm sure you've heard this before the cheerleaders are are compensated often times less than minimum wage and uh there's been a few scandals if you'll recall as well with a\nA one group of true leaders that was taken a Costa Rica and uh they had their passports taken away and uh the the boss a take off your jobs and we're going to put on a show for these big dollar\nA ticket holders and uh it was a deal where if you want to get back to the United states you're going to be ... oh yeah bad deal bad be love law suits going on with that one uh so there are examples like this that's a pretty egregious one but there are a number of examples where basically the women are treated like a like sex objects\nAnd there's very little in the way of any sort of compensation benefits or anything of that nature so we're we'll diamond about a little bit we'll talk with sports guys because there's also the other side of the story which is ... did you not know what cheerleaders do on the sidelines now maybe you didn't know about Costa Rica trips that certainly understandable but\nI don't think the to the idea that you would be wearing\nA glittery tight pants would be a surprise and suddenly it seems to be very surprising to a number of people when they get into the into the leagues so we'll talk about that coming up here at uh if somebody was really kind of interesting and I don't know it was in change anything in the NFL but a lot more fun to talk about than people milling for the flood will tell you that right now\nAll right Chris Meryl ...

people that they do have multiple gig whether they want to or not it might be that they have to do to make ends meet for other people have multiple gigs because they just really enjoy doing something I Know one of the things that you do is you work with one of the great charities\nAre in the area right America like San Diego and that's something you do because you enjoyed your regular then right I mean it's yeah it's a job it's a lot of work but that's not something that that you go wow I Need to do you do it for yourself right to feel good and and the people around you\nYeah strictly volunteer work it's a great way to spend a five to six hours on a Saturday you know and it's really enjoyable miracle ego San Diego dot org it's a fantastic organization\nDoes miracle league of San Diego have ah cheerleaders\nInvaded not but in a sense the players can be cheerleaders and the fans do become cheerleaders great by default he's there a\nDress code for the players are fans when they take on the role of cheerleading no\nInteresting yeah interesting uh how much do you\nPay them to to be yell leaders are cheer leaders at the miracle league of San Diego events\nIf they've got a voice they can share as loud as they want a ... a paid out at the end of the game\nInteresting yeah okay so basically make as much as the NFL cheerleaders do correct [laughter]\n[laughter] it was an early I I wanted to invite you went to the program because I Know you guys talked with one of these ... somebody who's close to this issue is that is that right you as it up a conversation with well you know what was\nI you know as more so this year Chris oh there have been more and more of these stories coming up about NFL cheerleaders whether they've got lawsuits are those allegations toward\nThe NFL on the way they have been treated and just asking for a little bit more from an industry that it generates billions and billions\nOf dollars but you know talking with and Jay Costa ... does sports at the at our neighboring a seven thirty nine San Diego and has moved on to the NFL Network now\nYou know people ask themselves look at the cheerleader sort of put themselves in this situation there out there and these outfits and ... you know whatever way they want to describe a cheerleader and sometimes you wonder like why do we get why do they put themselves in the situation\nAnd for the first time\nIt hit me that she goes you know as a female as a young girl\nOne of the things that a lot of young girls are pulled toward is dancing they started dancing that such a young age and this really comes their craft and just like little league or pop Warner football or anything else if you have a passion for something\nYou continue to go pick up to the next level and once you get all these competitions you know throughout your teens and into college maybe ah you you know you make the squad for their your ear called University of ... direction you go it's sort of ends but it doesn't really have to be for her is like\nI put all this time in this effort this is something I was passionate about dance and one of the few things where I wanted to take it to the next level for as she goes in us not only me that's where a lot of females\nIt's the NFL you want to show your dance it's a skill you're ... you're utilizing your skills and that you have a passionate about and it hit me like you know what I get it now you know I I sort of get why this is it's their professional way to do what they like to do\nSo it's sort of the competitive nature that that an individual would have ended with you know without that things that they've been driving toward their entire lives yeah suddenly there's almost to the vacancy in their lives right there's just a whole where we're that dance or cheerleading or whatever the competition was that they used to do this is just there this\nThis is a way to say all those years\nThere is a paid off look I've I've hit the political\nYeah and you know and and and I've heard cheerleader say you know and they may use this avenue in a professional manner\nTo make connections and that's what you do\n... it's all about making connections with people you have the opportunity to run and people\nThat you wouldn't ever have like a TV executives TV reporters if there are some of these ah cheerleaders\nWho want to get into communications you run into people that you're not going to run into and have other opportunities so it's a way to connect with people to advance in a direction that you want to go professionally so there there are other things that you know get tied in to being a cheerleader but ultimately like you said it's about being competitive\nA lot more stories are brought up to a four game suspension now for putting your wife in the hospital\nYes it it just it just doesn't it just doesn't seem right and I think ah we've only scratch the surface on some of these stories that are that are being brought to the forefront about the way some of these cheerleaders have been treated and how they want to be respected and treated in the future didn't to Rob\nGronkowski have a picture leak that was showing his full grown at one point or one of his party's\nYeah and people just laugh at that it was like what a great guy you know [laughter]\nIt's okay for him to share leader as are posing in a professional magazine like playboy yeah with lots of we're brushing or that it's like oh I Can't believe that girl what a core yeah\nIf say like oh well that football ... he had been drinking I that's okay he can do that\nBut the perception of of the cheerleader drinking at all yeah exactly would disqualify her from the Supreme Court sorry that was [laughter]\nDifferent afterward [laughter]\nWhen you're good at it that imposed on us [laughter]\nOr anywhere like shit yeah [laughter] oh you're not already Martinez Ernie I Love you man thank you so much as you always make the program better whenever you're around ... said that that great to catch up you to be writing yeah enjoy your region or I Want to\nContinue covering this um this cheerleader story a little bit here because I'm Still\nI'm not full bore\nA me to on the cheerleaders because I think that there's confusion in the message that this message has\nTo be cleaned up because if they don't clean this message up nobody is going to have their backs there is a way that they can bring everybody on board and Ernie was hinting at it there a moment ago there was a way to bring everybody on board but this notion that\nUh do everything you do is an exploitation and how dare they and look nobody is going to\nPay you to put on a parka and stand on the sideline without moving [noise]\nYou know you're not going to make thirty million dollars a year standing in a park it's not going to happen [noise] so the question is where's the balance right now nobody's talking about balance [noise] they're just making demands [noise]\nReasonable solutions my friend's reasonable solutions after we check on your news it's going to a news radio six hundred code [noise]\nSneeze I'm Carmen Roberts it appears to be a done deal if no senator changes their mind

conversation on Facebook and on Twitter at cocoa radio [noise]\nGoing at a news radio six hundred cocoa Chris Marilyn a Vanity Fair ran an article that was really in depth in a great article about the basically the disparity between the the cheerleaders on the side of the field and the players that are on the field and uh they they drew a great deal of attention\nTo it made me want to miss treatment but certainly most of us would agree it's unfair treatment of the cheerleaders on the on the sidelines you know the question is in many cases how do we get here\nAnd\nWhen cheerleading started at football games and you had to go back to\nThe nineteenth century mean we are going back to the original\nNo helmets into leather helmets a football the rolling around in the mud days right the actual pigs skin being used in the football and there was a cheerleader what happened was that these Ivy League schools you had dunes\nBecause it was Ivy League schools you didn't have very many women there at all you do that would be at these games and they come out of the stands and they just start\nYou know do you mean what does well right that was what happened in fact\nThere were no women involved in cheerleading at all for very long\nTime or the nation which was a periodical uh wrote about marriage male cheerleaders back when Taft was in the White House you're somebody said at the time the reputation of having been invaluable to cheer leader is one of the most valuable things a boy can take away from college\nThat\nI mean they were reading articles about how glorious it was to be a cheerleader\nWhen you were dude\nNow it's almost become it's almost become in many cases in fact in many schools you'll find is it it's almost become an excuse to say that you are complying title nine oh well you know we've got a\nMen's football for women we've got surely they can just do that accounts lawsuits over that uh it was not until about World War two that things change and that was because you had guys\nWho were enlisting are being drafted and they were going overseas and women were left here on the on the mainland and they were doing a tremendous amount of work that had previously been a man's jobs you know the whole Rosie the riveter scenario\nSo\nSports is still going on the players who were not in the service at that time or had returned from service or whatever the circumstances were and remember league of their own even some of the sports the women were uh taking over some of the rules of sports\nBut in this case you had a football is still going on but they said we still want to have cheerleaders people like cheering and they need somebody to organize it so women said well we can do that\nSo they did and guys get back from the war and the the women have been doing a great job so they largely they just said what are the women are going to keep doing it there was some guys came back in and we still had a male cheerleaders who joined up in different ranks but\nIt largely turned from being a male dominated um activity to a big one that that women feel very comfortable being involved in envy the relationship that I've had with dance\nOr helped tremendously and thanks again to our guests are any Martinez who was on here to begin with really talked about how the the integration of dance or has propelled so many women\nWho have done dance or from the time that they were you know the cute little girls that are ballet shoes\nInto high school into college and the dance competitions and the you know the cheerleading competitions that are as much at a dance competition as anything else and then they're done with college and now what for many of the student athletes who had been involved with dance or gymnastics or whatever else it might be\nThe next logical step for them to say I want to continue with this and I want to be the best is to audition at the NFL but the NFL level [noise] it was I'm\nNineteen what they say fifty four I think\nThat the Baltimore Colts\nPut the first full time cheerleading squad on the sidelines and you've got to think Bobby socks and sweaters and\nPump ... home they didn't have any place to get dressed you know they had the visiting team locker room they had the home team locker room they stuck the cheerleaders in the boiler room us could just get ready in here\nThat was her dressing room doubled as a dressing room but they were making bank as you can imagine they made zero dollars in zero cents per hour\n\nCoalescing around a single message and what that message is after we checking

article about the NFL cheerleaders and [noise] ah the article was a\nToward what could be described as a mistreatment I suppose of ah cheerleaders [noise]\nUsing a number of examples the past of really really awful behavior on the part of the different teams and in many cases the uh the patrons of those teams who have more money than common sense\nUm the cheerleaders in large part are fighting back but even still there are cases where the cheerleaders who say look we're demanding some some wages the or the raiders settled with with cheerleaders for back wages\nAre just over a million dollars which came out about six grand per cheerleader that was part of the lawsuit\nThe buffalo Jill's said you guys got to pay us this twenty five dollars a game stuff is nonsense this is this is bogus do you guys are making bank you're getting corporate sponsorships that are worth\nHalf a million dollars and here we are doing the work of being a a told that eating that candy bars going to get us fired like twenty five bucks that work out so the buffalo Jill's sewed but buffalo said oh you're going to sue us All right\nAll right we're canceling of buffalo jewels no more so now what do you have\nA throw twenty five bucks a weekend still there are a number of of people forward cheerleaders they say look you know what you signed up for what are you worried about\nThere was a reunion in Nashville that um Vanity Fair talks about us they open their article and they say some of it at the reunion say privately that they experience similar mistreatment during their time in the NFL but rather than sympathize with their modern day cheer sisters they seem intent on siding with their old teams\nSaying none of this conversation about the pay and the discrimination and the treatment none of that is new to me Cathy core founder of the now defunct Chicago honey bears except my feeling is that when you come into a group you set a contract you know what you're getting into nothing that you're going to cry about is going to make it any different\n[noise] so how is it that the message is getting so muddied I think the reason is we're not exactly sure what the cheerleaders one\nThey seem to be complaining about every aspect of the position low compensation are being treated like sex objects are being flown around for corporate appearances without making very much money\nUm calendar shoots where they're not really being compensated at all for these counter shoots and in some cases the counter sheets are so very risque that they wonder\nHow this even um you know gets clear through PR\nSo what is it that you want do you want the position to be less risque do you want to not be viewed as sex symbols because we all know that the marketing tactic here is\nSex appeal that that is a long approving\nMarketing tactic but they also say well we need to be compensated more\nSo is this about exploitation or is this about compensation is the worst day nobody's going to pay you a million dollars a year to stand in a park on the side of the the football field\nIs there a happy medium and this is where I don't think that the cheerleaders have defined their message very well [noise]\nThe NFL has met with the cheerleaders they did this last summer they said look the NFL is trying to change your image from being the rough tough drink more beer um you know play more darts guy's\nHair brought Darnah the apple in my head William Tell see if it works\nInstead they're trying to focus on expanding their brand to women Syria they viewed as are the largest growth potential\nAnd being more family friendly and the way to bring women into the fold is to be more family friendly so they're saying well maybe the cheerleaders shouldn't be a a representation of sex symbols but rather should be a representation of a real professional women okay well how do you get that if you're also insisting that they have\nTwelve percent body fat which is unrealistic and secondly\nHow can you possibly say we need you to have\nA fourteen inch waist and the thirty eight inch chest how can you how can you reconcile those things\nSo I think the NFL is going to have to really focus on what they want but this is a time where the cheerleaders because the NFL right now is in a in a position of trying to figure out the future of their own leading the the image of their league this is an opportunity for the cheerleaders say look\nYou want us to go out they're wearing Lulu what little lemons and sparkle tops fine we like that we like you know we like a performing we liked dancing we light putting on these shows\nBut we want to make sure that these sparkle tops cover\nEighty five percent of our bras the idea that any of us could pop out at any given time is not okay with us or the ... they may be talking about the mid reps in how they want that to a you know let's get rid of the major is let's let's let's not open up the bellies or\nMaybe they like that whatever it is but the girls said look if you're going to treat it this way and you're gonna use this as a marketing ploy you need to pay us so cheerleaders I'm with you here I got your back but I Want to know what it is you want this is where\nYou guys need to come together and figure out what is it here on the parameters\nWe're not going to wear this we are going to wear this and you may have to be specific it may have to be things like will not expose more than Fifteen Percent of the the brass whatever it might be because let's face it the NFL still gonna want to have some cleavage showing\nNo you go Dr all because you love volleyball you you'll give private lessons and volleyball because you love coaching these girls you love that you love it that's why you do it in the same way that every little league or\nDad out their volunteers to to go coach third base if he can\nNot because he needs you're not making any money on it but because he loves it loves it the fact that this teacher was getting some compensation that uh for doing something that she loves a is a benefit\nBut I don't believe that by giving her a race suddenly she would stop doing these other things is not to say she shouldn't have a race she was being a willfully underpaid I think her to her salary was somewhere in the neighborhood of\nUpper thirties and it was silly but we have to also differentiate where we start talking about\nSome of these people working multiple jobs how many are worked multiple jobs because they have to you and\nHow many are working it because they need it because they they want to [noise]\nMultiple job holders make a five point one percent of the total employed in August and the share has been hovering around five percent since the expansion began in mid it two thousand nine isn't the only times that's despite unemployment having plunged to latest number three point seven percent they had three point nine percent in her article which was written\nYesterday I think yeah came from Bloomberg but a reprinted the LA Times [noise] ah\nDid you do a monthly hiring gains averaging two hundred seven thousand this year are well ahead of the twenty Seventeen pace\nOr the latest one is you just heard from the Fox news report was was below that it was less than expected\nThey think that the hurricane probably a lot to do that to the September payrolls a report was due today I just share that with you a pay games have been disproportionately moderate and employers have been slow to increase hours and benefits the primary reason that workers continue to rely on a patchwork of jobs\nEconomists point out that the data also reflect\nCross currents including the gig economy educated people opting for the challenge doing more or younger workers seeking variety\nAnd work life balance credit Ryan sweet ... monetary policy at Moody's saying labor market as not as equally tight across the country the pickup and worker pay hasn't been strong enough\nSaying by almost every metric the labor market has really strong which means there's a lot more opportunity for people normally they say a declining share of multiple job holders\nWould be considered a good sign that more people are transitioning into regular positions more benefits better schedule but and this is key here but more people are transitioning to a sees me about the data are probably\nAlso capturing something more structural\nLinked to the changing nature of the economy and demographics\nWe may see this trend stay fairly stable\nSo we've got unemployment dumb we've got wages up slightly according to the economic analyst they say the wages of not growing fast enough even though they are starting to come up a little bit which is good they're not coming up fast enough [noise]\nBut that's not the reason people are working multiple jobs it goes back to something I mentioned a moment ago and that is\nThey want to they want to work
