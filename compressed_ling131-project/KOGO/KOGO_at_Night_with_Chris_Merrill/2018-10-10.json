should you care because what's happening there\nSeems to be exemplary of certain inner turmoil is happening in Egypt ways around the state especially in areas that have higher cost of living San Diego a San Francisco or parts of the LA metro\nOr Ken Hayman was the acting president of the homeowner's association in open mind village and he was\nAt the middle of the pickle ball debate\nWealthy residents wanted to build a court the pickle ball court that they were I bowling would've cost at least\nThree hundred thousand dollars [noise] truth be told I really don't know what the going rate for pickle ball court says\nI don't know how much it would cost to build a racket ball court I don't know how much a tennis court costs to build I Do know that a ping pong table can usually be picked up on Craig's list for about a hundred bucks\nIf that [noise]\nBut why is the three hundred thousand dollars in this large community such a big deal well because in order to raise the three hundred thousand dollars the H o way\nWould have to raise their dues so you've got people who have money than say we want amenities\nAnd you have people that live in a community that have been there for a while that say whoa whoa whoa let's not go raising the dues because you want certain amenities there are other places you can go if you want those entities or other places\nThis is a no frills low dues fifty five plus community\nPretty simple but you have some people that have more money with that money they bring influence how so [noise] well in this\nFifty five plus retirement community ah this was the big story this was a good deal right the rest of the country is arguing about Supreme Court justices the rest of the country is arguing about Russian influence the rest of the country is angry about just about everything but\nMy village they knew how to create their own inner turmoil they didn't have to bank on what Washington DC or Sacramento is doing they said forget them let's create our own nonsensical fight and they did\nThey did just that so you had two camps you had the ... and you had the no pickle bowlers\nAnd uh things were not coolest cucumbers and these two camps\nYep came up with that one off the top of my head I'm a Buddy Guy here's what happens\nYou have the group that wants to pickle ball may become some money\nThey have the money they don't mind raising do because they want these amenities to them they see value and the increased cost of living in this open my village\nFor other people they say we moved here because it didn't have amenities and the costs were low we want it to stay that way so really breaks down to haves and have nots well\nAs you might imagine what happened in ... village is exactly what we see happening around the

unfilled head of an animal your next desktop it's over pickle ball\nThe whole problem is more about a a growing issue in the fifty five plus communities\nAnd on one side you had the people who planned invested manage their money\nAnd allowed them that lifestyle that they want to keep going into retirement on the other young people who tried to plan to try to invest that tried to manage their money they weren't a successful maybe they didn't have the nesting to start with maybe they got hidden that recession\nWhatever it was they're trying to hold on to the lifestyle that they have they're trying to live within their means and what they don't want is for somebody else who has other means to come in and start demanding how they will spend their money\nWell you've got residents like Dario

first of all if you have the means why did you move into this fifty five plus community but doesn't have the amenities that you want I don't know enough about ... village community there it may be the

don't have the means those who are trying to act responsibly aren't able to because of a chill way restrictions maybe the problem is age ... and Jen [noise]\nMaybe the problem is that you've got a

we interact with those around us and that's the story we've been talking about in northern California fifty five plus community\nOr with the one group of house versus another group of have nots both living in the same age away\nOne says we want a pickle ball court dealer says we don't need to spend money on a pickle ball court I thought you know what let's let's give somebody who really knows what they're talking about here so I invited in George Chamberlain our business editor are here and to go go in and George is such a fantastic\nGuy to have on the program it was a pleasure to have you so Georgia I guess the the question that we all have in her mind that is um what is the future look like is the baby boomers are coming to Asia we're already seeing you know people arguing over the haves and the have nots all living in the same community but this isn't\nI don't see this getting any better as we have a a larger population reaching that that threshold fifty five sixty sixty five years old are you seeing are you seeing him in changing\nThere's been a lot of things that have changed Chris and I think the one thing that probably for the boomers for well maybe not so much about some of the rumors but certainly the millennials\nIs the absence of retirement plans you know it used to be that if you worked for a company and this would be true of many boomers but certainly the generation before rumors or you work for a company or they get money into a pension program and when you're retired\nThat money was returned to you and the company put in and most of the money in the form of a ... so you knew that every month when you're retired you're beginning X number of dollars and\nYou could do some some work to supplement that by having a A R a four one K. although the four one K. is really did lead to the demise veteran program but you know ways of saving and taking advantage of the tax benefit\nPeople that are going into the job market today do not have anything like a pension programs they have a program they can contribute to and the employer match some of it in the form of a a four O. one K.\nOr something similar to that but it's ... it's the one big thing that I think it's changing from generation to generation\nYou know George I'm fascinated by the whole pension thing because my grandfather retired full pension from I Believe it was the the electrical workers I BWI okay or you know and after he passed and I think my my grandmother got you know some of the benefits as well my other grandfather retired he had some from General Motors but in both\nCases was required that that that that organization or remain fruitful that was always the risk wasn't it with pensions I mean ... if if a company we are going under the pension funding how to be part of a bankruptcy plan am I right on that\nYeah I think in most cases it was and and I think that in in most cases there there was ever a problem but here and we're from time to time I ... I go back I think about um\nI wanted a big car companies went through that went through a bankruptcy reorganization had to had to find a way to the court demanded that they find a way to protect their employees yeah\nOf course we see that on the municipal level in San Diego especially now it looks like it's coming back around uh\nOr reusing them more easy\nDownload them free I hardly to us today\nSave money at anger funding dot net\nA mile run for tomorrow with three on news radio six hundred go go\nGo go in that news radio was centered Togo some of the headlines and our\nNewsrooms been following the remembering a just in the ...

I tell you if you're somebody who whoever goes in a realtor dot comers yellow or red or anything like that\nYou're looking for places right you're looking you're looking you're looking all of a sudden you run into something like three bedroom two\nAnd the list prices like Jordan\nTwenty five thousand dollars and you're west of the five and you go to this must be a scam and then you open it up and you see that it's relatively new a mobile home in a retirement community oh\n\nEven the ones that are are in a mobile home my wife and I looked at a at a retirement one time [noise]\nRetirement home in one of the shift fifty five plus communities we um we were looking for houses and we saw one like the price that was like on a golf course with all this looks really great let's go check it out we did\nRealtor was there was an open house right so we're walking through in the world there's there's no this is a fifty five plus community you know that right and we both looked at each other we went\nOf course we do we're just check it out 'cause my parents are looking at retiring\nWe had no no idea no idea it's a nice place it's a nice place and that causes a lot lower than most of any other subdivision in the area we sure liked it\nNow when we have read this I\nMean it explains why you've got people working multiple jobs why you've got the gig economy you have two different kinds of people that are working the multiple jobs one\nThose that go the rent is too damn high right that's the the the New York a party remember when the guy was running for he was running from the rent is too damn High Party and in New York for ... he didn't make it but a lot of people felt as pain\nWhen you know the other side that says I like the social aspects of a second job how about the people that are trying to retire people who have\nWho have followed all the charts the people who have said okay I have to have X amount of dollars for retirement they hit that goal they hit sixty five they say that's it I'm retiring done I hit my goal I should be okay and then\nWrite goes through the roof mortgages go sky high\nAs you just heard George Chamberlain talking about now we've got a uh we've got a situation where people are going into retirement with mortgages whereas the old rule of thumb used to be you never want to be paying a mortgage when you were retiring\nIs your biggest bill every month right does your mortgage although for some of you might be your student loans and I understand but that mortgage well when you're retiring you don't want that expense hanging around your neck probably not going to see this change a whole lot\nUm next hour we are going to a talk a little bit sort of feeds into this\nAnd that there is a way to see there is a way to check someone's aptitude toward\nCertain advantages they might have as far as career goals as far as\nUh whether or not there the sort of person who was going to squirrel away the money or if that's the sort of person who may be working long into their retirement years there is a way to forecast this and scientists have come up with it\nIt also may open Pandora's box and it it has a number of different ethical and moral questions will give me a chance to weigh in on those in just a second but before we do [noise] um and a passing and San Diego has been pouring into here for the last\nCouple of years it one of the

saying no brain scans can tell you everything you need to know tell you who's good at what\nResearchers monitoring the brain scans of surgeons as they performed simulated surgeries\nThis is I assume what virtual reality has has added to uh our training\nWe have virtual reality now instead of somebody as a surgeon having that first surgery where they're in charge which I always imagine ... somewhat nerve wracking unless it's a situation where they've assisted in so many surgeries that they could do it themselves and the the primary surgeon just sort of backed off a little bit and then says congratulations you just did you first surgery\nAnd the the novice surgeon says oh my goodness I guess I have I guess I did handle that did not otherwise imagine your first surgery you have to have steady hands but you must be nervous\nI Would think you'd start out something smaller imagine being a heart surgeon it's your first heart transplant\n... do you start on animals paintings you know where you start with that you should die right in\nImagine that you've got this novice surgeon\nThat instead of walking in and saying well Mr Smith are watching all you're in good hands I think I'm here's what we're going to do we've got a donor heart we are ready to go we're getting that perhaps the war is set\nA I Hope that you're already here and Mrs Smith I'm no vote goes well we'll be out and about to ten hours and your husband will be in recovering well just try to make sure that heart doesn't get rejected by his body we've pumped in full of a bunch of anti rejection medicine and uh and if it were to be in good shape or right\nJust a spoiled you guys know oh this will be my first so I'm pretty pumped about this I Hope you guys are too right come on guys let's go ah now where's that heart lung machine\nDoesn't really still a lot of confidence do it\nThat much surgeons that have tried things hundreds of things can still have ... with virtual reality you couldn't run through practice heart surgeries however many times you need to fantastic\nAnd now we've got scientists who takes surgeons and they say hey not surgeon you're just out of surge in school or we're going to get the VR virtual reality and we're also going to monitor your brain\nWhile you do the practice surgery insurgents a coup so they go through it they do the surgery\nAnd everything to them is in real time real life that's virtual reality it's fantastic\nAnd then decide to say here's what a brain scan show you're really terrible at surgery whoa\nBut now the surgeons actually showed more activity in the brain that involved planning complex behavior where's the skilled surgeons\nShould more activity in the motor cortex area which is vital for movement in other words those that\nDidn't have a lot just as we might assume those that didn't have a lot of experience went into things saying I Need to plan for a B\nC D E F G those that were super skilled said I already know what the plan is I just need I Need to focus now interesting isn't it the belief is that the more skilled surgeons just moved\nAnd now the surgeons had to think about what they were going to do Wall Street journal reporting story saying that the symptoms can assess levels of expertise and competence\nUsing neurological data they added rowing excuse me they had to a growing body of research on brain activity aircraft pilots\nTraffic controllers athletes doctors and others to gauge mental workload skills are learning\nCoordination and that information could have implications for how workers are trained and then how they do their jobs\nSo\nHere's where things get a little bit scary\nWe've got this brain scan technology going through a this renaissance before somebody that was having their brains scanned had to sit and then go through that MRI right they had to they had to have\nA pictures taken of every millimeter of their brain was put together and a composite now there's all wired skull cap that can be attached to the brain and then the brain can be scanned while people are doing complex activities\nAnd do we saw what scientists map the brain under circumstances that are in reality\nRather than I Want you to go into the brain machine and imagine you're performing surgery we're going to put you into a VR machine where you are going to be performing surgery and everything to you will be real except for one actually be a patient on the table is just gonna feel very real to you because you're in virtual reality\nWow\nThat is a very precise brains can you can get out of this all of a sudden and immediately\nOh what I think she is saying which is the entire point of the question yeah if you don't understand what you're saying you don't write down anything\nAh but I put down to it and they said yeah you you ... yeah yeah you're totally screwed up all up right interesting\nWell I worry about this because if we start relying too heavily on brain scans does it take out the human aspect so for instance let's suppose we're hiring somebody to be a producer on this show right and we find out okay does this person have\nYou know we can go to their resume was okay well they have an education and we dropped out of four or five schools so that you know that's pretty good uh in comparison to mostly applicants that we get um [noise] uh let's see they ah you know they they can research things they're writing skills are pretty solid but we'll come up to a brain scan and it says uh\nYeah this person is very organized this person really knows how to how to ah ah to root out a a a story or this person would according to the brains can make a good\nProducer okay\nWhat if that brings getting doesn't tell us that they are in an insufferable border and every time we get around that we want to strangle him because it takes them forever to get to the point\n... my one main metric how quickly they can make a decision now many times I may not be the right one but the decision but it's a decision that they came back up\nAnd that's just reproducing it's for any job right yeah but more so in in in the thing about the times where you're just face was something special breaking news\nOh yes disaster okay I've got to do this do that and you know you you gotta you gotta you'll pass scale yeah old Walter ... wine and say okay that and then it's situation changes you got to redo it all on one\nOf the brain scan doesn't show that but now let's go down another road here\nImagine if the brain skin does show that certain people were certain areas of the brain being stimulated certain aptitudes well what if I have a lot of money and I send junior out to have a brain scan\nThe brains can't comes back and says it junior probably is going to be an assistant hotdog cart manager for the rest of his life he just doesn't have the aptitudes\nUh and I say I need junior to be a hedge fund manager they go yeah he can do that so now I've got enough money why did I go get another hedge fund manager has been very successful I get a brain scan of them and I take that brain scan and I start stimulating\nThe brain ... junior here and I start putting him through hedge fund school [noise]\nRight there you know that my kids are screwed [noise] uh and uh and suddenly now I've got the money to be able to get my kid into a career is going to pay more when he really is about as dumb
