we talked about this\nAnd this has evolved a little bit we'll ... we'll discuss\nWhere I thought you know what both of them could have handled this a whole lot better\nAnd I got to thinking about the ratio of guilt the ratio of guilt I Want I Want to talk about that um [noise]\nIn other words who's culpable does anybody innocent when we have these these different incidence sometimes the answer's yes sometimes the answer is there is someone acting completely completely out of line you there are some examples of that and just a second\nBut then again there are also situations where you say you know what I can see where both parties are coming from\nNow which one do we put the onus on to make things better words what is the ratio of guilt\nWill consider this will get your thoughts on it to

anything\nHow the ... the first day that\nNo we open the phone today and every six hundred Togo and we asked what people thought and uh we got ... varying opinions\nBut there were there was all ... ... a good number of people very strongly felt like she was acting out of a racial prejudice\nBy the way did you happen to those is one piece here where they they make a point to say that she's still legally married to an African American man was heartbreaking\nAnd those are words that truly cut the\nThought it was still legally married to an African American man says she would not change one they\nLegally married [laughter] [laughter]\nSo evidently her estranged husband is married well black too I guess so I mean something's going on there just because you're married to somebody of a different race doesn't mean that you\nAre not racist though are we probably all know somebody who\nFits the profile of having a close relationship with people of different cultures but still hold a certain prejudice in fact we probably know people I'm certain cultures but hold certain prejudices against other people or their own cultures\n\nI look at the scenario and I certainly see both sides of it I Do\nI think both of them could have handled this a whole lot differently if she easily could have said hey look I'm Sorry I don't want to come off is is is being you know will miss knowing all hear anything but you got the same emails I did you get the same notice as I did from a condo association [noise]\nIf you live here to show me your ... your coffee\nI think it easily could have gone

being ridiculous he thought she was being racist\nYou could kind of understand where both of them are coming from knowing what they knew but not acknowledging what they didn't know about the others see that's where that's where I feel like\nI feel like these incidents all too often have a lot of ego and not a lot of\nCuriosity thinking were curious about the other person's perspective then\nWe end up asking more questions than creating arguments this woman so she was following the what the building owners pulled all tenants to do and we've had another incident pop up nationally\nYou've heard of the what was it was it\nBarbecue Becky permit Patty and all these other living well black incidents where\nPolice are cold because there was a black person not breaking the law somewhere but

the police or cold or in what is so quickly becoming known as living while black\nThen again there are other areas that are a little more gray we explain one earlier this week where we had a white woman who was leaving her building in a black man was trying to\nGet into the building she didn't recognize the guy the guy who lived there you pay the rent and everything but she didn't know it and so she says an easier ... we're not supposed to let strangers into the buildings isn't a stranger I Love you\nShe says well great to show me your key fob and then there'll be on my way he's the only to show you my ... I live here I don't need to justify myself to you\nAnd you start to see both perspectives on that when you go he's probably dealt with a number of people in his entire life that automatically assume he's doing something wrong whereas she's trying to follow the directions of the condo association which are dealt with strangers into the building unless you verify that they've got a a a key card\nYou can see both sides of stories like that we've got one here locally will get into a just a second but I I Want to give you the pay off on this a golf cart Gayle in this case you got a woman who a cruise around in the Gulf current because I Believe she was part of the the local\n... athletic association of the field association of some sort she's a she's a rep for them so she gets her little golf cart she's on a power trip\nThis is kind of like the the teacher way managers would just run around with a golf cart in a clipboard and take measures to make sure that your grass is not more than three inches long so this is what he's done a bit of a power trip well she sees a guy who's yelling\nAt one of the soccer games and he tells he's yelling to his son hey the ref was right getting there\nAnd she says search harassment will not be tolerated he says oh our my son to getting the game so you can stop harassing me right now I mean it was like a bad episode of South Park where it just escalate for no apparent reason\nBecause twenty Eighteen it caught on video\n[laughter]\nWhat do you know they don't talk to you\nDon't talk to them I thought\nHe was standing there and then there was some lady the size of ... and and now calling us off because he was talking to my son\n[noise] and\nSo now it it cuts to you heard that the person who was recording it no cuts to the police showed up the the sheriff's deputy shows up and they're now they're sure if W is talking to the father\n[noise] and I always [laughter] [laughter]\nWell [laughter] I\nFelt that this woman sat there on her car and was very intimidating presence she herself\nHey get call yeah pollen or is it was a nonissue until that parent or somebody else and I see ... zooming around says she's sitting there\nJust waiting and creating tension and follow this man out when he said hey I'm going to leave I don't want an issue so why she felt it was necessary when he voluntarily left on his own accord to\nAvoid and you see I'm Still going to call the cops on you\nThere's also audio of the deputy talking to her where she said that he was yelling and then he really escalated it he said I'm done talking to you and he was he was talking to be like that he said I'm done talking to you and and I don't have anything else to say hey can you believe he did she says the deputy\n...\nMeanwhile here we have a principal in lawyer who sent out a warning to parents\nWatch your kids you got to watch your kids while I watch kids well according to UT last month or\nThe principle of loyal elementary school became aware of an incident about a man who had allegedly stared at and followed a parent's daughter like just every daughter is a parent's daughter\nAnd a local Starbucks principled on a trip you sent an email that described a man is an African American male about Thirty years old six one to six to\nRest at all black and who did sweatshirt you know went on to give parents security tips about keeping your children's safe including calling the police if you see something that doesn't feel right we're hoping that this\nIs an isolated incident but a reminders are always helpful [noise] All right you've got a well meaning email but tribute got some grief for people who found the email so vague\nAs to not be helpful at all but yet it did put out stereotypes of black people but there was a black man staring at the children probably not what she meant I think there's a great example of some of the institutional racism [noise]\nShe said my you know it was a mistake it is critical to keep our school family safe the way I communicated didn't provide enough specific to identify the individual but could easily lead to unnecessary and harmful reactions against other members of our community [noise]\nAfrican American males continue to face discrimination our society every day the thought that I I'm actually contributed to that climate where the big email or something for which I or community an apology but that wasn't good enough for some people will tell you why you're just a second [noise]\nTrigger news is going to cause injury\n[noise] he's ...
