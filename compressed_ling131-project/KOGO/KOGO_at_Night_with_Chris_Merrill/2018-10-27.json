times a few times before that I weighed plus three hundred pounds yeah and so I came across some fanny packs and the most I've ever had contact with the fanny pack is fourteen seconds\nTen seconds to realize that that wasn't enough fanny pack to get around my waist and four seconds to say okay how does this ... it does not look good does not feel good is not functional however when I travel I Do

you can to keep duct tape and clothes line\nAnd ah that's about it right All right but see you're on a construction site and you know you need something that's not too big not too small but a little belt yeah right right right yeah but not a fanny pack right but sometimes it can be used for that it's very it's very limited\nBut yeah making excuses for creepy people are well yes true but but the thing is in that in when people would you use a regular basis fish that theme parks it you're right my ...\nMy wife got me one last year she thought it was funny it was this a fanny pack that looked like a bear man's Harry belly I'm I'm like what is that you want me where there's like a costume I don't understand what this is my supposed to not have a shirt on\nShe says no it's supposed to look like your shirt came up over your belly and I said but it doesn't doesn't look anything like that\nAt all yeah that reminds me of ... ... couples are two people who wear the T shirts that point to each other with ... with us to put phrase I'm was yeah oh my wife made me do that too there's I'm leaving on look what's on oh oh oh no yeah oh\nYou should see my face I Am miserable I didn't eat for a year after that I lost a I was up to eighty six at that point I dropped down to just under two hundred yeah some people are in a cost all my wife maybe where that giant shirt yeah some people are into costumes I'm not no no but some people that\nI've done these costume parties that are actually for a charity I did one year after year after year and they raise a lot of money for breast cancer center I'm In in Kansas and our radio station was heavily involved in it and my wife worked for the hospital\nSo we were big on that one but it's always on that Saturday right before Halloween and I tell you that was a great time to have a a party and the thing is the party didn't start until I don't think it started until nine maybe at night\nSo even Halloween were on Saturday you got the kids out trick or treating and you got back in time to get the babysitter settled in to get your costume on it had on out even if you didn't get the right at nine o'clock when the party started was sort of come and go sort of sort of thing and they had\nProbably Fifteen hundred people show up over the course of the evening it was a massive deal I Am seated a few times I Will say my wife did a nice job

don't know what else is in a dollar stores or whatever\nI thought man those things are everywhere Halloween\nIs Wednesday but the spirit shops are making their money today and tomorrow really this is the big one the the rest of it's going to be basically parents coming in to get the last minute stuff for their kids I didn't realize is the average spending per person\nOn Halloween is Ninety dollars\nWow\nHe does that mean is that per adult or is that per person I mean that means that if I've got a family of five numbers were got worse by the four hundred dollars on Halloween it must\nBe a hundred dollars on Halloween I think it's ... ... ah yeah I I Know no one that would unless you're a Hollywood uh a special effects artist I don't think you're going to spend more than a hundred bucks on Halloween\nI bet they're factoring in when they do the numbers obviously that's a total Halloween spending divided by number of people so I'm Wondering if they're counting alcohol in there as well for parties see that alcohol and and and snacks and buffets and and\nCatering Z or whatever else goes into some of these more elaborate parties and then I suppose special effects fog machines all the other goofy stuff when people go all in now come to think of it looking around my house my wife decided to set up a whole graveyard out in the front yard\nOh\nActually with really good until the wings sort of blowing off a little ... graves blue into the neighbor's yard\n[laughter] maybe I didn't think it was nearly funny but I Do share those obnoxious or be seen these things that they make noises you walk by or if you make a sound\nIn reactions ghosts and she's got one where it looks like a dude hanging upside down like a\nSkeleton hanging upside down um but almost like a Walking Dead type body it's not like a skeleton and it's like a good looks like a zombie hanging from his foot with close still on and he starts moving around [laughter]\nIt's funny at first and then it just becomes a noxious because that's all you hear\nAll day all night I had to shut it off I lose it done disparate shops\nBig on these costumes more than half the people are going to cost more than a third will throw or attend a party and the spirit shops are begging these costumes they pop up in your neighborhood and they make a ton of money four hundred dollars a person\nStarts with Joe Marburg California you can thank California for starting this trend and the first Halloween spirits door open Nineteen eighty three Castro Valley ...\nIt was a spin off of ... first retail Ventura was women's ... excuse me spirit women's discount apparel or the early spring stores were a mix of regular women's clothing interspersed with wigs makeup and superhero masks the company was sold dispenser gifts\nIt's grown to more than Thirteen hundred stores\nThe brick and mortar stores closed in November second but ... you can buy from their website you around which makes cents lower over it\nOr when they do close spirit begins prepping for next year by activating their field agents to scout retail locations and make short term deals with them they look for spaces that typically size out from six to ten thousand square feet\nThat are near other retail giants like target and Walmart they hire they train seasonal employees over the summer they filed their district managers to New Jersey for a week long training meeting I didn't realize you can have an entire career\nIn Halloween you really can get you that means you can really have an entire career to almost any holiday how come the guidance counselors never told us that in school you said that when you're guidance counselor in about you but I said my guidance counselor I had a couple of things I Want to do what would be an actor\nA guidance counselor said that's a hobby and I said I Want to work on radio and the guidance counselor said there's no money radio so far my guidance counselors right on and everything it's all my guidance counselor I wanted to be a ... agent\nThey said you're too fat\nTypically given my guidance comes there was on and a lot of things true story my guidance counselor also sidelined\nIs a belly dancer one hundred percent true couldn't make that one up wouldn't be able to pull that one out of my ... that's a hundred percent true [noise] uh but I didn't realize that my guidance comes or could have looked at me and said do you like holidays I got a career for you [noise]\nDisparate sort of a thriving because some big box retailers are not one real estate consultant says that some money is better than no money and there's a lot of vacant big box stores out there that are otherwise sitting vacant right now obviously it's not as good as a permanent lease but it's better than nothing so there's relatively little downside\nSo all those are all those mall stores that are going under it was a prime location three spirits source to pop up and the malls go you know what a couple of months red is better than zero month's rent\nBlocks that kind of reporting as a temporary stores typically pay more rent the long term tenants the leases are usually six to eight weeks long those stores are vacated by November fifteenth of the latest in why spend all that effort on a physical stores that are just doing everything online retail consultant says\nThe big thing for retail stores that there's a sense of discovery there's been a treasure hunt mind set that goes with it like\nI Want to decorate my house but I don't know how I'm going to decorate my house so I Want to look around to be inspired\nDoesn't mean that businesses\nIsn't going to the people are going online to do their business but they say it's a category that lends itself particularly well to a physical store plus you got the hours for last minute shoppers\nSpirits open seven days a week some stores closed at eleven some of the uh party city Halloween stores close at midnight\nI my eyes were opened as I started learning the stuff I told them you know we should do something for Halloween is fun friday night\nI mean we've been dealing with mail bombs and civility all this kind of stuff is a must have something a little more fun more relaxed Hollings coming up it's a fun holiday it's talk about Halloween stuff and he says how about the spirit stores and I said I mean what is about the spirit\nStore she goes there's a story to be told no idea no idea what goes into these things that actually dying retail markets are\nGround for things like temporary spirit stores or [noise] I think are going to see more of this I think this is a threat I think they're setting the\nTo the houses the people that had money and they would [noise] would knock on the door\nAnd\nThe wealthy people would give them soul food not cool soul food but soul food\n[noise] I thought that is wild man\nThe the soul food that they were sold cakes basically pastries and in exchange the people that received the soul food were they said well we'll pray for your your deceased relatives and then like every great tradition we decided let's make the kids are all the work\nSo parents that are sending their kids around saying go get go get all the ... and let us know what we're supposed to pray for\nFantastic when you think about it right\nGreat great labor laws really that we are being violated at the time so young people are taking part in this it was called guy using putting on a disguise right that was ... so they were putting our costumes and then taking offerings from wealthy people and they say will pray for the dead they sing a song\n... tell a joke or they would perform some other sort of trick before they collected there treat fruit nuts coins that kinda stuff whenever ... or so cakes\nSo the trick or treat was not like a prank\nIt was more like a magic trick so trick or treat will give it really is trick and treat like I'm going to show you a track and you're going to give me a tree and I'll pray for your dead relatives that's how that all got rolling isn't it weird\nI think that's great and somehow we we just screwed it all up [laughter] it was just thinking all we all down this\nPath where we turned it into devils night and we started getting weird about it triggering the United states as far as like the kid's going door to door or it was sort of going on here and they're different places it was actually the early Nineteen fifties where it became ubiquitous\nOr the great depression exacerbated a problem with um with people being mysterious\nPranks became the Halloween activity of choice by the Nineteen twenties for rowdy young people sometimes the mounting to more than a hundred thousand dollars in damages every year and major metropolitan areas do the math on that a hundred thousand dollars back then you're talking\nMillions today\nAnd I don't know if you have seen any of the the reports if you remember the reports from the eighties the documentaries and things like that\nIt was an issue in some major cities especially Detroit where the the pranks the the devils lake I sort of hand they were burning down massive buildings warehouses
