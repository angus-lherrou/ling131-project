remember ... they already do too yeah okay All right about now plenty of parents\nAre taking precautions on reviewing the candy hall their kids have gotten taking precautions short for for for for the down yeah all that you will do it because they want some for themselves yelling\nAbove others will do so out of safety there is still the story of someone somewhere saying something about some neighborhood with some family whose kids were hurt by Halloween candy yes either by razor blades or even the newer version laced with marijuana depending on what state you live in\nYeah so I mean who wants to give away their their ... candy yes that was too expensive to be handing out to kids as a prank yeah there's there is some logic that that somehow escapes when coming up with these stories\nSo there's a guy by the name of Joe best he is a researcher on Halloween candy contamination so there's a guy this is the guy\nAnd he tells locks dot com I've done research and I can't find any evidence that any child has been killed or seriously hurt by any candy picked up in the house in the course\nOf trick or treating my view is that this is overblown you can't prove a negative but it seems unlikely okay\nSo how did this come to be yeah so modern day trick or treating really started post World war two running around that time Halloween was usually celebrated by teenagers on what they would do is they would do mostly pranks\nSoul but after World War two they said well let's make you more about the kids so when that started to turn so began the warnings of potential harm to kids\nAnd it started with the tail that someone would not just hand out candies they would hand out heated pennies from a skillet [laughter] now that's pretty owner is I've never heard that one\nYeah so but you know it was the fifties and they had a stove top so they probably did that way so somebody is handing you candy with pot holders\nOr don't take it right or they probably have like a little tin can they put the heat of pennies in there and they should get out or something yeah yeah yeah I Would go into the kids have\nSo um so it's like that and then by the sixties that was poisoned and pins in candy bars than it was razors and others sharp objects\nAnd since Nineteen fifty eight there have been on reports of that type of contamination of candy\nBut Ninety five percent of them have turned out to be false yeah\nSo however however there was one incident of candy poisoning okay\nIn Nineteen Seventy four alright an eight year old died after eating picks he sticks on my you know what those are the ... sugar powders redistricting yeah yeah well it has some cyanide in it oh what the thing about this as it wasn't a stranger giving kids cyanide laced candy\nIt was the kids' dad was a kid that has something to get life insurance might\nOh good yeah well what a fine fine fellow\nRight and then what do you do try to blame a neighbor that didn't go that far but I'm sure I can go that later on but um so what why do this why come up with all these tales why try to freak out your kids are freak out yourself so researcher best says\nWe live in a world of apocalyptic\nScenarios here we are we think we're here we are actually around the mid term over here and yeah the the especially during this time yeah here we are we are safer healthier longer lives than people in any other point in history and we are constantly imagining\nThat this could all fall apart in a second\nSo I think that what happens is that the ...
