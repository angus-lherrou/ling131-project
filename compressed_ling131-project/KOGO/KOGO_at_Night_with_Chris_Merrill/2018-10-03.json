allow that Internet service provider to have more control over\nWhat you do and this\nIs an ongoing battle between individual rights and I'm a capitalistic rights\nSo is it beneficial for certain companies to ah to ... to limit your access your rights to something if it means that they could make more money\nIt's so\n... and this is always a really tough balance it is it's a tough balance the arguments that are generally made our egregious and ... rarely come to fruition so your arguments from both sides that are worst case scenarios and they're meant to scare you\nThe reason is that what they want to motivate you they want to engage they want you to be scared because if you're scared you act\nIt's one of the motivating emotions that we have is humans\nAnd it's unfortunate uh nowhere is that clearer than\nAround an election time you'd probably get three or four fliers in the mail every single day telling you that if you vote for somebody your world as you know it will come to an end there's rarely a there's rarely a flyer that shows up and says hey good things coming your way if you vote for me it's always\nIt's always the worst case scenario from somebody else if you will like this person your children will never be safe what if you were like this person\nGrandma's going to lose their prescriptions\nAlways that's what it always is that neutrality is no different but once tried to use the metaphor here you've heard of the information superhighway and the Internet came so let's just imagine that the Internet is\nA road right you're driving down the road you bought a car now you can pay a lot of money and get a sports car that can go really fast or you can pay a little bit of money and you can drive a jalopy that doesn't go quite as fast but it still gets you there\nHey that's the way it works right now that's it\nNo open road no speed limits you pay more for a car that goes faster you'll go faster it's it you pay for a plan that has a gig in that speed you can fly it a thousand mega second course you never actually gonna get those speeds but that's what they sell it\nYou don't want to pay as much you don't travel quite as fast maybe we're just getting access on your phone you've got an old three gee a cricket phone whatever it is doesn't matter you're still have access the Internet\nYou still go that fast that's what we have right now so you control your own destiny and where are you going with your sports car where you're going with your your jalopy that's your business [noise]\nWouldn't that neutrality revoked now\nImagine that the car manufacturers have they each have their own wrote and\nIf you want to go someplace that's on somebody else's road you're out of luck so let's just suppose that you want to\nYou want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I'm trying to oversimplify this on purpose All right so you will get in your Ford and you drive down your Ford road well when you get down on the foreign road you end up with the peanut butter store a peanut butter now I just need some jelly I'm Sorry\nUh the agreement that the peanut butter store has with Ford won't allow them to sell jelly\nIf you want and jelly you're gonna have to go over to the sprint road\nBut you can't actually get on the sprint road because they don't allow for done to the sprint road yeah sorry okay just give me a loaf of bread oh yeah that's on the Chrysler road so but you've got some really good peanut butter\nOkay but I don't have bread and I don't have jelly yeah\nI mean you could get those but it's like instead of a dollar for a loaf of bread is going to cost you twelve dollars but your bidding butter super cheap and it's the best [noise]\nMeanwhile there's guy over on the other side who's sitting there with a jar of jelly who wants to put that on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich he ... he can't have peanut butter or bread but it is the best jelly and he got a really good price on it but if he wants peanut butter he's going to have to pay thirty two dollars a jar hey that's how this works\nNow or that's how that's how that's the fear that people have that you take away net neutrality and he would send device companies to make it easier to get access to certain things because they work out deals with the peanut butter store where they were gonna deals\nWith the jelly store but now that they've got the jelly you can't have access to the peanut butter without paying a whole lot more right well let's say you want to go to McDonald's McDonald's is on the the ... road I Know it doesn't really make sense but just following me along at us now you want McDonalds does delicious\nBoy I Need some grief and trans fats given at McDonalds [noise] okay here's the thing only ... allowed to park at McDonald's\nOr I mean still go to McDonalds but you can't park your car there you'll have to go to the foreign parking lot which is a mile down the road and then if you walk back you gotta be Donald ... is the same price for everybody is just that you can't access McDonald's whether your car right\nSo now all of a sudden we start going well mine doesn't make a whole lot of sense and yet we actually have the scenario in a number of different places the cars to narrow it works out really well because that's exactly how it is at pet co you go to bed cove you drive a Lexus you can drive you can park I'm Alexis\nAlex's lettuce the clothes line flood is closest to pet co park you right across the street\nYou pay more for a high end vehicle you've got this luxury that's a that's a benefit that's especially you get it oh you've got the great parking spot don't drive that car well you're at ... park and go to a one of the other place a little bit further away\nThere you go we seen as we see this practice right now so then ultimately what happens is the question comes down to is it okay to do that when it comes to information is information a commodity or as information a utility\nOr

you get online you can go wherever you want and you have the same speed the only limitations on your speed are going to be a physical limitations your equipment the line to your house the modem that you're using\nA if you've got a route or in your house whatever those are your computer those are the limitations\nBut as far as access to it your access is only limited by or what you're paying for when your ISP now this is where there is a little bit of confusion\nThis notion of net neutrality a lot of people feel like well that and challenges you allow companies to charge different rates for different speeds they already do that they're already allowed to do that which is why you have different tiers could be\nYou know twenty five ... second could be fifty mega second could be a hundred

federal issue and that the state of California shouldn't be getting involved and that the idea that each state is going to create their own idea of net neutrality they said that's not manageable\nEarlier I use the the the comparison of the Internet is like a highway\nWell we've got the federal speed limit but every state regulate their own speed limits right so we've got that you can go ... was Nevada or was it Utah one of those two states the speed limit jumped up to eighty miles an hour it's pretty exciting a but for the most part your federal speed limit is sixty five\nIt was it uh\nSo now but but most states have jumped things up to like Seventy or in some cases even faster and in some very rural areas some\nSome wide open spaces out west here they're big they won't

law that will stop Internet providers from favoring certain content her website the deejay wasted no time filing suit to keep it from taking effect\nThe FCC repealed Obama era rules last year that prevented Internet companies from exercising more control over what people watch and see on the Internet\nCalifornia's law isn't the only state legislation on net neutrality but it is seen as the most comprehensive and identical bill has been filed in New York and Oregon Washington state and Vermont have already approved net neutrality laws tongue tied powers Fox News\nThe restrictions and the California law or go beyond what the restrictions war would net neutrality under the Obama administration has research has been limited now\nUm because they the FCC decided forget net neutrality we're

so\nI couldn't come on the air like I was trying to push the button I was ... there is no way\nIt's not on a a it's not on a a slider a potentially amateur it's not there's no volume control that we have it goes directly to the tower it it supersede every other thing in the in the chain of audio there was no way to stop it and I felt like the biggest Gruber\nI immediately came on the your rent everywhere and I said uh that obviously is an old alert to we are attempting to run a weekly test blah blah blah right oh I felt like the biggest Gruber but fortunately our station was not the one that we're sending it out to all the other stations would you what I'm my buddy there in Orlando I Can't I Can't even believe\nFirst of all I was a little bit surprised that they used\nAudio that had been the the air signal\nBecause that's the only thing is that if you're recording from the this is going to be a little bit ... if you're recording from the mixing board because like I just said it it skipped straight to the tower so whatever you're recording wouldn't pick that up through the mixing boarded would have had to come from the actual honor your signal while\nThe ... over the past

it off I Want to say it's the warning of the top one right\nThe warning means that there is an actual spotted threat so in the case when I was in Kansas if it was a severe thunderstorm warning that

was a tornado it meant that the radar picked up psychotic motion it did not necessarily mean that a tornado had formed\nIn the old days prior Doppler having the the advancements that they did and and

of those courses so I could I could be a weather sponsoring forgotten everything now but\nUh I went to one of those so that I could watch for the formations tornadoes and things like that or a watch
