church you administer polygraph test remember just last week we were talking about validity of polygraph test when we were talking about he said she said in in Washington\nAnd a lot of people say wait a minute the polygraph test that was administered in that case to a doctor forward but how how valid was it wasn't really a couple of questions asked nobody was allowed to review the polygraph\nAnd uh and they said it wasn't administered by the FBI we have no way of of validating the polygraph itself\nSure they said that she passed the polygraph but what was asked how is it asked who asked it they said well\nOf course then it goes into other conspiracies of a it's all a hoax this didn't happen so and so forth but that's beside the point talking about the validity of a polygraph test is legitimate is why courts have been accepted polygraph tests in the past because a guilty person can pass a polygraph\nAnd an innocent person can fail a polygraph\nIt the\nThe certainty at a polygraph is is far from a hundred percent that's not to say it shouldn't be used as an investigative tool it can be very helpful it can send the investigators down the right path it can\nUh uh it can\nSend a message to investigators at the passes there on may not be the right one\nBut that also doesn't mean that that ah that you need to go with an overzealous investigation into one person because of a polygraph result or that you should dismiss a particular um suspect because of a polygraph result so hearing that a situation where sixteen years after the last investigation now\nAnd as a result of everything that we've seen come up in other scandals around the country\nThe dioceses said okay we're gonna have a third party and external party do some of the investigating\nThe should've been done in the beginning and any accusations around uh what really any organization not even just the Catholic Church but any organization shouldn't necessarily be done with an internal investigation especially when the stakes are so high\nThat the group in charge of of um overseeing that investigation is the same group has the most to lose\nAnd that it calls into question a number of different things like conflicts of interest\nCertainly we know that there are groups out there that could administer an internal investigation and they would be up front and honest with the results others might not be so up front and honest especially the result of that investigation are sealed and they're never made public\nAnother\nCriticism that we saw from last week is that the investigations are we are done by the FBI was the oversight of the president who was the one who nominated the person that was being investigated\nAnd they said well that's not fair so you have people in in politics is the left in the right but we can set that aside when it comes to the Catholic Church it seems to me that we should be talking\nBut right versus wrong because the whole foundation of our religion and the and the religions that we have it in this country boil down to moral guidance not necessarily about a leadership on on taxes or leadership on a trade things like that it comes down to\nMorality one thing that we can all understand are some basic rights and wrongs there maybe disagreement on some of\nSome of the other perspectives on rights and wrongs the Catholic Church and largely ... very staunch pro life\nOr many people who are not pro life don't associate so much with the churches but there are certainly some within the churches that are also very pro choice\nAnd that would come down to things like\nUm the right to life versus a woman's a right to do she plays with her body right and we can have that debate that's a different conversation altogether but you understand that it it comes down to the different morals\nThat comes down to the perspectives on those morals with a church there are some things that are pretty right and wrong right\nAnd the ten commandments are pretty clear though shall not steal thou shall not live show not murder right so if somebody murders we would say okay that's wrong\nThere's no there's no wait a minute but was it in the interest of somebody else getting what they want or you understand\nWhen it comes to the the\nShelly said now you have a tank the blast ... of a a young person and intimacy that is something that we all want to protect as much as we possibly can\nThe innocence of youth if it's been violated by someone who's been in trusted with that protection is a major major problem I mean that is that as an issue that has\nTo be rooted out and one can't possibly say what I find moral upstanding person oh yeah but they may have molested somebody in the past no that's such a such a violation of trust\nAnd it's a violation of our youth that that's something you can say yeah but they worked a lot of weekends at soup kitchens so they made up for it no no it doesn't go that way and last month a fry offering deals case was brought before the dioceses independent review board this is important because it's\nA third party review board has been reviewing files a past abuses against children by the clergy\nAnd investigator says that new information calls the denials of the incident into question it's not clear whether the San Diego police department as been contacted rework the review board is going to determine if ... you can returned to ministry\nThe pope isn't necessarily blaming the oversight not blaming the the priests themselves is not exonerated them but he's spreading the blame\nThe pope is identifying the

vice\nView\nWhich brings us to who is the devil you have to understand that we're talking about religion and I know that religious very personal to a number of people so I'm not going to tell you that

and cam why I see the San Diego my\nMy morality not based on yeah maybe you don't believe numerous months now I Do a bike and I\nThink I think accountability is the number one thing that are in general in this country\nOkay so in that regard is it is it OK at all to say that\nThat ah we need to\nPray to not let the devil influence us because in doing so wearing knowledge than that our actions are influenced by a by a higher or in this case I guess lower figuratively speaking power\nOr an old oh the church and you're right the ... the he does say his prayer at the same time the church must be made even more aware of its guilt it's mistakes in abuses committed in the past a shooting in the present and in the past\nRight about that but he opens the whole thing by saying save us from the attacks on the line one of the great accuser\nSo ... ... e quite frankly saying uh the devil is leading us to these all these decisions and I I don't believe that no I Believe that we are influenced by our own\nUm desires our our ... so to speak and I think that it's up to us to to resist those things\nAre right but he's not saying that that we're not responsible for those that action\nIt in for he only if yeah influenced by the devil but he's not saying the individuals and the church are not responsible for them it's like he's not saying hey hey blame that guy with the horns and the pitch for a glamorous or\nIf he's not saying they're not responsible and that's how people are interpreting\nThat I I did I Am I guess I Am interpreting it that way because he was saying but I think\nHe is because if he's saying look you have to the devil is really tempting us here so I don't want the devil tempt us any more\nNow than what we're saying is that it's the devils temptations that are leading us to do things that we shouldn't want to do or that we shouldn't be doing rather than saying it's it's our own inability to fight off our own\nDesires he's saying that those desires were put there by by another power and I didn't read it\nThat he didn't say was put there by now the\n... and then what is an influence\nIn infer\nYeah okay so what is the influence then\nWhat will the influence is a is not standing up the vices or encouragement or leading down of a you know I I Am surprised that such a smart man you are you really\nAre I Know because because of the conversations usually go like this if you disagree with me then you start insulting my intelligence\nBut in ... in ... in limits on no no I'm well less than I mean listen I listen to lessen the Johnny I Know you're very surprising not smarter than what you think I should be no no I'm saying if if the if the deal is that the devil doesn't have any influence or if the devil isn't leading us up the devil is not to blame for anything\nAnd the pope is not saying the devil is to blame for anything that why would the double come up in the conversation\nBecause that that won't because because there's good and bad in the world and we are influenced by God and the devil or whatever the sang a guy with a pitch for\nYou okay so that double the devil is influencing things and I'm telling you I don't think that the that the double influences I think that comes from desires from within\nI Believe you it comes from desires within that are in fluid\nSo you're saying that the lord isn't able to influence us more strongly than what the devil is not why we end up making terrible mistakes\nIt's all ... we are given free will so yes ... influence left and right good and bad but\nOr a ... before
