S. automatically choosing native born citizen regardless of the immigration status of the parents so President Trump says he wants to do away with that so he was talking to HBO's news organization actually goes\nAnd actually it was of course because they want more viewers a leak the story\nCalled immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the practice and shit without changing the sauce chicken wing and executive order exactly right have you thought about that yes it was always told me that you needed a constitutional and that by\nNumber one you don't need that human lessons well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order [noise]\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in as a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits tree they kill us as ridiculous and it has to end the process it allowed\nMe to clarify something here briefly or even the a P deleted a tweet because they did not correct the president they quoted the president in a tweet and then they said you know what we didn't correct it and tell everybody I Know he's\nA at best mistaken at worst planet like we're not the only country that allows birthright citizenship most of the countries in the western hemisphere allow birthright citizenship Canada allows it Mexico\nEffectively allows it basically in Mexico you're not a citizen until you're Eighteen ... regardless of it I mean your entire lineage could be Mexican and you're still not a citizen until you're Eighteen you're ... you're a Mexican national at birth and then you attain citizenship done so basically\nThe same thing so\nThe other thing too is that simply because you've got an executive order that she does not mean that automatically gets applied what he does is it sets up a legal fight that ends up going to the Supreme Court\nAnd they're the Supreme Court would have to decide whether to stick to the ... century old interpretation of the fourteenth amendment\nOr if they want to treat the constitution as a living breathing document\nSeems like we had a couple of originalist just said to the Supreme Court did we not who low that the notion that the constitution is a living\nBreathing document that can be really interesting\nSo the question is why is this all happening in the first place why do we even have the birthright citizenship clause [noise] why is it why is been guarded for the last hundred and twenty plus years\nAnd\nIs

long has it been understood that if you're born in the U.S a U.S territory us soil US military base that you are a U.S\nCitizen well conversation today shift that is the president says he wants to change that using executive order ... suddenly we have an awful lot of people that say no you cannot change that it's constitutional\nThe question is is it so we called him the Byron Henry and he's\nKind of go to guy for constitutional separation of powers questions he's done a ton of work within the court rooms that at the federal appellate court level and he's also a signed often and found papers and brief the United States Supreme court and Byron to the question everybody has is can the president doing this\nBasically what I foresee is that it would have something which basically interprets or enforces the fourteenth amendment in a way that the explanatory clause that the end of the amendment after all those born or naturalized United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nWould be interpreted to mean I'm not subject to another loss jurisdictions or using the word jurisdiction to me not subject to the laws but basically subject to their sovereignty or they're or their citizenship somewhere else meaning people that have citizenship somewhere else at our subjects of that country\nDon't automatically converse citizenship on in this country simply because you're born here because you're technically still a subject of the foreign country that you're a citizen of that so that's\nBasically the way I think it would it would play out that's a strained reading it it does go against the vast majority of scholarship though there is\nSome technicalities and some views on the fourteenth amendment better reputable they're just in the in the minority on whether or not that's the proper application most people believe and the Supreme Court or a pond on this over a hundred I think about a hundred and Twenty years ago\nIn a case in which it was just determined that if you're born in the United states on American soil then you're considered a citizen of the United states under the fourteenth amendment\nSo would this be an opportunity I guess for this administration to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling from a hundred and forty some odd years ago\nOr to just put some more meat on it I mean obviously one of the benefits I find interesting and this is anti Donald Trump has taken such a whole but many on the left are actually looking at the text and the original public meaning of the fourteenth amendment it in my lifetime that's the first time many liberal constitutional scholars have taken that tact but in any event some good will come out of this because\nWe're getting a little bit more textual with respect to the constitution but you know there's a lot of meat on this it's been a hundred and Twenty years since the Supreme Court ruled on it directly um you know Congress has plenty of forty over immigration so the argument would be if anyone\nCould curtail this right so to speak it would be Congress through a law and certainly not through an executive order but one thing you should remember as being the head of the executive branch and control of the vast number of\nExecutive administrative agencies that have their hand in immigration is you can easily make it more difficult to prove birthright status if you're with a child of undocumented illegal aliens and so there's a lot of things you can do around the edges as the head of the executive branch with respect the\nRights being born here to aliens but certainly it seems very doubtful that he could just with the stroke of a pen\nChange what seems to be the majority reading of the constitution and that is that the constitution confirms that citizenship all persons born here and if that's the case and if the Supreme Court ruled that way obviously he wouldn't be able to retroactively or even going forward or take that right away\nByron you make a great point that you've got liberals who are looking at the constitution they're saying this is strict interpretation but then at the same time you've got the conservatives who are saying well living breathing document things have changed since this law was written so if it kinda goes both ways in that\nPeople don't seem to be clean any sort of consistency any longer seems to be all about this demagoguery or or the tribalism\n... exactly it's it's amazing that the President Trump has been able to one\nJust completely get people to disagree with their own principles in the past for when the President Obama was on a lot about the uh DACA orders and the immigration orders that President Obama signed and you heard the Republicans and conservatives\nCount separation of powers in constitutional law and principals conservatism with respect to the constitution over and over I was one of them by the\nWay sure I just think that Donald Trump mania on both sides have driven both sides a little bit crazy including some of what I thought were more principled individuals on both sides with respect to constitutional interpretation but\nIf anything makes people look more at the original public meaning in the text of the constitution I'm for it and for that at least I think President Trump is doing us all a service\nOr his dad was not a legal US citizen and even though his mother was doesn't matter who was born in Canada so he's a he's going to the Canadian citizenship the water's getting very muddied when we start throwing in examples like that\nWell they do get a little money but let me just say that that whole argument benefits Donald Trump\nIt doesn't say anything in the fourteenth amendment about citizens being born of citizens in other words to citizens have a child when they're in on vacation in the Caribbean or than Nell or wherever they are they have a child that is legislation Congress has\nWeighed in on citizenship by virtue of birth so in that respect it at least helps Donald Trump in one respect means it's not all constitutional ... meaning there is recognize that Congress can\nTweak citizenship and citizenship is not only limited to those born or naturalized in the United states otherwise\nJohn McCain couldn't be president right he was not born in the United states he was born in the military base overseas but he can be a citizen right despite the fourteenth amendment so\nIn that respect that's where there's some play and whether or not this is all constitutional but even if it's not all constitutional I think that's where the door slams on President Trump because then I Believe it becomes legislative meaning a matter for Congress and not an executive order so unless he's just talking about changing submitted trading rules to make it very difficult\nFor children of undocumented are illegal aliens to prove their citizenship\nHe can make it much more difficult maybe even shave off some benefits that aren't bestowed by Congress butter bestowed by agencies on these people\nBut otherwise I don't think he can revoke the rights of that would take it minimum legislation and possibly even a constitutional amendment\nIt's

come\n... immigration is such a policy would also like to point out that we are not talking about a a plate bombers a mailing pipe bombs to a political adversaries we're also not talking about

may use executive order Paul Ryan this to say\nWell you obviously cannot do that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nBut he also left the door open for other talks\nYou know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [laughter] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process but where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is um on check illegal immigration\nOther say they want a better life instead of earning five bucks a day regardless of safety or economics\nOr you have this common sense of desperation in these two groups both caravans one that's in Mexico the one that just left Salvador but for those migrants who want to reach the United states the reason that they give to U.S officials\nIs going to be very important why are you here if you say it's because I Want to make make more than five dollars a day you're not getting in\nIf you say it's because I'm being hunted as a result of this tattoo\nYou many given your due process and an opportunity to talk with a an immigration judge and and plead their case for asylum US law makes a big distinction actually between migrant seeking asylum in migrants seeking better economic life\nIf you are born into a crap country I'm paraphrasing the president a ... that sucks and we highly encourage you to do whatever you can to change the dynamic of your country\nUh but when it comes to us being the world's police we are not unless you have a lot of oil\nSo find some oil and get back to us but if somebody's trying to kill you we do tend to open our doors we do tend to say All right we're gonna make sure you don't get eradicated the U.S is going to listen to migrants who are looking for asylum\nOr because they feared persecution from their government\nPreventing the care of and the fear is the gang violence and their government not protecting them from that violence\nIn many of these countries I don't think you would deny this that lots of the violence actually comes from the corrupt governments it's a mess so what we're left with here in the United states is that when somebody comes and says\nI Want to claim asylum we have to figure out how much fear of persecution from their government applies to these migrants\nExcuse me you\nKnow the migrants come up and they start sneezing like that you're out of here pal 'cause you're obviously bringing the bird flu when you're done [noise] my apologies now for people who are looking for a better economic life a lot of them tried to cross illegally if they're caught than they are denied getting legal status in the United states\nFor ever so they really are left as they come to the United states if they get all the way to the United states we're seeing that the that first care of and people are starting to peel off and take the opportunities that they're finding in Mexico\nOr if they're given the United states that would make a decision\nDo I take my chances and try to run through the the us court system try to do things legally\nOr do I take my chances and just try to hop across the border well if you're coming into the states and he tried to do things legally and we don't let you when you can try again if you try to but if you think you stand a better chance by simply jumping across the border if we can't you you can never come back you are never even given a\nSecond look you can't come back and say asylum we don't we caught you\nYou don't get to do that that's the way that shakes out so despite the odds you've got Central American migrants they're taking their chances and traveling hundreds of miles in the thousands of miles to the north trying to get here now the messaging around this is\nConfusing is confusing because\nYou have to you have to weigh the reality of things\nVersus the politics of things and there is no doubt that the immigration issue is a strong issue for conservatives and they've taken the lead on that uh people reasonably say look if not practical for the United states to try to take on\nEveryone who's got problems from every other country we can't we can't actually a handle that sort of pressure on our system we can't do that it's just not it's not a it's not a practical or pragmatic approach we can't do that\nAnd it's not unreasonable to say look we have to have some borders and we're gonna have some borders we have to figure out how to best make sure that the country can can handle the people who are coming across the border immigration policy basics right\nNow this is where your immigration policy matches up with your economic policy and of course politics plays into all of these different things but then you've got others that say if you don't let somebody and then you are an evil person I don't think that's true either\nI don't think it's true to say you didn't let somebody in your racist you didn't love somebody and ah so you hate America or you hate people\nUm you're a nationalist you're a you're a you're a bad person can't say that on the other hand if you're somebody who's saying oh sorry the cartels trying to hang you buy your toenails from a bridge\nA tough but you're not getting my Starbucks kind of a bad person that's why we have a policy in place right now that's why we have the immigration policy that we have and I'm not saying they can't be tweaked and can't be improved upon but that's why we have a policy that says if you come here and you claim asylum and you're from a country that has known corrupt government\nThat has a history of violence there is a there is a solid chances you really are feeling persecution in their own country why we have immigration judges but the messaging on this is very confusing because both sides\nThey wrote a number of different estimates is how many people there are some say that the numbers range from as low as three thousand all the way up to fourteen thousand the problem is that there's no real concentrate a group of people you've got\nA long string of people but it's kind of a hodgepodge so troubled their own pace some faster than others stretch for miles at a time and then\nThey're relying on humanitarian organizations in some of the locals to help them out food transit medical assistance when they get to the border border patrol has for decades been set up to round people up in the deport them they're pretty efficient\nBut most of them were single adults and the numbers that group has declined a lot now you've got large numbers of people whose families are unaccompanied minors which is a group that the border patrols not designed to facilitate the processing of a large number of\nFamilies looking for asylum and we don't have a system that's\nBeen arranged that way [noise]\nThe United states if we refused to offer a silent it would violate international law so if they make us sick at present themselves legally and an official border crossings reporter boundary say they fear persecution that gives them an option to um go through the screening process and
