I'm not going to let you get close but I'm really nice I just need somebody to understand that I care or\nMaybe you do but I'm not willing to take that chance\nSame thing happens whenever we talk about mental illness one thing we don't want is for somebody who's who's feeling a mental illness in some\nForm or another to avoid going to the doctor because of this social persecution well if I go to the doctor in and the doctor tells me that I have a mental illness something as mild is depression or anxiety\nSuddenly other people are going to think that ... he might be dangerous because other people with mental illness have done harm\n\nAt the same time we can't not identify what could be some underlying factors right we cannot\nIgnore or some of these different types that are out there I don't want to stereotypes us not fair I uh we can't ignore some of these other characteristics that are common among people that do us harm you all do you have any friends that because I've got this\nI tend to be attracted to people and I don't know why this is [noise] but I tend to have a lot of friends who are socially awkward but I think are genuinely good people yes I Know many of those people are very well yeah\nI've got a few friends best man at my wedding growing up great guy\nHad real trouble talking to people he just he he came off as being awkward or he was heavy kid when he was in high school and and he had the acme in this kind of thing and\nAnd his father was alcoholic all these different you know sob story while blah blah\nBut this guy had the I I just genuinely liked him he was a genuinely good person ended up being a he's a he's a fire medic now he's great guy does you know he saves lives for a living any overcame a lot of the social awkwardness he figured out\nHow to talk to people but people didn't want to befriend him because well especially in high school you're weird right you're weird but if you see the goodness and somebody and you can draw that out can you help yourself by feeling good\nBut you you give them a new lease on life there is no downside to it but again the underlying characteristic for me is I had to ... I had to feel that they were genuinely good people\n\nDescribe wasn't it maybe that's why he was a loner [noise] maybe couldn't attract people because he was not a good person inside maybe his social awkwardness was\nIndicated not have an underdeveloped ability to communicate but rather an underdeveloped empathy for humankind\n\nAnd then the downward spiral began New York times talked to a gym ... this was a childhood friend is is a Pittsburgh shooter and Brent ski so that when they were teenagers or they would do pipe bombs and blow of watermelons he says that the shooter was in his own little world\nThe two drifted apart by the time high school came around and and the shooters or junior year\nYour book there was no mention of any activities are sports if he took part in in his senior yearbook didn't even have a picture of him most of his life the shooter thought was sort of much like a ghost he was there but he didn't really make any impression wallflower if you will\n\nHe was a commercial truck driver hit one bedroom ground floor apartment he started Twenty one\nUh guns legally purchased didn't break any laws one neighbor noticed that he will be gone for days at a time but when he was home sometimes they say would just sit and his car smoking listen to the radio I\n... that doesn't seem really all that peculiar to me ... you know if you're in a one bedroom here this is a pretty logical explanation right you have a one bedroom ground floor apartment\nAnd you don't want it to smell like smoke so you go smoke in your car and you turn on the radio when you relax maybe your cars more comfortable than the other hand me downs so for you got to not outrageous has not weird\nSometimes I sit in the car in the driveway just to hear the the guy on the radio finish up a story if they're doing a good job I Want to hear the rest of the story I'll sit in my car for five or ten minutes it's not strange\nThey say that he paid his rent in cash directly to the landlord and he would use the PO box instead of the mailboxes of the apartment complex again not strange lots of people are PO box is\nLots of people would rather dealing cash Ben put their money through the banks a lot of people don't trust banks that doesn't make them an anti Semite although it sounds like the anti Semitism is probably why this guy didn't trust the banks but that doesn't make somebody weird because they prefer cash\nMaybe they don't like going into debt so they don't like using cards maybe they're concerned about identity theft so they don't like using the Internet or a transmissions of of money it's not weird man one of the neighbors live next to the shooter for two years he says\nI Wish I had known what was going on in his head I wish there was some sort of warning sign\nI agree but being an individual is being a a bit of a loner being somebody who makes their own way and doesn't feel like they need to constantly be validated by people around them doesn't make somebody weird\nWhat we have a zero tolerance policy for people that don't tolerate us [laughter]\nOkay [laughter]\nIf you go then it's like a little bit about what this shooter was posting on this gap dot com [noise] and that vigil are going on this evening in Pittsburgh [laughter] if we coverage try to give you complete contest as to what's going on without getting into the left right they said she said he said nine\nSo [laughter] so what it's about while in the same thing [noise] America [noise] his radio six hundred Scoville [noise]\nHe'll NATO that first of all ...\nHeld Tuesday for the victims that Saturday synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh President Trump heading there tomorrow he tells boxes the anger mangled\nWell I'm just going to pay my respects I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and some of the people that were so badly hurt so that I really look forward to going\nThe president's been getting some criticism for not knowing sooner but he says he wanted to avoid creating any disruptions manning case of sending more than a dozen pipe bombs to critics of the president in court today Caesar say ac appeared\nTo be alert and coherent often talking with his three attorneys even cracking a smile every now and then when called before the magistrate say I think knowledge is Miranda rights but then as attorney asked the judge for more time to confer with his client in Miami and brown Fox\nNews ... court on friday\nThis report is sponsored by the auto club of Southern California\nThe evening or something on the Ninety per each family for twenty eight feet that to stop it it looks like they're getting it over to the right shoulder\nI've seen a little bit if they've had it on a Wednesday between north and it hadn't up towards the eight oh five from an earlier crashed there are also our hearing about that a little something at night it's on the magnolia avenue at Santa Fe hiring drive the roadway is black there with a serious crash fill a void that area if you can't\nI'm Cathy motives with a look at case on air traffic 'em\nJoin the conversation on Facebook and on Twitter at cocoa radio [noise]\n...\nGo to and it was radio six hundred cocoa ...\nThis guy posted on Gabby dot com [noise] gives you some insight into a man who eventually would grab is firearm and head into a synagogue [noise] so this is what went down in Pittsburgh [noise] this guy was on this gab dot coms dot com is\nAh the Web site that was put together for people who basically got booted from Facebook or Twitter for being too crazy I'm the guy who started it told buzzfeed news this is Andrew sore but he told the bus or the news\nWhat makes the entirely left leaning big social monopoly qualified to tell us what his news and what is trending into defined what harassment means it didn't feel right to me and I wanted to change it\nAnd give people something that would be fair and just [noise] so basically people that were posting a gab dot com could say anything they want it to\nA there's a there's certainly an argument for that uh\nBut when you're talking about the other social media outlets Facebook and Twitter and these sorts of things remember you've got publicly traded companies now and there are shareholders they have to answer to an shareholders want return on investment and return on investment comes from advertisers and advertisers don't want to be associated with\nA with a outlets that are pushing ... hate speech now the government's not going to censor hate speech but so other private companies can censor hate speech on their platforms absolutely can't\nOh so this guy says he doesn't like that it's not fair\nOr so the shooter goes on this gap dot com and on his bio page you said that Jews are the children of Satan\nMany references a number of fourteen eighty eight\nA\nThat is a fourteen idiot fourteen is the the fourteen words we must secure the existence of our people and the future for white children\nAnd eighty eight is um [noise] that's a neo Nazi symbol eight eight a ages the AIDS letter of the alphabet so eight eight is like saying H H hell Hitler so fourteen eighty eight basically a way people are great Hitler was cool\nSo\nHe posted on his bio but then when you start reading some of the things that he posted\nHe he goes down his own little dark hole\nWashing posters and in February he posted a medium of a monopoly chance card\nThat had superimpose images of Trump dragging Hillary to jail than in may he wrote that he did not vote for Trump nor own or ever even worn a mega hat so you've got a number of a Trump supporters where you've got Democrats are trying to say this is Trump\nIn terms of saying this guy actually said he didn't like Trump\nNow\nWait until you're and find out why he doesn't like Trump wait so tiny for just a second for people to say he doesn't like [laughter]\nYeah because here's what happens in America today is like it's either you're with me or you're against me and so the assumption is if you don't like Trump you must be a liberal Democrat this guy is certainly not a liberal Democrat but he also does not like Trump wait until you you find out why this is\nA see what else to write a white hello their highest you like to bring hospital invaders did well among us we appreciate the list of friends you have provided high says the Jewish organization that was founded\nA hundred and almost hundred and forty years ago that helped Jews fleet Eastern Europe it's a a an immigration group two thousand the group expanded to help non Jewish refugees escape from other parts of the globe and that list that he was referring to was a three Pittsburgh congregation that were participating in helping refugees\nDoing unto others yeah do do that are\nSo last week Sunday he posted his thoughts about the migrant Caribbean coming to the United states\nHe said and you've heard this sort of thing the mainstream media as well not in here don't confuse mainstream media with liberal owned media I mean high circulation media when I say mainstream I mean high circulation okay\nUh usually says I've noticed a change and people saying illegals that now say invaders I like this uh he believe that the people in the migrant caravan were violent because they were seeking refuge from violent countries\nAnd he was he was ready and he left and he went and he started shooting because it was five minutes later\nFive minutes after he posted I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in and he did walk into the tree of life congregation squirrel hill you began shooting\nSo coal started coming in the nine one one right dispatchers transmit out what\nI can only assume is the last thing anybody or one of the last things in a way that any officer ever wants to hear active shooter tree of life synagogue fifty eight now you're Wilkins avenue there is an active shooter in the building there being attacked there is gunfire color is going to be on the third for one person down so far\nThat\n[laughter]\nOut anywhere [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nSheltering of [laughter] [noise]\nI just want to stop for a second and just know the clarity the seriousness but not the melodramatic\nTone that some people would put with a call like this that dispatcher was great\nHere is what it is here are the facts you deserve seriousness we're not going to be overly dramatic unique just the facts not delivered in any sort of way\nWe've received these coals there was agonized breathing I'm very few colds since police have arrived on the scene here is the latest is that goes out over the radio\nThat person or\nWhoever that is a dispatcher did an amazing job and I don't know if they're compartmentalize and the reality of it with their job and they know how to separate the motion and they just kind of figure oh cope with emotional this later but they were amazing\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\nMethodically going through the synagogue for and the dream deal way reports one of the basement what's the status here's the Erie that we've cleared phone magazines years old when Suzie we found blood working problem trying to find\nThe victims and find who's\nWho's gone who can be saved who's in hiding all while they're still a guy intent on killing people on the loose this went on\nWith officers trying to search the building and and find this shooter in Pittsburgh this went on\nFor almost another hour in fact it was more than an hour so SWAT Team showed up\nPolice but again the phone call when nine one one at nine fifty for a um police arrived shortly thereafter\nCordoned off the area prevented anybody from coming and going down this does avenue SWAT Team shows up at ten forty seven and they head to the third floor of the building\nThey don't engage the shooter he opened fire on these SWAT Team officers trying trying to breach\nThe same time period including ... year round application if changes are consistent with federal\nLaw so\nWhat does that mean this is where the lawyers can get a little\nBit um monkey\nHere's one just because they say that they could change it as long as it applies a federal law about the deal is this federal law doesn't allow for California to start monkey in with the time zones doesn't allow it you've got the uniform time at All right that's the federal law the uniform time act\nOr basically says here on the time zones everybody don't go to daylight saving time the only reason that you could change is it lays out a couple of provisions basically this is the whole state has to do it like Hawaii and Arizona right\nThat's it says everybody observes daylight saving time if the state lies entirely within a time zone or the whole state then would have to do that or if the state is divided by a time zone boundary the exemption would apply statewide or to the entire part of the state that is on one side of the boundary confusing\nYes consider the little piece of a North West Indiana Gary Indiana total crap all there is a portion of that that is central time zone that little portion doesn't change\nRight it it oscillates back and forth\nBetween daily say excuse me does not isolate actually everybody else does it stays consistently in the central time zone so when central time jumps to daylight saving time it actually goes to the eastern standard time this is confusing I Know eastern standard time actually jumps out of the Atlantic standard time okay\nSo that little portion because it's part of the other time zone can do whatever it was so the whole state of Indiana doesn't have to observe it but that little piece of Indiana can do whatever they want right that's the way the federal law reads right now in our it's California you can't just go deciding that we're gonna have daily saving time start in July and and in\nA December right that's the deal that's the way federal law reads so in order for ... seven to make any changes three things have happened\nOne they would have to pass this bill that's the first thing just doesn't pass to worry about it again to\nIt would take an act of Congress than to repeal or replace the uniform time act that would allow us to make changes to our time and do whatever we want with the with the daylight saving time\nAnd then three it would take two thirds of the California Assembly\nA incentive to agree and then the governor would have signed a bill right there is not what prompts seven does it gives permission from the people\nTo change the daylight saving time arrangement that we have in California if the feds also give a permission right it's basically the first step and getting permission\nHere's why it's better to become the way that they have this written right now it says California's Pacific Standard time\nBut we might go into daylight saving time and make that are permanent daylight saving time the problem is California if you go to a permanent daylight saving time you're actually mountain standard time so only really done is change time zones instead of saying we're Pacific time\nWith the daily saving time now you're saying where mountain standard time period right there is an issue there and that issue is\nAll of a sudden somebody traveling from a Utah to California\nThey would have to change your clock back and forth it's gets really confusing especially if you're in some tighter places where let's say that you're traveling to Arizona or\nActually got Utah well say you're driving through your top but you have to cut through a little bit of Nevada and Arizona to get to Utah all of a sudden you have to go for mountain time to Pacific time back to the mountain time back to ... from from mountain time to Pacific time depending on the time of year because of Arizona you could end up back in a Pacific time and then go forward into\nA mountain time again for clock changes over a short little drive now that might be just a funny cork an inconvenience for us but imagine interstate commerce that can create some real habit\nAll of a sudden you've got people going through Vegas that are going wait where are we\nAre we we're west of California you know you're still use of California you're just in a time zone that's west of California if they want to do this correctly they're going to say that California is Pacific time zone and they're going to say that\nWe're always in Pacific time zone not were always in mountain time zone I can get a little bit deeper into the\nThe vocabulary in the language and why this really is a a bill that changes definitions I think it's going to get challenged simply based on the fact that it's a bit vague a reasonable person would be confused at\nPacific Standard time is the same as mountain standard time but it's not even though the bill says yes it is it is now that's where I get a little bit lost but that's not to say that this isn't a good idea\nBecause the bill would allow for the state to manipulate the daylight saving time we could go to permanent daylight saving time but it would also allow the state\nTo do away with the like saving time not technically the state can do that right now they just do and why because we passed a bill in Nineteen forty nine said we're going to do it the way we have been ever since then more in this next Coco at night [noise]\nThis report is brought to buy on bound died or\nWe have a serious crashes than as sweet water road at Harrah's shot it looks like God's black when south bound lanes of sweet water and they're needing to get somebody in there to clean up there there's a the ... we can avoid that area that might be
