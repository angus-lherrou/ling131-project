public vote coming up on that and the all the new neighbors and everything actually San Diego Chris there was a report or the Senate was holding the top ten to worst neighbors in the country well that's what I find that to be shocking\nWell\nI don't know I mean the thing is with all these reports it's a little bit cautious the reason is the survey twenty five hundred people in two dozen towns so that's the equivalent of about a hundred people\nSo let's suppose that it was a hundred people who were neighbors with I don't know immediately on\nSo all of a sudden you've got a hundred people to go yeah my neighbors awful\nAnd I understand why they would say that but if they were say your neighbors jak they might come back and say well for me that's so nice of soda if they weren't early on I'll say that they were a Maryland's neighbors they'd be like there is no place I'd rather be hammer she is the best\nSo you have to be a little bit cautious with these studies but uh it is curious that you you bring in the uh the vacation rent well\nBecause how do you even know you've got bad neighbors they're gone and three days yeah right so good point you have to be a little bit cautious too when you when you got a survey of a like a hundred people in town it really is depending on where they are\n... and it really could be somebody that they surveyed in CPB who does have\nA some neighbors that are you know moving through some different vacation rentals versus somebody who was a little more um long term in their in their property and wherever it might be so it'll be a little bit cautious but it is something that we should pay attention to and we want to make sure that we continue to be America's finest city\nAbsolutely right I Will Chris real has here this evening seven

you have one that looks like this if you do cool\nI mean should she stopped me from doing it I don't live there should she stopped me\nSo like you said if you look like a homeless mail um that could become a classes if you're right I mean we have certain perspective about individuals that look quote unquote sharp because they didn't why certain beauty standards and I don't think classes for

prejudices classes and racism or sexism whatever it might be ages them you know if I saw that I ... this is this is as close as I can possibly comes in when I was a a teenager anytime I went into Wal Mart falling around by security 'cause they thought I was gonna steal something\nIn his Walmart so I mean one of the steel just whenever I can return the next day and get a few bucks on a um so\nI I hear you but do you just let anybody in the building that I mean what's the point in having a a key pad\nAnd they can come in because we're we don't want to engage in any sort of discrimination\nWell I mean we we started by letting the people and who knows that the ... had a\nWell that's the thing is he didn't tell her that he knew the code he didn't he he refused to share it with her than he knew the code\nYet because he he's not he doesn't have to do that he's a he's a human being paying rent to live there he had a key\nBut how does how does she know that she doesn't have to know that [laughter]\nBut my point is if she opens the door and I looked like a homeless guy should I be able to come in\n\nAnd is it is it to her to be a police officer\nOr I don't know but I think we all have a responsibility I don't know I don't know where you work or where you live but you know I've lived in buildings that have had um keypads and I at the building here we've got a big sign in the back door this is make sure the doors locked 'cause you know safety you people are radio stations have been shot before it sucks but it's the truth [noise] um\nSo I mean there's there I think there's a certain individual responsibility isn't there maybe I'm wrong\nI ... and again so that when we're talking about the individual responsibility right there's there's so many layers of prejudice\nOf ... a young that that come with that come with that that same notion though that's what I was trying to get to earlier was that in this in this in this instance I think it's pretty obvious that she was pretty aggressive with blocking off the door faceless\nNow and go home right so what what what can come out of\nThis as a learning lesson right he turned his key in in the lock in the door and went went to where he lays has had on every night\n[laughter] why not after she that's right and as soon as he did she was like Ben she'd done quite frankly if there's a point where she sounded a bit racist as when I was like oh well I just wanted to say no and introduce myself no you didn't lady\nI'm with you on that I saw it right through that scam okay\nYeah but that is when she left Malone although she didn't end up calling the police which I think it was bogus you know what's really going to be honest with you so much really appreciate that uh when you're I'm Jeff Gordon Jeff up on the news radio six hundred total Jeff\nGuy first of all sit in a race issue [noise] you know what you should have done are closed gate said dude if you can get in here and you got to keep you use I live here I don't know if you do or not [noise] secondly\nI'm sixty six years old people today do not have gotten their hearts by and large and you don't know what they're up to\nSo you have to treat people that to me that you don't know you treat him politely but you always treat him with a little bit of like watching them because you don't know people are up to\nSan Diego where I live I don't

giving you a hard time just actually told me it was you know you have to figure I'm here to ah Alex military inch Alex\nHey how's it going oh it's going it's interesting I I agree with the\nThere isn't I witnessed limit trying to break in anymore so she quite frankly could have been far less aggressive ... he could have simply said I live here and my name is it's nice to meet you that didn't happen either Jackson oceanside jak how do you read this mud\nJak jak there we go\nYeah I was fired by her employer I don't know what the follow up is on that one yeah I I was like oh ... yeah\nUm I look I I think this is a classic case of the principle of stand your ground and that's what he was doing and under that profitable you don't have to retreat now for this not to be racist I think that she would have to have some kind of history of challenging people coming into her unit\nWell wait a minute wouldn't that be presuming her guilt and then forcing her to require she prove her own innocence\nWell it was entirely correct shed no authority to stop him or questioned him\nAnd the fact is is the same principle with the Trayvon Martin case that you you had somebody coaching Trayvon Martin who had no authority to do that\nAnd uh and so you can make the argument the Trayvon Martin was ending his ground that case that got killed by you know I'm I'm just saying it under the principles stand your ground doesn't have to retreat didn't so kudos\nTo him she does she might have to retreat though because here's the thing\nWas she the aggressor share with all your grocery store\nAnd he was exactly correct so I'm just saying if she's not a racist is there are other incidents where she is challenged papal\nDoes imply hang on Jack Lennon liberal or a train of thought though is she being aggressive if she's standing her ground on on the property of her building\nWell because in her mind he's trying to he's trying to gain access to her property right in her ... her belongings so in her mind she's standing her ground well\nUnder the under the principle of stand your ground you you have to have a thorny to stand your ground and and he has the authority to enter the building 'cause they live there she didn't have any authority to stop 'em or questioned him so she loses that argument\n... and like I said has she done it to anybody else well I don't know if that's relevant\nBecause you have to have a pattern and practice if you don't then it looks like she's singled out a black guy looks races and that's why that's why she got fired\nWell could we could we also asked the question has shown that there's been say a black woman that lives they're just trying to shut him out before you\nKnow he he doesn't have to do anything it's just trying to go to where you live\nYou know he was he was like I said the principle of stand your ground was clearly on his side and under that principle you don't have to retreat so any\nBased jak appreciate them in
