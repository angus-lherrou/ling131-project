course you have people that were in the majority class white\nUh specifically white males that went wait a minute what now I'm being penalize because I'm white which is why certain portions of affirmative action of been struck down in the past however has been eliminated completely\nAnd that [noise] [noise]\nThat is really where where we are in America today when it comes to the the current status of this affirmative action critics say that admissions or hiring practices should go to the person with the best qualifications not necessarily because they're from an oppressed group and they should get that work\nOr that admission into the university based only on\nMerit others say wait a minute affirmative action [noise] ... that\nIt's set up because the hard work that you put it in the

person that came out of the inner city\nLook you weren't really hard I'm Glad you did and it sucks that your school isn't as good as my school but that's the way it is\nWhy should I have to go to a lesser school now\nHow does that benefit anybody how is that right\nIt's good arguments all around I understand both arguments on this\nAffirmative action is going to be argued one more time this time in a um a Boston federal court room and the focus this time is on Harvard and the reason Harvard comes up is because Harvard has employed this affirmative action\nUh although it's not necessarily for a disadvantage group instead they're looking for that diverse mix they're trying to make sure that their admissions are bringing in a a a large swath of big cross section that is representative of America\nWell the problem is they have is that predominantly\nThe Asians applying to Harvard have higher GPA's higher test scores higher\nMerit and now you've got a you've\nGot Asian saying wait a

merit and you've got the Asians going wait a minute ah my merit is much higher than there is why it might not getting a second look\nIt could have some major implications for schools across the United states\nThere is a mess and the myth is that Harvard is a very uh elite school and they take a bunch of people they don't they really don't take very many people at all we did the research on it\nAnd

[noise]\nSee the group is represented the Asian Americans who were rejected from Harvard\nSay that the schools methods are discriminatory the premise is that they use personality traits when assessing

however\nOther factors like we talked about earlier that Harvard has been using things like integrity and courage to create their diverse student body but when it comes to diversity\nThere isn't a
