look at that uh and then it was an irrigation gone wrong we had a rogue killer ... that were um Mm suspected of having killed him and then the latest if you'll recall was the fistfight no\nI'm not

to make it look like oh no he definitely left\nIt is a rat workable fallible for us to believe this require such a suspension of disbelief\nThat there's no there's no the people are saying well there's skepticism or the international community is skeptical\nThey're skeptical their flight I don't believe it doesn't make any sense at all and you might have said that you might as well as some of those guys somebody's unicorn into come stab people with the horn and we would have been oh yeah that makes perfect sense come on\nA and so the international community is very upset by this and United States is known a really tricky spot a civil dive into what kind of a position that puts us in we've got the intelligence officer no foreign affairs expertise going joined us here seven thirty as well to tell us what it means\nAt least then we'll just know that I just Americanized the hell out of it instead of just embarrassing myself okay three weeks now it's been almost three weeks\nThat this whole deal\nWith the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey has created this international start the circumstances over the ... disappearance of this is a journalist in the conflict in Turkey catching international attention if you'll recall when this first happened it was\nHe was kind of a paper Seventeen type story and it slowly worked its way up is this as as time went on and it became more and more evident that one he was gone too it sounded like this member meant was what's happening there were rumblings up dismembered minutes after about a week\nAfter two weeks we pretty much knew what had happened and now I think Saudi Arabia is actually admitted to the fact that they dispose of the body\nThe foreign minister is a a do as you beer and he talked with Fox News algae beer says that this entire deals to be blamed on a security team at the consulate\nThe\nThe Saudis don't know what happened to cause showed shaggy\nAre or where his body as they say oh we don't know all they know that he is that he was killed in the conflict which is a marked difference from what they said initially which is oh no he left everything was cool now we have a big question\nAnd the international community is not sold so far on\nI'm hearing for excuses because these excuses continue to shift and the big question is do the Saudi crown prince know about it\nThe Saudi king old pretty ineffective the country is basically being run by the crown prince there [noise] this is again it's the middle east where\nThe the strongman government\nHas a a tremendous amount of power obviously strongly and ah but in other places where there's been disruptions from the strongman government there has been a great deal of chaos and this has been one of the criticisms of\nThe handling after the Iraq War is that once we oppose Saddam Hussein created this vacuum created a mess\nAnd they say well you know you need a strong man who's going to to really put his foot down and and clamp down on people if if you're going to maintain the order between the different factions of the theocracy\nWell\nIf somebody is sanctioning these horrific murders though that goes beyond just a strongman that turns into

tremendous mistake made and what compounded the mistakes would be the attempt to try to cover up that is unacceptable in any government these things unfortunately happen\nHere to tell you the hoops my bad is not satisfactory\nOn the international stage maybe that works in some of the different Middle Eastern countries and this is where some of us have a real difficulty understanding what's going on is that it's such a completely different world\nThat oh these things happen [noise] they don't happen in the western world but they may happen in the middle eastern world and to them no big deal\n[laughter] the problem is they did it to a guy who they are as Saudi exile who is working with one of the largest us a press organizations\nAnd it was also a guy who was I'm a bit of a dissident when it came to the crown prince himself which creates a world of suspicion from a country that I opened the segment telling you\nIs long fought as being one of the top sponsors of terror\nAnd yet\nWe have this tenuous relationship with Saudi Arabia because they are our doorway into trying to curtail much of what goes on in the middle east\nBut Barrett are asked the question of this I'm I'm a Saudi Arabian foreign minister or listen to this\nTremendous or do you understand the skepticism um that this was somehow a fight that develops inside the conflicts and a sixteen year old columnist writer is going to resist a Fifteen member security [noise] and that one of the members of the team was an autopsy specialist [noise]\nHow do you sweat\nThat's I don't believe all the members when\nWe're looking at the German team\nI don't care if all Fifteen members were not in there a sixteen year old do doesn't pick a fight with one a trained assassin from the quote unquote security team just doesn't happen\n[laughter] they're trying to find out how they are symbol there was this\nWhat happened in the ... what happened\nWe have said without seeing these as the initial results and not exercising the Haitians and lived to pursue this to the end in order to uncover the truth and make sure that\nEverybody knows what happened and we have to know who's responsible and we hope for the towns\nYeah do you get the feeling like they're going to pursue the truth that we'll except they keep throwing out these different theories or no he left he must have just disappeared in his own he must have gotten cold feet\nOh uh no it was an interrogation that went wrong well who was interrogating and why oh it was a fist fight that that\nThat got out of hand so we ended up strangling him to death no I Am eagerly awaiting the next bogus excuse to find out what it is\nRemember the show he goes in their quarter after one and a little bit after three o'clock in the afternoon everybody's on their way out the door\nTurkish ministers until now said the authorities have not shared audio recordings with anybody on the Turkish officials saying the ... body may have been disposed of in a

show geek and prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSo who is prince NBS born Nineteen eighty five August got a bachelor's degree in law at king Saud University in Riyadh\nAnd be appointed special advisor to his father who was the governor of ... out of the time and in January twenty Fifteen his father became the king whose father was Seventy nine NBS then was made the the defense minister and a couple of

Chris Merrill and we've been talking about the latest unbelievable changing story out of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey\nWhere a judge I'm also sure he was a we're hearing now that he was murdered we we've known that for weeks but now officially we're hearing that he was killed\nUh this is beyond anything that's for me to be able to comprehend or even explain so I I I thought we called Tony she Bruce or intelligence officer\nOf foreign affairs terrorism expert this guy knows older is to know about these uh these circumstances\nSo Tony thanks for being on the program and trying to help us get to the bottom of this what in the world happened with the Washington Post reporter I think it's safe to say he's gone and we may never see his body again is that is that a fair assumption\nYeah of course that Graham and yeah I think it's safe to say is a dog and I mean God and pieces unfortunately and let me just say this a lot of Americans don't understand the Saudi Arabia is a whole the way they approach the world is not a western by any standard I mean let's be clear here\nThey still had people they consider a lapping off people's hands of the form of corporal punishment totally acceptable [laughter] so ah you know this within their scope is nothing really new\nI think the only new thing here is I got caught their issues with the show was guy I'm and I'm not sure if I'm Out and I was in his ... his name correctly there I'll do my best because it was that he was doing and saying things will show the real family didn't like and he had a fairly substantial audience so\nYou know look ah we know other dogs are more mentioned by name\nA tend to do things directly I mean I have no doubt that who has been behind the rash of assassinations and things like that too so we cannot afford to project our standards on them I'm just saying that I'm not saying this next case I'm saying they do things differently that's we have to accept that but we do have\nTo understand it's what our role can or should be regarding the accountability no matter how we see them about what their standards are we can't accept journalists being called into a Catholic and chopped them but that's not really a\nThat's not cricket ah so I think we do have to to to really account for what happened but at the same time they are an ally a when you work with them as a most are against the Iranians\nAre they've come a long way regarding supporting one of our key allies the Israelis are there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes where there's mutual support so I I think ah unfortunately this is going to be a very complex set of challenges and it's not going to be solved overnight\nIt is it would be really easy for me to go down to the political path a Trump the crown prince that putting this I'm going to try to stay away from that but I Do know that this closely in her we with the geopolitical scheme [noise] uh so if we if we need to make mention of of names or or need to talk about advice and we'd we'd give political leaders and we can do that\nBut when when we when we see what happened was ... I mean again I'm slurring his name see probably even worse than anything I probably should just stop even trying um ... the the changing\nExcuses from no he left here everything's fine to uh uh it was ... and going back to a rogue actors to a fist fight where he accidentally died\nHow in the world is there any credibility from anything that's being sent by Saudi Arabia at this point we can't even if they were to come forward and say yeah we chopped them up into bits because he spoke out against us how we were supposed to do that's true\nAre you are right and and this is again them being a what they are they don't like admitting when they get caught\nTime for gas to get the recognition they deserve their role in influencing pop culture public opinion introducing the on her radio podcast words live in Los Angeles January the Eighteenth\nFormer twenty different categories the mode on ... now and you're automatically entered to join us in person for the first ever I heart radio podcast awards\nVoted my heart pump gas towards\nLines around the area you see hospitals go going on a three day strike starting tomorrow morning American Federation of state county and municipal employees\nPolitical three ... thirty two Ninety nine gives me upset about outsourcing now if you already have an electric procedures scheduled camps will be there to help you but new appointments or not being given this week [noise]\nWhen they served their worship down when they came home there was no place to stay in now the shipping is coming full circle for nearly two dozen homeless veterans will be the first to occupy shipping container homes in Logan heights\nSink the developer sponsor places is tiny homes for people who have fallen on hard times after after sacrificing\nFor the rest of us banks into a pony Schaffer who really give some great insight into much of what's going on there with the with the ordeal in Turkey involving Saudi Arabia and the the journalist is\nSuch a complicated mattering and quite frankly\nThis is sad to say but I think that our attention span is not such that we want to spend a lot of time trying to comprehend all of the different nuances of an international I don't want to say crisis right now but said development ah such as what we're seeing going on there in in Turkey\nIs very complicated it is very tenuous it's very delicate and I think uh this is going to be real test for this administration meanwhile the administration is doing like every ... administration before it has done it is out here the the couple of weeks before the midterms stumping for\nUm the uh their party the Republican this case a\nPresident Trump bows out loving all kinds of accusations I didn't realize that there were riots today in California did you know about the riots today California ill ... part of those riots real riding I was no Z I'm changing my car\nWhat riots oh there were riots everywhere president sets up but they were writing about sanctuary ladies in California yeah you didn't get the memo no yeah yeah well it must happen the president said so [noise]\nYeah the president was also saying something that I asked a Tony Schaffer about there at the end of the interview and if you miss it you'll want to check the projects out after um after we posted here when the show's done\nAnd that is uh what about the idea of I'm going to say Trojan Horse basically in this uh this caravan of people coming from\nA starting in ... their way up through Mexico now Mexico to their credit is actually tried to stop many of these people are but they've not been very successful as the Caribbean continues to make its way toward our southern border\nUh our\nIntelligence expert makes a point that there have been safe houses established a in northern Mexico by different Iranian support groups and the president says right in the middle of these this care man you're gonna find middle middle Easterners but that that was a very curious way to say that because it sort of\nIt plays on prejudices doesn't it it doesn't say in the middle of this group you've got a kind of or Taliban or or ISIS is says you've got middle Easterners\nWhich I think you have to be careful that rhetoric like that because it\nStarts to ... I'm not going to say racist but it's racist or what it does is it starts to create this prejudice against people who are from the middle east across the country while the president says middle Easterners yeah surely there are probably people of other nationalities\nAnd there may be some bad owned Braves within that group what's difficult is that in a civilized countries such as ours we don't want to regress\nTo the point where we start behaving like these different countries that we oppose so vehemently we don't want to start acting like Saudi Arabia where we throw the baby with the bath water on the other hand the other adage if we can have battling cliches\nIs that one bad apple spoils the Bush All right so what do we do this has been ongoing question when it comes to the southern border for very long time about what you're going to have here is you're going to have the battling political rhetoric\nYou're going to have a President Trump is going to say that you've got to stop it build the wall stopped the stop people from coming in 'cause they're all going to do do you harm\nAnd my goodness MS Thirteen middle Easterners they're all going to steal our jobs\nAll these other fear that is\nSort of drummed up then you've got the other side that claims nothing could possibly go wrong we're a civilized nation which we are but that doesn't mean that we have to be ignorant nation so how do we accurately bet some of these different groups and this is really the multibillion dollar question\nThat goes on there is one point though that I [noise]\nI hesitate to bring us up but [laughter] but I feel like it's a point that needs to be made\nI don't want to come off as conspiratorial but when we see an influx of migration from the south it's come during the summer when the president first took office there was actually decrease now all of a sudden we've got this Caribbean coming up now all of a sudden\nYou know we had to suffer from earlier this year no we've got another wave at a time that we have not seen waves of illegal immigration in the past normally this is the time of year that starts to kind of tapered taper off\nBut the president is the president has stumping\nThe latest polls showing that Republicans may lose control the house\nAnd suddenly we've got this massive of people trying to escape from Honduras and make their way up to the southern border rate is in the mid term elections are coming the timing to me is suspect\nThe timing to me is very curious when it comes to immigration the passion to the credit of of the people in the right belongs to them the people in the right are far more fired up about the\nThe border wall than people in the left are let's say there is a passion on the left but they don't have this\nThis ah this [noise]\nSort of I don't say fury but they don't have this eagerness about the southern border if people in the right to do [noise]\nIt's not as big an issue to the people in the left as it is to the right and so all of a sudden [noise]\nWe've got an existential threat\nRight before the midterms are coming when you've got the group is the strongest on this particular issue that is showing

with that other school shooting witness seven month follow ups twenty five percent of the seven hundred and sixty nine students who work\nOr who weren't even makes them genders and races and socio economic backgrounds reported clinically significant levels of stress right so now now we get a little bit clearer picture of this study the study was taking it one university\nAnd they're saying that it was twenty five percent of seven hundred and sixty nine students so less than two hundred students at one of the largest universities in the nation that's the sampling that we have\nThat's it\nYeah it goes on to\nTalk about why they might feel this way the most severe cases were seen among women black and non white Hispanic\nStudents who were forty five percent more likely to field is rather twenty sixteen run between Trump and Hillary Clinton wait a minute women black and non white Hispanic students it also goes on later to say that the non Christians were more stress held the Christians were\nThese people were more stressed out by the winning of an old rich white guy so is that a surprise is does this come as a shock that people who didn't vote for Trump\nWere stressed by the fact that Trump won I ended up I did a a um an election night broadcast twenty six thing and\nIt was with predominantly Republican or supporters ranging from traditional Republicans to the amped up Trump's base Republicans\nThey were in a state some let me say that somewhere in a state of euphoria when President Trump won the sort of celebration you don't see\nA hardly ever I mean it was like they were ready for a kicker tape parade there is no juxtaposition of this article that there's also no constant\nSo we don't know what the norm is for people experiencing raised level\nThe stress after an election there is no understanding of other demographics other age groups anything else like that it's just\nWe did a study of less than a thousand people at one University in a predominantly red state to determine how they felt and we talked to minorities in a red state to see if they were stressed out after Trump one\nI thought this is the most bogus beer study\nI could imagine and mind you let me make this point to\nThe study was not done by Arizona State the study was done by San Francisco state\nUniversity who studied Arizona State university students coming from a guy\nWho still oh San Francisco State University a sizable amount of money 'cause my daughter went there from one year but ... before she said I Can't handle it\nThey're crazy here\nMy daughter's pretty liberal and she couldn't handle San Francisco State University because they were too crazy for her\nSo [noise] how are we to believe any of these studies any study we got a real problem with studies\nAnd the fact is we throw out the word study and certainly we believe that there's some sort of academic or academic academic a credulity behind them there is very little academic credibility when it comes to this particular study in fact the people in San Francisco State University ought to be ashamed\nAnd how this article was written and if their study is no more in depth and what the article states they ought to be ashamed that any dollars went to putting on this bogus study\nThey ought to be a shame that it was published with their name on it\n\nWhy you have to be very cautious and why I think it's the most important so we checked the credibility of every study that we not only read but especially those that we use in our arguments or during part of our our discourse with our colleagues or co workers are friends and especially on line\nThis study that says studies don't count in just a moment\n... night news radio six hundred Togo\nThis report is brought you\nBuy stand up to cancer eight
