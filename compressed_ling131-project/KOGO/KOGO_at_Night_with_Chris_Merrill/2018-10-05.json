Netflix series really bugs me\nTerrible smell ... some of the clock so did I go to a diet go go do size six fifty five\nI'm alert I made the grace of breaking primaries now an FBI agent open the front door of an Oregon home activating a booby trap\nWheelchair that shoots him in the leg homeowner Gregory Roosevelt now charged with assault on a federal officer\nNew York state officials reportedly investigating allegations of fraud at tax evasion against Trump and his family business the Trump deny all allegations to Massachusetts boxing coach Robert ... calls the cops when confronted at his gym by an outrage crowd\nAh so what they said as we gotta make sure all the Republicans are gonna vote our way and if they do world and\nIt's the same thing that we've seen when it came to the health care\nOr the Affordable CARE Act and in that case it was a we will remember McCain's thumbs down right but it wasn't I Believe Collins and Murkowski were the other ones that said uh that's a no go so McCain was kind of the one that people went oh which way he's going to go\nWell in this case you read ... Murkowski that are sort of on the fence and then you know Jeff Flake of Arizona senator or who\nSays I'd like to know more\nSo really this entire thing we already knew that the Republicans had whatever was forty or eight votes right we knew they had forty eight votes and we knew that the the Democrats had their forty nine votes\nSo it was really down to three senators and if you had somebody like Joe Manchin crossover because he's a Democrat out of a red state in West Virginia then the Republicans would think right that's just that's just icing on the cake that's\nA that's a security vote for us but they had to make sure that they got Murkowski Collins and play if they can get like a a mansion to flip over then they would be able to offset say a Murkowski who says she's not going to uh to to pass it\nOr we don't know where she's going to vote now we're going to find that out probably tomorrow and then of course final vote on Saturday tomorrow's was really the big one that preliminary vote is going to let us know where things are going down the final vote is going to be on Saturday it's highly unlikely\nThat anybody who votes one way on friday is going to change their vote for the Saturday ah the final vote\n[noise] uh it's just kind of a\n... it's just so weird parliamentary procedural things that you have a preliminary boat and then a final vote basically you're voting to vote\nThat's it do you vote to vote on this yes I Do okay great\nWell it sounds like Jeff Flake feels more secure in a yes vote he says there was nothing in the FBI Files that he saw that showed any new corroborating evidence as far as the accusations against judge Kevin I'm\nA ... basically said the same thing Susan Collins from Maine\nThat's the two votes that they really needed and even if Lisa Murkowski the other one who was sort of on the fence votes against judge Kavanaugh that's a fifty fifty split and Mike Pence the vice president offers a tie breaking vote\nAnd I think we all assume that he was going to vote a cabin in for a couple of reasons first of all that's his administration's nominee a and second of all ideologically they're actually pretty close to one another\nUm obviously they're going to have some differences on different issues but they're ideologically pretty close and so I think there's probably somebody who would like to see 'em making some decisions and are planning from the bench for very long time\nNow the mass the math as we see it any way seems to be in the Republicans' favor right now\nWe'll talk with John ... hearing in just a few minutes ... is a I'm a political analyst in ... in San Diego and he runs a dating an associate's in in John's of really break I Love having them on the show a so will sort of hashed out and find out exactly what he sees if he sees them at the same way as I Do or maybe something else is going on\nUh I Do want to make mention though that we're going to have a chance to talk about the op ed that John Paul Stevens is put out\nSaying he does not think that cabinet has the temperament to be a Supreme Court justice and then cabinet basically responds fires back says yes I Do and um this\nI Believe capital is probably going to going to be a a controversial figure for his entire time on the on the bench I'm hoping for the sake of the country that we can move past the episode of the last two or three weeks here I'm hoping that we can move past that\nI took it can be very difficult and it will be interesting for us to watch and see how this affects not only the mid term elections but other elections going forward in if this cabinet issue is going to be used [noise]\nI I feel like the Democrats are probably going to try to use this and the Republicans will probably hangar hats on this for a long time to come uh we'll see how does that guys to the rest of the country sort of fuels any sort of advertising of propaganda for either party a pressing forward\nIn the meantime it looks like the FBI investigation didn't really turn up a whole lot of new evidence then of course you run into the other question and that is which is really a thorough FBI investigation well\nThere is another issue we are going to be debating for a while and it really comes down to what is special presidential investigation ... news or any of six hundred Toto\nToto data news radio six hundred Coco which are of course meal as we continue to talk about the FBI investigation wrapping up and what that's gonna mean joining me now is one of the great political analysts of Southern California's\nJohn dating from dating an associates and John as always thanks for being on the program how does the FBI is\nWhat we understand his non findings or how does that to impact the midterms because as we all know the sort of the the dirty little secret about this this uh nominations in midterms it was all about midterms right I mean the the ...\nThere's local uh absolutely yeah and uh what about the ... the race for with Duncan Hunter is that it is that tightening up or people sort of excusing the investigation going on with him\nI wouldn't use the phrase record scares in ... but I Would also to answer a question directly say tightening up yeah I've I've always predicted that or he would win\nThis election two thousand two in the general electric uh I think that's a state in pretty good pretty solid with a little bit over thirty days left to go but then again uh also predicted a because I've read that forty eight forty seven pages of the indictment\nIt is so solid it is so specific that is so detailed I think that\nUh within two years after the November election probably within six months I think there is a good chance they'll be conviction or or ... resignation which were trigger a way it works in California is a special electrical by the governor\nAnd if that's the case then you would see some of the others that were running in the primary bright that would jump right back into it\nActually you know you see the what I call it relatively small field that was in the primary you would see a large field because\nA lot of people such as ... on some groups councilmen mayors people play any wars et cetera that normally didn't run for Congress because they would have to give up the street they ... the Congress is up every two years so they're never going to say\nThe special election everybody in the region would be in the states so I think you would see a very large feel of a lot of elected officials in is people forget the ... district goes far up north in San Diego county it's not just in this kind of despair and more so I think you would see a very large grilled\nFascinating John it's always good talking to you I always feel smarter when I'm done I'm speaking with you a great insight and it's always in a nobody I'd rather hear political cliches from the new my friend\nAnd a one last I'm supposed to be smart enough not to make predictions but [laughter] so we're back to predict your nightmare during the presidential race before Trump actually were sworn in and I always said whoever between president\nTrump or Clinton I always predicted that in the first term the first forty years there were three if not for but there were three Supreme Court nomination so we're our number two right now so let's ... viewers were bad\nAfter ... ... deaths and who's the next one in lied I think he's got a good list to choose from and I do think it's going to happen\nAll right John dating dating associates with chicken news is Chris Merrill is just go to a night news radio six hundred pogo [noise]\nFox News on Carmen Robert words of support in the Senate for judge Brett Kavanaugh from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley\nThis person has very well qualified a person that believes in the principles of due process the presumption of innocence and readiness to serve our recognize\nThat that's not how retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens sales even seen previously supported Kevin off on the high court now says the nominees combative and political performance in the hearing changed his mind charges continue to pile up following the boss of a mass Philadelphia drug ring\nThe three top members of the infamous drug trafficking organization or now facing a whopping six hundred and eighty nine charges and all fifty seven people have been arrested to date as part of the so called Alameda drug ring that allegedly dealt in heroin fence and all and cocaine ... grams then Fox News [noise]\nHe\nJoined the conversation on Facebook and on Twitter at cocoa radio\n... minutes Chris Merrill news radio six hundred go go and go go at night [noise] uh\nFriends friends friends the ah\nThe Kavanaugh saga will continue and it's it's even developed a since\nEarlier today we had we had a\nAn op ed written by former Supreme Court justice and the response written by judge cabin on Fox News and update\nI have a critical vote on the Senate floor Republican judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley made this pitch on behalf of judge Brett Kavanaugh to Senate colleagues\nThis person is very well qualified person that believes in the principles of due process the presumption of innocence and readiness to serve our recognize\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey is on the Judiciary Committee and its among the Democrats complaining the FBI didn't do a comprehensive review of the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nPeople are specifically named who were in the room\nAnd you're and you don't interview those people\nThat to me outrageous that the FBI would not interview those people\nOn Capitol Hill Mike Emanuel Fox News\nIt is a strange dichotomy that we have going on right now is it not\nBecause the Democrats have been backing the FBI through the special prosecutor in the investigation and President Trump but they've been talking about the intelligence community and how proud they are the intelligence community how much they support the intelligence community whereas\nThe Republicans who have consistently throughout history\nBeen very supportive of law enforcement at every level\nOr they're the ones who suddenly are doubting the\nIntegrity of the intelligence community\nWhich\nOpens up a couple of different um concerns that I have first of all\nA rather than supporting the intelligence community we have people who are supporting their party they're concerned that their party could be damaged and they're willing to damage some of the sacred cows that they've held up in the past because they want their party to when we are putting winning and in many cases we're putting the other side losing\nAhead of what we believed to be right and wrong we're modifying what is right and wrong in order to justify winning and losing\nThat is a major concern to me from a a social standpoint I'm really worried that that is going to continue to permeate\nAh it's we have this this mindset that as long as my person wins that I'm right this is very Machiavellian and\nPeople have been warned about this for years and we just are not paying very good attention to it we're not paying close attention and and suddenly we're allowing ourselves\nTo be manipulated um there's one thing about allowing your viewpoints to match rate it's another thing when you allow your viewpoints\nTo sort of waiver back and forth based on winning and losing right it's one thing if you feel like the FBI has become corrupted\nBut here's where we run into this issue where the Democrats are now saying well the FBI didn't do very good job well then how could you possibly believe anything that comes out from the FBI and the Mueller investigation and they're going to parse that they're going to say well it's different 'cause Mahler was independent from the rest of the FBI\nAnd then you're in a Republican similar find something on President Trump's something that's pretty condemning a year and a Republican say well the FBI has been out to get Trump says the very beginning\nBut here they are supporting the FBI when it comes to an investigation into into a cabinet so we've we've reached a point of paradox and\nWe don't seem to have any issues with modifying our own beliefs\nSometimes even in the same sentence\nIn order to justify our our teams advantage or to a line about uh teams disadvantage that's really concerning to me really concerning\nIncluding that Neal program St Paul's manner is an active living community if you're fifty five are older and you want a fabulous apartment close to the ballpark called gene nickel at six one nine to three nine twenty Ninety seven or St Paul seniors dot org retire right visit that scene in wide dot com\n[noise] hard radio is easy to use that for music and re\nDownload the free I hard radio wept today\n[noise] [laughter]\nAt a news radio six hundred cocoa\nPriests Merrill [noise] total oneself you pay your bills give me three chances every weekday to win a thousand dollars just those are the key word detect send your next chance to win a thousand dollars having six o'clock tomorrow morning right here on AM six hundred cocoa get all the contests times they'll cover dot com slash contests [noise]\nSo [noise]\nHere's where we are now this morning the Senate gets the FBI background investigation into cabinet now this was a supplement to other investigations that they've done\nFor everyone says the FBI isn't a thorough background investigation no the FBI a certain boxes that they check off when they do background checks but they don't go back and start asking everybody whoever had lunch with somebody in high school\nIf they knew the person did this person like Peter tops oh they didn't interesting check no no no\nThe FBI doesn't ... a check into things like did they engage in copious amounts of underage drinking no well the FBI does they say does this person that foreign investments\nIs this person been known to hold acquaintances with individuals that have ties to a new terror groups or things like that the FBI is concerned with national security the FBI is not there to tell us whether or not somebody might be a good or bad judge or whether or not they have the moral um\nWherewithal so the idea that the FBI is supposed to be ... doing all of this judgmental work is a misunderstanding of what the FBI does when it comes to these background checks the example I come up with is a buddy of mine ... mia to background checks one\nOr the first one was when they were dating she started dating him and she says I'm Sorry I Do is to you but if we're going to be boyfriend girlfriend I've told my boss and they have to do a background check on you and he just got a lap and said okay\nBecause look using love to try to leverage somebody is not unheard of\nAnd so the FBI is very careful about that and this person does a lot of investigating into especially international matters\nNow they had to do another background check when they got married again to double check and make sure that they ... and a ... well they didn't do is ask if uh my buddy they called me about it too they said things like you know have you ever seen him hanging out\nSomebody you know you know this has got to do that whatever it might be\nThey didn't ask me have you ever been completely ... with this guy on fiesta island during O. T. L. 'cause if they had\nI had to say yeah we've been totally shattered before during ... and it was a blast you know have you ever seen this guy do something inappropriate yeah he made a terrible fantasy football trade with one of the guys and I'm pretty sure they were looting against us\nI don't think that the FBI cares about those things right it's a little bit different so we have to understand that the breadth of an FBI investigation\nAnd to that\nWhen you've got judge Kavanaugh who came out he was very angry and a lot of people are excusing the self righteous indignation at the hearing saying well if you were falsely accused when you'll be angry too and the answer is yes absolutely I Would\nHowever\nIf you are not falsely accused but you were trying to pass it off as you were wouldn't you sane extraordinary anger\nYes of course you would\nSo that doesn't really tell you anything about whether or not somebody engaged inappropriate behavior what it does tell you is what somebody how somebody reacts to different\nUm circumstance is different scenarios and to that retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has some very strong feelings when it comes to rent cabinet no Stevens that was part of the liberal side of the court let's not forget that right [noise]\nI don't know if you're an Amazon Prime member but if you are then you know what I'm Talking about and if you're not a ... a share with you ... how this would be very similar to something you might experience already\nSo Amazon has Amazon Prime right Amazon Prime not only gives you free to day delivery on lots of different products but Amazon Prime gives you access\nTo music and videos you buy a prime membership and you get access to a bunch of different movies that Amazon has bought rights to\nA an access to the Amazon Prime original programming very very similar to Netflix the differences Netflix doesn't have a giant retail outlet in offering you free shipping to go with it right but imagine Amazon Prime it really got two sides one is that shipping part\nThe other side though is basically Netflix\nWell Amazon was trying to figure out okay how are we going to take these these movies we want to try to send somebody to our video that takes up a lot of space that is a lot of data to transfer\nNow same thing with Netflix Netflix started sending things out in HD Amazon has to know a that is a ton of bandwidth than a ton of data so how are they going to do that well\nThey were looking for a place that was advancing technology and such a manner that it was able to compress files\nTo be able to send them and then at the other end your computer or your TV [noise] be able to ah basically reconstitute those files to give you a full film in high definition or standard definition whatever you pay for\nA but do so without burning up a ton of bandwidth without burning up a ton of a a power and server processes on their end\nAs well as making sure that you didn't get stuck with a high data charges so they went to this company that developed as different compression software they would call that right\nWhich is Netflix uses compression software Amazon does Hulu does everybody uses compression software of some sort and they try to get the highest fidelity transferred at the lowest bandwidth that's it's been an ongoing challenge\nSo Amazon buys his company elemental\nElemental I'd come up with the software and their servers were able to compress video and send it off\nAnd it was working fabulously a elemental is based in Portland\nElemental needed great servers right they're using they need some high in computer equipment so they go to one of the top high in computer manufacturers as a manufacturer that makes computers and servers for some of the top companies\nAre not only the United states but worldwide\nThey make some of the best equipment out there they've got contracts with\nA apple Amazon with the U.S government they've got contracts with the biggest names in the biggest buyers they are one of the big dogs in the computer industry right it's called super micro so sick of super Mike Rowe\nIs a place that that that builds these different servers\nThe service might use components from say Qualcomm or you know one of the other companies\nThey are assembled however those circuit boards are assembled in China the circuit boards are put together in China then shipped to the assembly plant there's one in California the San jose area\nA and there's one in Taiwan one somewhere else to they ship them to those places and then super micro assembles on the dial up the specs that they want and then they ship 'em out to apple Amazon elemental US government\nA number of different places Canadian government everybody I mean these this is the top\nSupplier of server products\nWhen you buy an apple computer chances are you're buying well chances used to be they severed ties with him I tell you why is the second chances are are that if you bought an apple computer before twenty Fifteen\nYou are getting a super Mike Rowe circuit board for a super micro assemble machine circuit board that was built in China assembled the United states packaged by apple used by you is it possible\nThat China has figured out how to spy\nIn a manner that had once been fought completely unsinkable lord knows that the United states doesn't engage in this kind of spying because they didn't think it can be done why the president the vice president and the media are warning you about China's efforts\nTo not only alter elections but to get in on everything that we have going on and it may be playing into why we have begun to some of our trade battles with China will tell you about that and exactly what China did every checking your traffic of
