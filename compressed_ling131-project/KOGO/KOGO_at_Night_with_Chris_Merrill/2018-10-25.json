to a number of a democratic representatives or a a retired intelligence officers one\nLabeled um addressed a John Brennan via CNN and claimed to have come from\nA Debbie Wasserman Schultz numerous misspellings on that envelope there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered so it is in our best interest to call upon Wendy Patrick who was or go to when it comes to a terrorism counterterrorism uh and then the legal aspects\nOf of all these different things when you the question on everybody's mind is or who what where when and why and how I guess uh this one simple question six a little heavy I see what I suppose right XN\nParts right Chris this is it's terrifying for anybody that I mean forever they really they had nail delivered to their home their office if the ticket really disturbing as we have the holidays approach where you would expect packages arrive where you have children that might think\nSomething I write for them to make a lot and open something I mean this is a\nTeaching moment for everybody in terms of how dangerous it can be simply open your mail how sad is that that we're talking about this so you're right the who what when where why how much to what extent I guess this sort of follow\nAll of that those are the questions that are facing investigators and and attempting to answer this question you know they always works faster than we can talk about it at my predictions are always it should be a short amount of time before we have something to get leads we already are learning we've learned about commonalities between the way these were package\nAnd the type to um [noise] what they're going to be doing now it's going to the next level and looking for the types of forensic evidence that will be able to tell what they say there's a signature that's common to all of them can't retire at the chicken or\nGeographic location where they were mailed from your outlook at footage from post offices even things Chris like the fact that at least one of them had way more stamps than you would meet nail it took me like maybe you and I would do if we're not really sure how much a package ways\nBut not sophisticated criminal law laughs he or she is trying to mask the level of education that with the dog and appear like an amateur\nI mean did a fascinating question and those are that's what the investigators are tackling right now\nWhen you Patrick ... anti terror expert and um when do you make some great points about hiding the sophistication the letter to CNN had so many misspellings\nAnd so many blatant errors on the front of me were either talking about a real bold\nAnd we're talking about somebody who is really trying to to hide their own sophistication in in this case\nIs leading to a tremendous amount of speculation and I don't know why we need the ATF when we have the Internet uh it seems to the Internet has figured everything out already or you just have to decide which right wing or left wing blogs you want to believe a at what\nPoint do we chill out it sure seems like it's sort of this amp political rhetoric that's leading us to these events and then the same and political rhetoric is the\nPredictable response when these things happen [noise]\nRight you know the answer political rhetoric would explain the target selection in this case but in terms of the kinds of people that do this and the motivation you know it's both predisposition and provocation and that's\nHappened since the beginning of time when you look at the kinds of people that have done this and the reasons much of the time it's due to personal grievance so even if we didn't I mean surely would probably have far less of this and the climate in which we live because it's so politically\nCharged but people do this any way and you just amp it up as you said when you have rhetoric that so explosive so did it the that you do actually have that\nFeeling of fire if you will and\nAs you know there's been much coverage of the fact that\nOh well these were lower level bombed not if they explode in your face which is what would happen if you were to be opening this at close range as you would be to see what's inside and that's again why I'm just you know let's just warn listeners who have children who don't have children and make sure if you see a package from somewhere that you take a\nI don't want to say a close look let let's say ... and a book that is far enough away to be safe\nBut also that is smart enough to be safe if it's from a packet to package for somebody that you haven't spoken to in ten years maybe give them a call first that say hey to just send me something I remember the packages in this case that they came from ... he was in short sometimes there are these return addresses too many stamp red flags on the\nPackages themselves as you say misspellings is kind of like when we get an email and there's one word misspelled or if you have or over the return address and it's some mile long address and some other country there are clues we don't take enough\nTime to work through on the front end that with ... that something is that right here\nYou know the whole thing ... ... ... leaves me last and I think a lot of us are feeling this way how does law enforcement approaches because inevitably they have to feel some of those emotions we do and why why would somebody go ahead and do this but to me they have to take almost a political viewpoint of it in order to have an effect of investigation\nChrist that such an important point I'm so glad you raise that if law enforcement already thinks they know what they're looking for they're going to miss other evidence that's right into their nose it's the whole or if\nSo we've got that happen cricket cricket's right now in terms of who did it for a member of the air ... he was at Berkeley after like a PHD in\nIts history aligned ourselves well what kind of person that's capable of doing it it's not for me down and out of the locker job like a fairly it could be people from all walks of life in another reason that it is still important law enforcement on that\nRight now asking the right question because they're not in that would necessarily rule somebody out\nThere because they are what they achieved in life yeah look at more than that\nWendy where the best you always in late ... is a blessing to

doing is\nExacerbating the problem itself clearly something is wrong clearly something is not right\nFor me to give you a chance here after eight o'clock to to share with me what your thoughts are or whether or not the the tone of our discourse has has gone too far or we off the rails or have we become fanatics are when it comes to our our political\nUm rhetoric and our political actions\nFar beyond being passionate supporters or\nPassionate resistance to any particular political mindset we've turned into a brainwash zombies that believe those who are not of like mine's poses an existential threat so we'll we'll\nGo to the phones here after eight o'clock eight hundred six hundred cocoa eight hundred six hundred cocoa more immediately how do we fix usually with\nA male bombings the United States Postal service delivers more than ... one hundred sixty billion pieces of mail every year how do you spot you suspicious package Jeanette haystack\n... new piece of technology that uses harmless low frequency Tara hurts waves just scan for dangerous threats inside the mailboxes and inside the pieces of mail like bombs or anthrax or rice and its toll is called the tea cognition system\nAnd the researchers looking for a frequency range called Tara hurts it's like microwaves or an F. Amazon megahertz a Amazon killer hurts this is Tara hurts so your\nYour us all Asians of wavelengths are much more rapid they're low energy frequencies in ones that can penetrate a wide variety of materials from paper and fabrics through to a plastics and even more\nWhen I didn't get scanned different items absorb those frequencies and that difference corresponds with different materials so they can determine what those materials are based on\nHow the particular items respond to having those frequencies bounced off of them\n\nThat difference corresponds to different material and the computer figures out so if you've got a if you've got something in the mail and it's and it's hit with this that the terror hurts wave\nIt's going to have a unique spectra ... fingerprints that identifies a threat or something like illegal drugs and then it sounds and alarm and they can use this for all sorts of mail rooms ranging from companies in schools to prisons and government agencies and embassies\nThis is really amazing technology this is the sort of thing that not only can we use this on male this is a sort of thing with the military can find a number of\nDifferent applications for so it's not like I'm not I'm like you've got to you've got our radio signal coming into your home and\nWhen you go to certain places in the house that signal varies you can hear it right because there are certain interference the the signal reacts differently with the items within that vicinity oftentimes when it comes to a um it's it's electrical waves are FM similarly although a little bit different\nBut it's also why am can trouble so much farther at night it's\nA killer hurts as opposed to megahertz it it travels further because the distance from the oscillation same thing with terror hurts it em set up even further which is why we end up with a with these very low\nUm\nLow strength for the waves with pose very little physical threat but they of course have\nUsefulness when it comes to trying to determine what a particular material may be\nWhich acknowledges really fascinating and to see signs of technology come together to provide free safer environment for all of us is [noise]\nIs a relief it's really great [noise]\nThe tone of our discourse the gone too far eight hundred six hundred cocoa how do we fix it if it has stayed hundred six hundred coca cocoa not read\nHe's halo geo KM why I have to go live\n\nFull story's absolute fake news not I don't like that new so must be fake but I mean made up stories about pizza parlors running sex rings for the Clintons that take somebody who has a pre disposition to violent action\nAnd that's the trigger that's their provocation and they load up their pick up and they drive up from Florida and they barge into a pizza parlor fully armed taking people hostage because they are going to save the children\nThere I think for many of us\nAbout politics have become an exercise in entertainment a suspension of disbelief and you have to understand that when you watch the television programming you watch a movie it's the suspension of disbelief that draws us into these things\nWe do that on purpose and we know we're watching TV and when the show is over the credits run and we\nGo back to reality we realized that we were simply\nDrawn into his story literature great literature does the same thing that draws us in it puts us in these places in our imaginations take off and it's a wonderful thing until somebody decides that they're going to use that to manipulate our emotions\nFor their own benefit and we're seeing an awful lot of that of late or civil discourse is no longer about\nUh how do we how do we tackled the um the immigration issue in America it turns into a battle of who can make the other side more fearful and really it doesn't work it doesn't make any side change their position\nThe more you tell somebody who's liberal that the caravan coming toward the United states from Honduras was paid for by George Soros and has ISIS members in it the more you try to picture this the more resilient that person who's going to be to receiving the message\nAnd the more somebody on the left start saying the people who are coming up in the caravan are victims of\nOf the violent communities the people in the right or more likely to be resilient to that message and doubled down on the series of an invasion so you heard some words of late like\nRe mob evil media enemies of the state\nAnd I can't but I cannot help but to believe that this sort of rhetoric this tone has gone too far we don't have civil discourse any longer we have\nInsightful discourse we are yelling fire in a crowded movie theater that's what we're doing right now we're saying we have the people's attention only have to do now is make them fearful and they will make donations\nShow up at rallies and vote the way that we tell them to because\nThey're buying into our message of fear not the other side's message of fear\nYou want evidence wait till next commercial break when you hear the politicians coming out to talk about how the other side is to get you\nTurn on TV and wait for the the political ads to pop up that turn it on MSNBC mute the ... the program and the when the commercials come on and you just tell me how much positivity there is\nTell me how much somebody's going to tell you how they can help what their plans are to make incremental positive changes in this country and then tell me how many people have told you that if you don't vote for them we are ...\nTunnel Harris today was coming out talking about this is the most important election of a lifetime President Obama was elected and we were told this country can't survive another four years\nPresident Trump gets elected and we're told this country can't survive for years\nI don't think it's the politicians and their policies\nThat pose the biggest threat\nI think it's our goal ability that poses the greatest threat so my question has the has the tone of our discourse gone too far feel free to disagree sorry because I Believe in civil discourse and I'm willing to hear you\nIf you disagree with you say no the tone is right on it needs to come to our attention this way\nSo be it wouldn't disagree but I'm much happier time but if you do agree with me how do we re set that how do we re set the tone because something\nIs clearly wrong whether it's piped bombing sent to Democrats lunatics taking a pizza parlor hostages not or sending racing packages to President Trump or fire bombings in the north Carolina Jill ... offices something is off track so let's start\nWith the first person that you and I know that can make a difference so personal staring back at us in the mirror how do we make things better\nI've got a suggestion and I'm gonna tell you where I Want to start or do that and love to hear your thoughts to eight hundred six hundred cocoa eight hundred six hundred\nWell that was it that somebody he knew that body slam somebody he was that we don't elect that guy\nHe didn't get elected for yeah he did get elected\nOh did he get elected yeah that was the guy in the public for electing that guy\nRight now is that that was the guy that President Trump got criticized for he was in Montana stumping for that guy here uh last week and uh so thanks for calling me and I appreciate it yeah yeah I appreciate it but I got to get the next one it's a uh looking at a news when he was kind of go up next year\nYou know who's up next re looking to show me\nReal\nYes no radio no you're snoring

Walk\nIn dead or I'm going to tell you some in this country when I came here and go to any other country because this country you know oh for\nLaw and order if the plane a chance to make it okay yeah uh and I believe now that the leadership here the Democrat or is that total embarrass man you know because\nUh this country it's not what I was you know he says I came here or anymore and I believe President Trump\nDespite all the things that people say about him and that he that he does well you know you can find a perfect president I I don't recall it we have had a a perfect but at any of this country if if I agree\nThat Trump any day of the week like a Sunday over any other pet especially\nNow if you don't go out to eat out is under the under ... gives you re when you came here from Nicaraguan and working with a country I'm so glad you ... that you found a place to settle in how did you come here\nWhy I'm so I thought it did it say well if you can mail I\nReally don't know why how what was the message did you did you go to like the American embassy in Nicaragua what was the what was the message you use in order to get here 'cause I Know it's not an easy process\nYeah what
