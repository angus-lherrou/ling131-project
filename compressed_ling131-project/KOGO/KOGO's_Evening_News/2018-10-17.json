keep their quite so it's kind of like winning the lottery but for people who want to move we want to get a job in the city they're going to have more trouble than there because of rent control\nSo I agree with you that the real problem with affordable housing is lack of supply and uh the over regulation of housing rent control actually would make that worse explain why\nWell in order to build a any kind of housing you have to get a lot of permit some ... you know get all kinds of government agencies\nAnd various citizens' groups that have their say if you're not going to be able to make before market rate on that\nUnit that you're going to build you're less likely to build it and so there'll be less construction so that's on the construction side then how about the qualities side one of the most\nClear cut effects of rent control is the way ... caught on the dimensions rates and cut if they're not allowed to charge higher when so much maintenance still closed down the swimming pool they'll charge for ...\nThey'll do all the things that that make the place less desirable\nSo they become slum lord says an incentive become a slum lord\nWell ultimately for a more there's a lot

with the notion of rent control it's very seductive it's such a simple nice warm and fuzzy thing it's like free stops can we educate them that this is actually the worst thing they can back in terms of a policy if they if they want to have more affordable housing\nI think so and by the way one thing to do is go to go on ... or no on channel forgotten effect you find that easily on the Web Web
