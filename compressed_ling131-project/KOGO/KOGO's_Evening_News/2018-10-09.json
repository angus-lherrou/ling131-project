predicted what we've seen\nIn the last few weeks is very much lived up to it hype and more and it had a number of twists and turns there are a number of things about what happened over the last few weeks we're on President and therefore I don't see what happened the last few weeks having any kind of in during presidential value\nFor future confirmation hearing to accept that there was an awful lot of bitterness and going to take some time\nFor the Senate to heal itself I don't see any lasting effect on the way in which the court is held in the public stream\nInteresting point as you said breast more so on the political battles whether they be in the U.S senator somewhere else more so there than on the court itself in these nine members that include judge Kavanaugh now even with a confirmation vote which is only fifty to forty eight one of the closest in the history of this conference\nTo process well that's exactly right I mean I understand that he got fewer just vote in proportional terms in any justice in history but a judge who was confirmed by fifty to forty eight is still called justice justice capital still properly takes his seat is clearly one of the most\nPowerful or more qualified\nJudges ever to sit on the Supreme Court and it'll be interesting to see\nHow he goes about his job his new job and a lot of experience he's just been through over these last few months\nWhat do you think of anything that we know right now I mean it was incredibly bitter process and he himself had to testify to his name into his past well do you think if anything right now for judge Kavanaugh\nWill just with Kevin always going to get over this and the Supreme Court is going to get over this and I'm sure the Supreme Court justices themselves are going to welcome him as a colleague if they did out of swearing in ceremony according to college or body and it's a very small group of individuals they don't get along and justice Calvin all will be welcome to the fold\nActually had a cafeteria so he'll be a having a say in what the justices eat on a\nDaily basis so it's in their interest to be on his good side going forward but that of course if you should come at the bottom line is that a justice Kavanaugh is going to get right to work and we'll start hearing cases tomorrow to have a holiday in some ways that's appropriate\nBecause it allows us to take a break of sorts from all that has gone before he was sworn in on Saturday\nAnd the first case he will here will be on Tuesday after today's Columbus Day break\nNow that the cases are before him and he joined the court what is on the docket in is there anything in particular that we're looking forward to in this session where might the bigger value come down the line when it comes to his seat on the court\nCases that were argued last week the cases for the first week of the court term he will not sit on those cases because he wasn't a member of the court at that time\nYou didn't hear all argument what will happen is if it just is split four to four of those cases in all likelihood advocates will be calendar for re argument in the next term\nOr justice at all I can sit and here those cases of the cases obviously the field started hearing this week or not all that interesting as far as the general population goes what will be interesting will be the case is that the court has not yet accepted for a few cases like\nWeather title of the federal civil rights act applies to claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation and whether that same law applies to transgender individuals\nOther cases could come up involving executive power of the docket the challenge to the deferred action for childhood arrivals program that will just shoot it under President Obama really the first case which justice capital participate that deals with executive power is going to be closely watched\nBecause it's obvious interest to the president who appointed him\nIs there anything else uh when it comes to these future cases or future outlook for the court now that he is indeed confirms movies sitting tomorrow in there what else are we look forward to\nWe're going to
