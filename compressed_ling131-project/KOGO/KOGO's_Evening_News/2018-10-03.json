director of the county office of emergency services\nIt's first of its kind test of a nationwide wireless emergency alert system this is the first one generated nationwide they're calling it a presidential alert it'll happen tomorrow local time it'll be about eleven Eighteen am so at eleven Eighteen\nModern cell phones which is more or less all cell phones anymore we'll get a vibration and a tone and they'll get something that looks a lot like a text message and they'll have a heading that says presidential alert and then their body will say is very simple message this is a test of the wireless alert system no action is needed\nAnd just logistically speaking other folks who when they bought their phone or certain settings may have opted out of these things are is everybody's going to get this\nWhen you buy your phone's there already opted and they have hardware and software built on the phones\nTo receive wireless emergency alerts at the presidential level you cannot even opt out so if you have that on your phone you'll get the alert there are some other levels and they're like a local alert or an Amber Alert that do give you the option to opt out but it's something we hope that people are than Diego will not be doing\nSo it's more obviously is a test is the first as you said of it's kind of this particular be used for in real life in a real rural setting what were some of those things be that would trigger such a thing\nSo the presidential alert is for giant hazards that affect the whole country or we can use them locally and when we use them locally there'll be for severe extreme hazards we don't have a definitive\nList but it needs to have happened or will soon happen and it needs to threaten the life or property when those conditions are met will send out a wireless emergency alert locally and when we sent it out it'll have a protective action along with it that would be evacuate or maybe shelter in place something like that\nNo I'm assuming the county office of emergency services you guys are the coordinating agency in case we have large disasters the number one thing for us as always wildfires so what are we doing in San Diego Kia how we

in my mind though or October is the height of Santa Ana season so even Santa Ana\nCan happen all year round but October seems to be the month where we get\nThe most frequent and the largest Santa Anas\nIs or a message for folks that you guys prepare it only for this test here but for these particular scenarios are the things you tell folks everyday to prepare\nTell people to prepare all the time things like making a plan building a kit registering your phone alert San Diego which is a reverse nine one one system different than wireless emergency alert but if I were to boil it down to one message I Would say having evacuation plan\nSo when you do get a wireless emergency alert or alert San Diego alert or any other type of alert whether that's even loudspeakers or law enforcement officers knocking at your door be ready to evacuate evacuated early get out of the way of those giant wildfires\nThere's really nothing you can do to try to protect your house if there is a win driven Santa Ana driven a wildfire those winds can exceed hurricane force\nYou'll again we'll just speaking with ... and ... like this kind of start to replace you know folks don't have as many landlines

such a thing\nWhile there are some limitations we have with wireless emergency alerts one is we are limited to Ninety characters total for the message that doesn't give us a lot of space to really put a quality message together with a lot of extra information also we can only target these wireless emergency alert\nTo a county wide level so when we send out a wireless emergency alert goes to\nThe entire county we've had for the last ten years another system in place called alert San Diego people may know this has reversed nine one one system and it does have all the landline already but like you said a lion lines are starting to go away but people who would like to receive\nAn alert San Diego email text message or a phone message they need to register their cell phone with over San Diego and what alert San Diego does for us it allows us to target things a lot tighter we can target down to a neighborhood\nAnd messages can be longer and contain more information and if you want to
