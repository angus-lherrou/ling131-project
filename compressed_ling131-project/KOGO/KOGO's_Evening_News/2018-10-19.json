to revise their revenue forecast down from four hundred million to around one hundred fifty million as they struggle to gain support in LA\nBut Steve Hartman with extra Thirteen sixteen Fox Sports San Diego's as we can start thinking about the team returning to San Diego\nIf you are a charger fan you will now be able to see charger games and their new stadium in Englewood\nWhen predicted based on all the other factors appears cells that we've seen around the NFL in a brand new stadium that is pushing four billion dollars to build a stadium that was Seventy thousand seats but that is expandable do a hundred thousand with major events\nWe assume the course of the personal seat licenses were going to be at least on par with everything we've seen in fact\nThe rams head but now says they were selling their tickets that the least expensive P. S. L. would be a thousand dollars a seat in even that sounded low but I'm doing All right a thousand dollars the is there a low bar for the ... cells\nThe charges of announced that twenty six thousand of their season tickets which is about forty percent of their season tickets will have a PS sell a one time payment of\nOne hundred dollars so the rams low bar is it a thousand dollars but chargers are at a hundred dollars and\nAfter you pay that one hundred dollar one time be proceed you could even start buying tickets and just fifty to Ninety dollars per game\nNow trying to put her perspective on how she those tickets are for a brand new stadium I'll put it this way it is unprecedented pretty much\nEverything about the chargers moved to LA has been unprecedented whether it's playing in a soccer stadium or now essentially giving away\nSeats at the new stadium in a desperate effort to get anybody\nTo show up and buy tickets I'm sure that the ticket brokers cow weight to lay down money to buy up all those tickets\nThat's the good news here's the bad news because and I got to believe the rams signed off on this since ... basically owns the building that the chances of the chargers coming back to San Diego now are zero in other words they've created a situation\nBeen allowed to create a situation by their owners so to speak the rams\nTo give away tickets in an effort to keep the team in Los Angeles and I think what we're really gallery right now is that the chargers serve a purpose for the ramps remember the rams been trying to keep the raiders out of town and of course now the raiders are going to be in Vegas but they're going to be marketing\nTo LA to get a chance to go to Vegas but by allowing the chargers to gobble up some of\nThe tickets that are being sold the LA area it's another way for the rams to hold off the radar fan so\nIt's actually the rams are decided the chargers have value to us even if they're not generating a for action of the revenue that they were originally going to generate now still up to the NFL to decide whether or not the chargers can get away with what they're getting away with\nIf the ruling to actually write off the chargers when obviously a new ownership may be moving the team back to San Diego would be a better long term plan for the league\nAnd that's what they are discussing this week at the league meetings is the business sense that the chargers in Los Angeles me and the possible future of the business of the Los Angeles chargers does was being discussed you this week by the national football league\nWell and and this is what we talked about one the charters openly admit that their sights set on a four hundred million dollar revenues been suddenly downgrade or a hundred and fifty million the NFL's down into downgrading anything but not into discounts they're not into anything other than teams that are generating max money\nSo part of the UN thing on the surface All right well maybe the least got to step in and say no not acceptable\nBut there is the cranky factor\n... with the passing of Paul Allen is now the richest owner and the national football league with that he carries an amazing amount of clout\nAnd staying groggy walks into the NFL Owners meetings and say look the other way when it comes to the charter situation LA the owners will look the other way\nSo we haven't heard the last of it is it's going to be an interesting subject matter for months to come certainly through the twenty ninth team season next year but\nEventually if stand ... says I Want the chargers here don't worry about the money I Will I'm sure that the NFL Owners will play along\nStill are present in the drug\nTed Garcia cocoa news\nComing up sheriff deputies are trying to find a man and sexually assaulted a
