chargers is now dead at the age of Ninety five he bought the team for forty eight million dollars in Nineteen eighty four it's now worth two points three billion he had been battling dementia for more than two decades and turned over control of the team did was sending in Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd because of the family had issues with the state taxes in the past\nWith most of their net worth tied to the team\nMany had speculated they would have to sell the chargers but Steve Hartman from extra Thirteen sixty thought sports San Diego says new rules in the NFL will allow the span of family to keep control of the team\nProblem with the span of family from the get go as they were out of town or is that from Stockton, California span hosted build his empire and then he had his children and it was a family operation it's interesting about dean span those because\nDean I remember so well the super bowl in Miami when the chargers went to their one and only Super Bowl when Alex was still very much the man I Am not kidding you I Am watching as dean span hosts is literally carrying his father's suitcases into the hotel\nThat was the significance of dean span is at the time but his father said I got to find something for this guy to do\nAnd he gave him the opportunity to run the organization and of course the rest is history it\nWas always frustrating for charger fans because they never got a true sense of the Spanish family was a a hundred percent committed to building a championship team and be really committed to the city of San Diego and now of course the team is no longer hear Alex bad in those hasn't had really any saying the chargers for many many many years\nBut one quick update for a lot of people that don't know this and we're always hearing about inheritance tax and everything else will the NFL ...\nIs this rule back in twenty Fifteen that trust\nCould basically keep the franchise after the ... family was forced to sell the dolphins the Wilson family was forced to sell the Buffalo Bills so this was able to keep the teams in a trust and what\nAlex than hosted years ago was he gave up sixty percent of his share of the team divided equally among has four children including dean\nSo the charters are not going to be sold they're not going to be forced to be sold\nThe span of his family still controls Ninety six percent of the franchise\nPlus remember they had the ... tax when they moved to LA which would be like twenty percent to the league if they try to do a quick sale of the team so if anyone is thinking today hey\nAlex battles has gone maybe a little sell the team that's not happening\nSo much bad blood both the spouses and the city of San Diego obviously what happened in January of last year but as you said I mean Alex spin offs and been around for two plus decades belly dementia now passing away so when you think about the future of the Los Angeles chargers now\nAnd the possibilities of selling the team now even with\nThe new rules that are in place the fact that they moved to Los Angeles one of the thoughts was it would set you up for sale eventually five ten years whatever it is how does the deaths of Alex battles play into that\nWell now what's happened is there were four span of children being being the oldest now they will equally share the Ninety six percent so you do the math the each on twenty four percent of the team\nThere's always the possibility of course there's infighting amongst the family we talk about the bus family equally dividing the shares of the Lakers and the father making it clear they're no individual could sell out their share it would have to be done as a group I don't know what the span of family\nHas agreed on I think that again they're not going to sell the team unless it makes sense for that and I said this before through twenty twenty\nThere is a twenty percent flipped tax on the gross sale of the team they're not going to give up that kind of money now I Do know that the span of his family had look for other investors but let's say I give you half a billion dollars and I'm going to put the money and deans hands\nNo takers so they solicited many times to try to get other investors to put their money in\nAnd they haven't been able to find any buyers and now that Forbes has established the fact that moving the team to LA did not really increased the by the franchise that that has not changed no one is willing to have their money to dean span owes feeling like he really understands what he's doing\nAlex battles was a shrewd businessman you know he was one of those guys would tell sales\nTales that you know when he would get home was a kid they have to take off their shoes to save the soul on their ... you know one of those type of stories the fact is is that he had a falling out with his own father borrowed money from somebody else and basically the heck with you I'm going to build my own empire which he did\nDean is never shown any aptitude to do anything but be a trust baby and be handed job so the future business of the chargers\nIs very interesting dynamic I Know the league would love to get that charger team wrestled out of the span of his family hands but the reality is is that alec span those had the foresight to do the things necessary to keep the chargers in possession of those battles family for as long as\nThey choose to have it Steve Bartman\nFrom extra Thirteen sixty Fox Sports San Diego so new rules in the NFL will allow the spouse family keep control the chargers even after the death\nToday of Alex span of ... which I
