{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "We are raised the money\nAs you know we worked very closely together gathered the signatures to get the constitutional amendment on the ballot and we were successful and I'm very proud of our efforts\nOr you know what's frustrating is your opponent Katie Porter she is now changing your position now says that she's four yes on prop six the gas tax repeal\nBut that's kind of funny because when I contracted hurt not once not twice but four times she refused to take a call refused to respond to the email and you know what we tracked every signature on the gas tax repeal initiative she didn't even sign the initiative to put it on the ballot talk about not not really wanting it\nAnd then finally we got her on tape\nShe actually says this used for the gas tax increase and she made fun of your efforts to get voters' voice [noise]\nWhat do you deal with that when your opponent basically lives\nWhen my my liberal opponent is a flip flopper she's never run for office before to my knowledge she's never held elected office to my knowledge\nSo she doesn't have a record and she's pandering to special interests she knew in the primary that she had to go as far less as she could in order to get out of the primary and so she of course supported the gasoline tax and then once she saw with the polling was and she saw how popular it was to repeal the gasoline cat\nThat was going to be again the guard tax increase and the gasoline tax increase the he's a total flip flopper and you can't believe that he thinks he says\nNow your race is one of the closest watched races in California in across the country or races are considered lean Republican lean Democrat toss up depending upon the various ratings up\nAnd do you think Republicans will hold a majority [noise]\nI think my race it very close um I ... a polling has\nMe up for points just in my own personal polling momentum is on our side the absentee ballots are coming in very strong and that's an early indicator in my opinion because sixty five percent of my district votes absentee so we have a very big spread between Republicans and Democrats right now and the absentee [noise] um\nI Do believe we will keep the majority and the reason I Believe we will keep the majority in the house is because of the policies that this administration has\nSigned into law that Congress has but on the president's desk I'm rolling back the Obama era regulations tax reform has played such a crucial role in our economy being unleashed and growing as well as it is and people have more money in their paychecks\nA People's for one case are more valuable today a people um are able to get a job because at appointments at its lowest in forty nine years these are all because of the policy Congress as policies that Congress has passed and the president signed into law and that's why I Believe we will keep the majority\nNow you you do have a very close race and uh you know obviously people have an opportunity to support various candidates across the state um if you don't get involved in local race you can always come up to Orange County and get involved in a race up here\nAre now on November third we're going to be at your campaign office that big forty forty eight foot bus\nIs going to make its way up to Orange County Irvine where you have a pretty big campaign office with a lot of phones a lot of opportunities for people to call and walk um tell me a give us your pitch as to why volunteers should select your race to invest their precious time in volunteering on\nIf we lose my race then we lose the majority in the U.S house of representatives and we can't afford to do that because what will happen is we will go backward there will be chaos in Washington DC we won't be able to move our agenda forward I'm One of those bellwether races\nThat as being looked at nationally to see how we do and it's imperative people get out and vote for the Republicans to make sure that we keep the house\nRight you're hurting your congresswoman Mimi Walters\nOr she is one of the hottest uh uh races in the country right now it's very tight and as I agree with her if she loses her race it likely is that we lose the control the Congress for Republicans\nIf you want to join that volunteer deployment on November third go to a gas tax repeal dot org sign
