Donald Trump is going to heat for calling what happened to Brett Kavanaugh evil I think that's actually\nA quite an accurate description but of course millennia Trump She is also um than just completely mistreated by the media can you imagine someone was such poised indignity an immigrant being able to come to this country and become the first lady\nThat is like it's like the American

about the uh me too movement Jews asked about the accusations of sexual harassment\nThat's what she had to say\nDo you believe in them do you support the me too movement\nI supported the men and they need to be we need to support them and you know also men not to the men\nDo you think men in the news that I've been accused of of sexual assault sexual harassment had been treated unfairly\nYou need to have a really hard evidence that you know you see all kinds of something so that evidence\nSomeone in my view of that and say how could you say that this is troubling you have to stand with women going\nOn with them but we moved to ... to sell and all of them not to say to somebody I was you know sex and his all that um [noise] or you need that to me or because sometimes the need to go too far\nAnd um [noise] they way they would ... some ... not the correct thoughts right\nI Can't believe that the reporters says how can you said that his oh what did she say you need to show the evidence and he like looked at her like she had\nFifteen heads how can you say that oh my God you are [noise] what is this evidence\nUm isn't that kind of the\nFundamental fairness notion in our country that

mouth I can destroy you who needs a gun who needs a knife just simply say\nHe touched me you touched me she or he did it a lot\nAnd you're like okay this is serious allegation is pretty damn serious so how did it happen where were you what were the specifics you have anything to corroborate did tell anyone you have any evidence\nOh you need to believe me look I I I Want to believe you I don't think that you have the capability of doing this to someone else and lying about them I I Hope you don't you telling us the truth\nIs okay let's presume that you're telling us the truth oh do you have any evidence because we can't just simply do something to someone else without some sort of cooperation and evidence that would not be fair\nYou see if you allow even one false accusation to move forward without evidence you are encouraging evildoers to take and weaponize the me too movement\nThat's what you're doing okay so to my little swarming liberal media reporter who asked millennia how can you say that\nIf you want to go to North Korea if you want to go to Stalin's Russia if you want to go to Nazi Germany where those regimes get rid of their opponents by just making crap up and making an accusation and then they're sent off to the gulag or a concentration camp\nOr the Siberia or wherever and you know North Korea you go probably basically down the streets and everyone starving anyway um [noise]\nIs that where you want to go and by all means go there and have a wonderful time as a journalist oh yeah they don't allow freedom of press so sorry about that you want it to basically be living in a country where an accusation alone can take someone down\nMeans you must also live with all the other lack of freedom and intolerance\nAnd problems do already Mr usher it's

friday but it's a chance also some rain again Saturday and Sunday that beach has her statement remains in effect through friday afternoon for waves to ten feet\nAnd strong rip currents downtown sixty eight to go this time is six eleven\nThe stock market took a big hit today with the Dow off eight hundred thirty two points but double business editor George Chamberlain says there is no cause for panic\nFrom one of those things that happens periodically we had a big sell off as far as points are concerned anytime the Dow\nGoes down eight hundred and thirty points that's a big decline it's it's it's a three percent decline we've had many many days much worse than this but it comes with the tail end of the past five trading sessions have been all to the downside we haven't done that since two thousand eleven\nAnd it's just a little bit of venting going on I think right now for the overall market\nAs you said there is some perspective here you you share of the reports okay it's the third worst trading day ever just in terms of number of points for the Dow but you said they're all ... percent just consider as well\nSo I Will never forget the date in Nineteen eighty seven when the Dow Jones industrial average in one day was down twenty three percent\nThat's what you call a crash okay this is a this is a a ripple\nIn the market we've gotten way ahead remember nine years ago the Dow was at six thousand six thousand five hundred and something\nNow we're at twenty six thousand so we've come a long way and you know along the way you have to vent this thing every once in a while and that's where it seems we've been doing big concerns about higher interest rates big concerns about the economy may be growing too fast and and higher higher interest rates being necessary to slow down\nYou can come up with a million excuses basically what today was there were more sellers than buyers\nHundred and thirty two points on the Dell let's take a couple of those examples you brought up there are some of the possible reasons and again this is what it is when it comes to the market there were more ebbs and flows but for today or secular emission interest rates so that was a big part of it\nYeah and it has been for the last week by by the way a week ago today jak\nThe Dow Jones industrial average hit an all time high and so here we are a week later we're going through a little bit of a people taking their profits in here but at the interest rate thing is is legitimate and even though we are still at a\nArranged for interest rates that has historically very very low\nOr the prospect the prospect of interest rates going up is is is what is driving the markets and by the way we got a report today that showed the producer price index was actually down a little bit compared to a year ago which means that there is no real inflation out there tomorrow we'll get a report on the consumer price index I think it'll show the same thing\nThat you mentioned is the fact that we have it on such an enormous upswing the last year plus really it's been the last two years as a norm of swing upwards for the markets the inevitably as you continue on that staircase model there are some steps as you go up\nYeah trees don't grow to the sky is one of the great lines I've I've heard said over and over again and stocks don't go up forever so there's going to be these times when you have to see a correction in here and you know what we're we're down\nRight now if you take a look at the past week when ... remember we hit an all time high on the Dow last Wednesday so if we hit you know and we've come down five six percent\nUh we're still not in what is called the correction territory that would be a ten percent decline and so it ... maybe another eight hundred point last tomorrow that might get us to a a correction which usually happens two or three times and every year\nSo we're just going through a very normal sequence here but boy I tell you what I was watching\nFox Business in CNBC today and you would have thought that it was the end of the world I mean they were just going crazy over this thing and that's a that's too bad you don't want to ... you don't want to make any mistakes as an investor right now and overreact to a day like today\nIt was things about the market right now is that and maybe this has always been the case in some ways but\nThere is very very top heavy stocks a particular things like Amazon and apple right and they took big hits today and therefore a lot of that is Amazon and apple of some of these huge stocks Netflix Facebook you know some of those ones if they take big hit what do you think is the short term outlook for those stocks\nWell Amazon is one that you got to pay attention to it's not a doubt stock but it's a it's a big one and the NASDAQ\nAnd it was down a hundred and forty seven dollars a share today one thousand eight hundred and one\nAnd that's a nasty decline and obviously it you you should know if you're going to invest in Amazon that it's gonna be a wild ride that you're going to be bouncing all over the place you're going to have days when it's up a hundred and forty seven days when it's down a hundred and forty seven\nImagine if you're a guy like Warren Buffet today his stock today was down sixteen thousand five hundred dollars\nTo three hundred Nineteen thousand dollars but do you think Warren Buffett's upset about that probably not don't overreact to this kind of a thing if you're in the market for the long run and you and you don't need the money you know in the next three five years\nJust sit back and and and write this thing out and try not to let your emotions get involved when investors make their biggest mistakes when they let their emotions get involved
