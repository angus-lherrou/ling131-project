New York I've warrant you over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare short of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got started so important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation is kept his promise on building the wall isn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduce the bolt built today to fully fund the wall but he has spent\nThree point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit\nRemember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history we know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with the cameras were had arranged to it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration a Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing and then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nRemember the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil will they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that they went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dusty a when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or or stepped aside\nAnyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what it reveals since that directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI official sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath and Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the Pfizer warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe ... the application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponents Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials that the D. OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes as she was on with Maria berets aroma I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the size of warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without a Hillary's involvement here\nThey wouldn't have been a ... an application to spy on the Trump campaign\nPanoramic why from Cox [noise]\nThough the bigger bombshell to come out of again we were busy last week with the capital issue but the bigger bomb that come out of the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment anyway it turns out that\nNot long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire\nTo record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicle by both the deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boy friend\nThey went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was\nIt was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was couldn't say in that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nNo Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving those things [noise]\nNews radio six hundred co go live local breaking\nThe

hardly the\nSwap politician at a time this is Sean Hannity show\nTwenty five 'til the top of the hour a scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit landed a category three a and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort\nWalton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh it's hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast as I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place\nAnd it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and it's being I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is it\nSo I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we uh\nCovered the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins and mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three or four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast in especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area the weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a police that strong category perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember showing last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look the average person including\nMe has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern when Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency ... came out and said look out October fifth\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and say well what does that have to do with that as well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to a Catholic or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw it once we got so last Thursday and friday you know I'd been shown knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with court and Alberto\nHit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's hitting it's heading into classical bashing from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the northeast from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle\nGoing to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea yeah\nWon't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe ... hurricane force along the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nBecause the people in California are fundamentally understanding what Gavin Newsom is proposing is that an economic disaster for that state went oh free health care for everybody it doesn't matter if you're in California legally or not\nAnd also the cost of it being not only a sanctuary city like San Francisco but a sanctuary state\nWell that means that that includes health care that's the criminal justice system that the educational system\nAnd if people not paying taxes are in the state illegally and maybe some illegal immigrants do but they're certainly\nAvailable to use services under what Gavin Newsom is proposing for everybody it's basically putting a sign out that would say hey free health care in California just make it here and we'll take care of you\nAnd you know people are going to do they're going to make it there and use the California health system and remember California already has a state income tax of Thirteen and a half percent\nYou know add that to a federal income tax and the fact that you can no longer the duck after the tax cut plan passed you can no longer\nCaught or deduct rather your state income taxes on your tax return I mean is that if you do make money in California you're paying that much more in taxes\nSo the people of California are hit harder than any other state in the United states and New York is where I Am is right behind them just ridiculous\nThe amount of the burdens that they're putting on the people of California and Dianne Feinstein is up for reelection it's going to be interesting to see if ah Gavin Newsom will pull her down in terms of the polls but anyway we'll we'll have to watch that race a little more closely and see what happens all the way we do have\nAn attempt by the ...

norms but he is the feeding for all of us and I and I just read a little bit of the article I didn't finish it yet\nBut I think what he's saying there's a point that I've been making as well except in a different way and that is that if you look at any criticism of Donald Trump it's all stylistic stuff\nOut of style they don't like that is combative they don't like that he breaks dishes they don't like that he fights they don't like that he is at times not polite\nUm they don't like that he's a disruptor an iconoclastic they've got their image of how a president needs to behave in an act in what they should say and that they shouldn't be tweeting and this and that the problem with that has to be get rid of that side of Donald Trump you get rid of what we elected\nThe disruption is good

Congress ... personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them either in southwest Florida ... ... when you are listening you\nKnow why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create obstacles blocks us on tour\nAnd we're ... ... ... ... points with Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country was eating some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're using it for all and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWondering insuring it using insurance drives up the cost of the product\nSo an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical I'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee yeah on the ...\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free healthcare but everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much does the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack a accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nIf the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send him an originality\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a ... plus the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal\nOr so from that ... just brought by ... with access these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month a\nLot about it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\n... everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but well so now we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWhat they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know
