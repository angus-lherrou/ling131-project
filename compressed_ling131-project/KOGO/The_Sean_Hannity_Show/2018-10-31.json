Republicans raise the sexes decided as ... dirty air water kill children throat granny over the cliff but its way over that now\nAnd we've seen it let's let's look at this horrific anti Semitic you know bigoted racist attack on innocent people in the synagogue in in Pittsburgh let me play just immediate blaming Trump now understand that the shooter hate Trump\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel and yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTerror threats in this country is white man most have been radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you stop say mean things about me I'll stop and citing angry lunatic to kill you whether the\nPresident knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated what\nTrump is doing is stoking inciting for the purposes of political power the worst amongst us to take action in his name anybody who's ... says that there is not causality between these events\nAny instruments dishonest as they are blind\nI don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that as being ... by the president of the United states or\nRacism anti Semite thinks that he's four dollar an original violent than any medical as\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel thinking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot the skull east on the ball field in and shut up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it ...\nIt would have been wrong to blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rationale they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is it is what it is\nThe biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs you know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying\nThey don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... full of Russian lies used to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty six me it was it was used to get ... warrants unverified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the dusty doesn't even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them for moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be\nMaybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east one super all because of the threat of Iranian had Gemini in the region now caused an alliance that was on ... maybe just the number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think he's just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media they don't even see what blowing hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up\nTheir rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but they are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card he said I'm a nationalist saving do comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for\nFinally admitting that you're a white fashion list and\nThen you have a we even some Republican back ventures are that are are linking George Soros in these anti Semitic threats to the caravan Fox News talking about\nSmall pox and leprosy coming up it is I I'm Sorry I won't say specifically white regime this is out of but go back and read your history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twentieth century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy which is in lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they were talking about gypsies and Jews [noise]\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nWe have to stop demonizing people and not leaving ...\nBiggest terrorist threats in the\nWhite men most of it I'm radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy bands [noise] so what do we do about that\nI I just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host suggesting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be hearing in on the two pillars of the media continuing his trail and attack against\nAnd migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to pay and using some of the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms of the invaders and\nInvasion for these tragedies working at cross purposes narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of ... migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joined list pay hard not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also a time has gone along with them as as cars out there who not only\nThat that just like oh I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh here in New York character he's not a Republican or Democrat he's just an advocate [laughter] [laughter] [noise] and I don't mean that an ad hominem [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they eat a ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night\nWill be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't there is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me\nOne week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this\nI Do see fear at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that\nThe election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN white lashed out against the country et cetera\nYeah that that's not ... it is they end up back in their head really fear you know\nThe American people and what you're going to decide\nEvery race matters is

I don't know why he's a great guy smart poster but you know they say oh these are right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that rats mused on was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact\nOn the midterm elections but again it's all up to now interesting developments as a relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico and uh\nNow you have and I look there was only see most people that come into this country illegally\nI think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey hoping opportunity and the American dream\nAnd when you live in poverty and countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom is very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that care of and want a better life\nAnd that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen\nThe president's been very clear\nUm the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants\nFrom Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage maybe clip point two percent\nOr you know less or summer quarter reporting that she identified him as Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away\nUm but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking the people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let the men nor can he because there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty ordination built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border official telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan\nA that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer told the examiner\nFamilies and unaccompanied children make up about twenty percent twenty to thirty percent of the caravan Roy of ... is the deputy chief patrol agent for the border patrol San Diego sector arrested that a single adult males he goes on to say\nUh Mexico now is shut down a lot of their public transportation so the people in the caravan went up to walk which you know literally weeks away and they've also offered temporary work permits to the migrants to register for asylum\nWhich I think it was a very you know Mexico's been far tougher on the illegal immigrants that we ever dream to be\nUm it's just sad that so many you know one of the things that America when the president talks about America First we've got to get every American out of poverty first reality ... every American their own opportunity by the way all this at stake six days from now\nWe've got to take care of our American family first and that only enriches us to help others as well and we're the most generous country on earth as I've said so many times has been no

Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban were Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nUm so I I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble of West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and it's interesting I was looking at the different levels yeah Menendez on a carry on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nSkills uh when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things and some very very unsavory\nRumors and it will build around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll cabin to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to put somewhere else then are prone to get back in the New Jersey because we barbecue can I'm really really good candidates\nWho is a great to see you know very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare can help develop and sound practical working alternative to government run health care\nAnd um she didn't even have may well between his own screening people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez so they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure it out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... much like on the air and they're I think people know nobody listening should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and they they feel about run out one voted for him if he ended up not having to buy election they do not do anything else go day to vote who should that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats and\nAbout one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans having the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense they needed a forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nThe house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\n[noise] why not functionally ah I I my personal range is returning to the bottom of about ... form which would mean Pelosi ... Anaheim around two twenty thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy including bookish speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't I've been in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say do you\nSee I didn't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that they can see below sea what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is you know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but\nIt's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment and lives investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back a sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nKenny one who does not bode\nHas effectively voted for him and she should

cutting jobs can mistreated get them medical help but I mean ... what's your money where their mouth is and let them adopt these ... these families so that they can earn their pathway to citizenship instead of just walking across the border it misses maker\nI'm not I think that's that's that's a pretty frankly it's a very reasonable statement where we are and how we could approach it uh in terms of birth trying to show a there is no provision fourteenth amendment\nWon't you anyway requiring people who were born outside of the jurisdiction of the law to be considered as citizens and she's very clear or debates on it in the Congress took their time Clinton's you rebuild the country with no it's very clear on what it means I\nPersonally think the question is far better off to him since ... challenge and Congress to repeal it\nRather than doing just as the presidential jak if you order because there's going to be more the next president ... could reverse it but if you turned it into a law there'll be a pretty hard to change and wants to not adopted and it's a healthy debate for us to have the country because it comes back to exactly the same challenges to care of them are we as a nation\nAre we allowed to define who is an American are we in a position where we can say to people who are not American you'd have to meet some test or to be considered to be eligible to serve\nSo it's just in my eyes are so important to get that younger voter out to vote and vote for their future\nWell I it's hard to get that through the young people to be very blunt about it in young people

wrong [noise]\nYou know when\nAnd the only way that she's going to get that capital back is through California in orange county and in my district it was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when\nOrange County and found the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting 'cause most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think\nA real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups are are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm can money at\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living a America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life\nAnd I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district\nWe had over ... fourteen point advantage on the after the the return over the Democrats so we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters they're just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins but\nThe house it's just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people ... and you're\nA state and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free healthcare for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California's ... reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now are on the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd found it is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that uh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where that pendulum swings back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for California and the tail we\nOne of the problems is that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York\nIllinois New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when I go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it I mean it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if your\nA number of the union you no longer have to pay your is that unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nI got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is was Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nOr and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nI ... like twenty thirty thousand\nThat's also internationally wow that's good for you well let me ask you this\nAnd that you're in Minneapolis and my actually go ahead and do the job that we need to do and prove to try that we are hundred percent hundred and fifty percent support him because\nIt's not the Trump train and ... and the fat in Newburg has closed the gap for Clovis shower ward low it's Thirteen percent higher than Alex and there's some really good signs here for going red in Minneapolis\nWell the last thing is I Want to remind people there are very important house races in uh Minneapolis or in well in Minnesota for this race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look but let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're and you did this radio show and you started your own business\nDid you make a lot more money\nHere I mean we weren't that that bad recession in Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean that excitement and
