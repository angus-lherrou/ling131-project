thereafter or because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very or\nA but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government\nAre and what is best for the American working family so ah and that's why he's doing so well ... and by the way you know I was ... doing a lot of traveling around the country I was in Detroit last night I spoke to three or four hundred people\nBut they still come out and be able to get a different place as\nNick's roast explains help Planned Parenthood hide their financial support for McCaskill so the senator can try to maintain a moderate image to moderate voters\nTreasury like don't you looked at me like whatever like do the other one of those ... ... house\nAnd that's to mix because their their name is so polarizing says he's pro life people from knowing the pro life dams from Mike\nI mostly do you go deep deep deep down and just have to finance which most people will just keep right and like the people that do that are going to be for the U.S\nRight now so yeah so you are and so that keeps them keep the Planned Parenthood name off of this thing but we still get to know that\nI Love that\nI live on what works for us [laughter]\n[laughter] so I'm Still trying to wrap my head around that that uh make was talking about them and then and Planned Parenthood won't donate to us oh now I understand why I don't get\nI think the thing with like a while and not Dorothy any red state Democrats feel like\nIt's not Democrat is it coming on to like the south's man yeah I think it's a topic that's not too far left as high as ... we're still going to support and more than ... yeah yeah well like not not like\nOther means of support and get the money they just don't get the money from there like\nA basically we're still going to protect a woman's right to choose\nOne hundred percent and we kinda do that I don't think I could work for a class she doesn't mind for me to\nRichardson tells our journalists to Planned Parenthood goes through quote other means to support and give the money unquote\nIll I was just so\nYeah so I Know the name as hot as hell to some\nOf them but we want to somewhere like they are abortion I mean yeah so and like I Know she gets a lot of money from emily's list I'm just like us that guns are my two biggest issues yeah\nNo I think they're pretty strong

James O'Keefe\nYou know you are hated by people because of what you're doing it there I'm ... I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discuss and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen either Senate candidates one of them as a United States senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got a bike all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about somebody's position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much have shown for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now it's supposed to something that I'd been pointing out for a while we Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda like campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite to hide who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now\nUh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees that McCaskill quote essentially\nHas to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding hiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money to ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking constituency in Missouri\nDemocratic Party have voted these people out the McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in any sense of due\nProcess under the law equal application under our law is you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute capital was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these anarchist middle class of dangers attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from taking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was this stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she had been quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of ... betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV on Claire McCaskill just\nFalsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud will will will buy what were courting the people being honest that's far\nIn their own their own their own or it's\nNot my words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers nixed a roast about how she's going to impeach Trump but you can tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nI'm just glad that you will\nA new complaint filed in federal court here in California you accuses the

down on the fly is the most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty anti it backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because what she needs to come out and apologize all of it\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president at the United states are you going to find that as well I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part-time author part-time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic

heroes\nMy campaign about forty pounds about getting the job done Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this message\nThat is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now told the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\nThose ads by Jeff deal was born well she does have to get re elected a senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed forever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania I'll teach you got to Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it in another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American in a professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against\nAs a result of all this then tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up
