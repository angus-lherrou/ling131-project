[laughter] he's ... am why I live\nHis twelve o'clock is it's just that again it goes first news of doing I'm clip Albert alone with the ... team coming up the very latest on the caravan of Central American immigrants uh going through Mexico right now but our top story at this hour putting the brakes on the scooters instead of going to go\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of meat to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with Ben Nelson you\nKnow but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida you'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got infinite whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd in Iran to set this up out of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nElements use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBeing honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett is said and the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason Brennan said is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that is something that he is not that he's a moderate to liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and\nSaying that his public position I'm Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice costs\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process that way\nSovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant now it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you\nBut I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for inferior coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one of the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack but\nThe anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema I mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support\nIt skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox a poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave and\nSweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill\nUrging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom ... has still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison said today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi\nWhereas her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall ... Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly a problem for the Republican Braun in\nThe state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race and that means that the libertarian is siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong well Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nI mean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we had four thousand people around there a moment\nAt a huge crowd in Houston as well we're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got of course the hypocrisy so we've got\nThe cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country you've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans\nPanoramic why five from ...\n\n\nWe have a report out that the caravan is now grown according to the Washington Times fourteen thousand illegal immigrants marching towards our southern border the\nPresident just spoke out about it with a play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour out if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting gas we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now surveys escorts that appears for the care of on as they know battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah buys for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspapers say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance they appear confident that this confrontation is gonna come\nDown to this is there's this extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh mattered they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans didn't think it really don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the boats\nTo change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nOr the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back we have a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead\n[noise]\nThing you have to drive three over mano credible will\nYou'll dine on oh you can eat Maine lobster traps [laughter] crime real one hundred feet of homemade

says the caravan has now grown to fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others wage\nThat's part of the story the president now has alerted the military to be on standby for possible deployment orders to the U.S southern border I mean this is in every word you know I remember I think Michelle Malcolm wrote a book years ago called invasion\nThe American people I Know the Democrats they're thinking this is their moment this is good for them I don't I don't see how any of this is good for the\nDaily Caller has a piece out saying that the majority of people in the care of on not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports said the new way above a caravan hers is comprised quote a mostly young men who will ...\nThey're able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know behind a chain link fence at the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nNow this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times\nI have seen it it's wide open what are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports as even helping the caravan or make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally that is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give it to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty they're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies\nThat allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there around you know it just I mean it's basically a national emergency if you look at it\nYou have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan and a report friday said that they have met people from ... dash\nJoining the people from Guatemala into Mexico Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana reported that the bridge separating ... while the mullah and Mexico the bridge has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico this was going back to friday the ultimate goal crossing into the U.S illegally\nShe writes the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it impossible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly um so you've got the care of and continuing their march\nNow a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from\nThe Rio Grande the San Diego helicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles\nYou foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there so an entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me a bit of the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that have that have been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is going to win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom is promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\nI think that's a long time\nFor a long time there's no reason for that by\nLooking at it we have a lot of different\nConcepts right now they have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right

going to be I think they really wanted to see that I'm On his side and I am a hundred percent\nUh we have I mean you've been reporting over a hundred thousand people may lined up two days ago and it's very exciting why do I think that will be a big factor that I got to get up really going to make a great speech\nI'm going to get up I'm going to make a great speech I oh are you folks do you go and

open borders now we know what they're real position is but what are they going to advise the president to do is fourteen thousand people now are heading towards that border\nNot a good position for anybody to be in the president is committed not only to cutting off aid to the countries that are allowing this to happen which you should do\nBut also he's put our military I noticed that he may have to send them down and that people are not going to be walking across our border elite illegally this is what's happening every day you just seeing it in one larger number one see her\nOther anecdotal

I think we're going to be fine ah but yeah we're at ... at a couple of days we've been here in South Carolina last friday there were all over the place\nYou only get interesting to watch the states like California Southern California six important house seats that could yeah the the ... the balance of power in the house Minnesota has important races Ohio does Michigan does Pennsylvania and New York and New Jersey do\nYeah no I think in the end Sean\nWhen you look at the radical positions the leftist take I Would argue the most extreme positions in American history where they you know they applied ... just respect the flag they Iran don't recall when he said America was never that great and they they embrace Maxine Waters when she got harassed anybody support our president\nContracts that vision for where they want to take the country\nAs we've talked about before with what the president has accomplished at Twenty one month with his leadership in this country taxes regulations down economy growing it for ... percent loan with not employment forty years course each and cabin on the court out of the Iran deal embassy in Jerusalem it on and on we could go\nSo those are the competing visions those are the kind that's the contrast\nI think when American step back and look they're going to pick Republicans or we're going to keep the majority in the house\nBetween no due process for Kavanaugh no presumption of innocence for Kavanaugh these are core values that have served as well as a country and then you've got this lawless caravan and I I don't hear a single Democrat saying we've got to stop\nWhat is it looks like an invasion fourteen thousand people just want to run across the border maybe more and if that happens what's going to happen after that\nIt's like a party that is basically given up on the rule of law unconstitutional and the values that have served a so well over these many years\nExactly right or the most extreme positions ... got closer with is that you got\nFormer Secretary Clinton said oh yeah well get civil in once we have our that's not really supposed to be this great nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you've got this caravan marching north thousands and thousands of people um I think the president's right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid if this if this is going to continue\nAnd talking about putting hooks on the border putting troops on the border ... National Guard in order to make sure this\nIs what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and a president that are saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty um no I I think Democrats ally go in the back of their heads hoping this happens so oh maybe something bad will happen in Trumbull look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I'm not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady couldn't is that the Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said\nI'm In I'm sick of this kind of stop she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted a choice for her goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications and and motivations behind these think\nThat's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this

about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's

you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here
