Jim\n[noise] great Russia are you doing fine thank you\nGod Bless you what you do I've been listening to you for twenty five plus years this I just wanted to make a quick point about that whole caravan um I think it's a godsend for Trump\nBecause I Believe that Americans like the ones that elected him you know we respect to sing about this country fairness and strength and um you know the Kavanaugh hearing was going down before Kevin our show strength and every time Trump shows during the\nGames against momentum and we found the military down there as a message and if the military treats everyone with respect a sort of almost like a enhanced FEMA then I think this is going to be a net positive for him and if the Democrats trying to you know\nWhat do you think the Democrats objective with this is what the Caribbean\nYeah what do you think they're trying to accomplish with us 'cause somebody's behind it somebody's paying for it you know it's a liberal Democrat donors somewhere or a series up my ... on\nThe truth I think honestly rush that the Democrats plan is anarchy because they don't have a plan I think they they are just\nThe proverbial party that throws everything against the wall to see what will stick because do you remember the or\nScience fiction film Forbidden Planet\n... years I rent me where I\nWas like a a ... a monster that was made of energy that that was conjured up by this man I did was Walter pigeons brain and every time they attack it grew in strength it absorbed all that energy\nAnd that's basically what Trump is he absorbs all the energy just makes me stronger\nIt makes the people that support him a digging their heels even even further down and it makes president war how comfortable and confident because he's\nUsed to being attacked and it doesn't faze him you know and um I just think that the Democrats right now or in a point where they just are in a in a like a a fever and they can't figure out how to get this guy and they're going to throw anything and everything\nI Do I I I I Do think that they are seriously Fox I don't I'm not saying this to be funny or outrageous to call attention to myself I\nI really think that in a large swath of callers that Democrats are but the American left I think there is a creeping insanity\nThat has been building it existed it's been building since Trump won the election it has been building with every failure but they thought was a lock to get rid of him\nThe futility the fact that they're not even slowing him down or harming is driving them crazy because their experiences if they target somebody for destruction that person generally is destroyed\nAnd they can't even dent Trump they were not stable to begin with and I think there's psychological disorders and I've been amplified into so called legitimate political issues and I think we're all in danger of these\nPeople feel his own ... rush home again I miss more\nJust ahead on news radio\nHorror forty one hard radio is easy to use them more music\nDownloads a free I hard with us today [noise]\nOkay my idol reminder my interview with Sean Hannity denied nine o'clock in the Fox news channel still know feedback here folks from the staff [noise] I Know what are you seeing that there are a lot of quotes from the intervening weeded out there\nBy Fox and the and others but\nAnyway that's that we will be back\nTomorrow open mind fried I see them holding his tail geo ham why go live\nTwelve o'clock is is setting it goes the first news ... news team had arrested the masked man murder case in downtown San Diego in the president's\nYou know what is the one thing that John ... group is telling every single Democrat\nDo talk about it have it get off the topic of the immigration\nI don't think they want to talk about Kevin I either I don't think they really want to talk about raising taxes either but that is they're still out there saying they want their crumbs back\nBut that's part of their plan and I I I ... they use the generic terms bumper sticker slogan for health care but the bottom line is they gave us the single worst decision the country has ever made on health care in this country\nThe single worst it's Obamacare what the problem is if you like your doctor keep your doctor your like your plan to keep it blamed you'll get you get paid\nYes and it never worked out that way for any body and frankly Republicans this was their moment and look we got rid of the individual mandate\nIn Nineteen days we can create a system of health care second to nobody in the world\nThat's why for seven years I have harassed and bother poor Josh ... atlas MD Wichita, Kansas not only do I put them on radio and TV oh no that's not enough I set up meetings with him he flies to Washington on his own that we should pay him\nYou know for that I'll probably get accused of something if I offer to pay for something\nI'm been oh we should fund the effort fifty dollars a month on limited concierge hair he did go sheets ... directly with pharmaceuticals that Ninety five percent reduction in each team of therapy got breast cancer or for a lot of those drugs it's six dollars a treatment\nGood luck getting those places anywhere we couldn't institutionalized this\nAnyway so there's ... there's not running on what they believe we've learned that with Brett a sin in Tennessee things to project Vera toss we've learned with Claire McCaskill caught on undercover videos like this is our ages we needed arresting said investigation to watch\nThe fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whatever I Need to say to get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them then go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win if they do find who they really are they can't win if they give us their true agenda\nThey can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five and Pete forty five and Pete's forty five are claiming my timer claiming by the time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it ... now I don't want to talk about\nIt just don't say it they tell her she says they told me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment and lists never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now you have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want to open borders they calculated that's gonna benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision\nAnd every agenda item is about them wanting to hold onto power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well the only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven\nBy a borderline say honey hatred of this president they want to go back to what back to Obamacare they weren't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power forever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans that people\nAre going to talk about what the president's plenty of the ... that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs keep Obamacare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBecause after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to go out we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them\nThe crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what they do the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there you know house barber shops there Senate barber shops there Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves while they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate out system just for them very different\nSo that's what's at stake you're not going to tell you something about this border as I watch this caravan\nYou've got to understand this is a about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years\nAnd I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site antidote you've told us that before yeah I've been on horseback yeah bend and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah but on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated cast where they were headed to Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country\nIs this one you know one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was

streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks a pill well in some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of theirs while you're trying to heroin does much better ... totally ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it the light up in smoke it and then eventually going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the board of there's a new thing it's called ... and all\nYou

I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't gonna keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence\nA which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is it's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taking over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as a pension its intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth oh cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo\nAnd the federalist society with so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now\nIf you go back to Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and in the end I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they won in ... they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously have a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nI think that's right in this partly because I think if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that\nThey just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all and Carol van I think Kevin all the way they treated him

issues\nJust like the same information was used to obtain the price of warrants against Carter Page you can't make any of this up for people now saying Rod Rosenstein yeah he wanted to wear a wire on the president I'm James Baker is back on the hill today remember he was one of the four people\nThat was very clear about Rod Rosenstein and we're still awaiting the de classification of let's see

the center for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals it sounds complicated it really isn't\nIt is the single biggest abuse of power

civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown in Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and you know Carter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly ... feet deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you are really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the rise of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now if you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it just getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigation\nAbout things and they had happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government and hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and that I think we're getting into that as you've been a a all over in terms of your reporting so\nSo I bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roles called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation

litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone both with the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the\nProbably the most important point going on here Congress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work commission and good let's work\nAs a vital Congress to no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks I think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency and they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple mistake that have gone on you know we talk about this\nNinety nine page report on fire the court a abuses\nThat uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts and engender by law enforcement officers to invade the law there is by the way one author or as a new that no one really has exploited yet and that's a five a quarter of review\nThere is a court that just above the five to ... it will also under their rule for considered procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice of when you're right now that said just cabana sent telling talent in different circuits maybe ... maybe that
