first news at noon on cliff Albert in love with the ... we have special coverage on the big question at this hour who mailed suspicious and potentially dangerous packages to former President Obama and several other top Democrats\nI'm On almost every broadcast especially we have been covering it heavily\nI haven't been warning almost daily repeatedly someone is gonna get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing now the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what\nWe know today suspicious packages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program there was a story about George Soros apparently some devices but putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday\nMy statement on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros says home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list or George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on\nAlmost I you can see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their\nLeftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he is or racist it you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies oh the the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they weren't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe\nBomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and chaplain claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious Pakistan to Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore and watch it and happened to all these Republicans as any of this\nYou know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security in my life\nYou know Linda you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that\nWas sent I don't get packages anymore and my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happened it'd be go back just three weeks ago maybe people born in ...\nI've had enough I mean I can do I do I begin to tell the story about poor Elise how many lives lost she was quarantine for hours and it was like nine hours this horrible horrible and somehow we got no liberal media coverage\nYou know I look at it it's not about the coverage because you know but look we just had three weeks ago three weeks ago\nWe had rice and sent to Trump Mattis re Haspel\nI don't remember any coverage now and the case of any of this there were lunatics I'm going to prove that we get back that I'd been consistent and I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today from liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence\nIn the last month over the most serious issues of their supporters has been definitely will get to that end for Thirteen Days away from the most important election mid

send the phony fake pony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou [noise] hey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff\nOne thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and McCaskill have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this other guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nHeidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your mom poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes as what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing and each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be several liberate once you get selected that staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told that they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's protests are it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that if we do it tossed we confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were you know very cheering and and hearing it\nTo just have integrity is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to want to moderate and that and they can only make one choice one\nBut he did not have a choice it's lying is is a a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state and well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I'd yeah I don't I don't it doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project their ties\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none at it it it turned out to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated is like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something I'm Sean if it's wrong for me to go undercover and record these folks\nSome suspicious looking boxes left in front of the downtown San Diego building housing the offices of the union Tribune newspaper drew more attention than they might have today\nThat's
