riots over the weekend in New York City and in Portland and it's getting ugly\nAnd I don't think it should surprise anybody in light of the rhetoric that we've been hearing about getting people's faces and create a crowd and when you create a crowd followed them into the department stores and restaurants and gas stations what do you think it's going to happen\nWhen those types of things are set and I'm not look at the end of the day people who are responsible for their own behavior but when you're when you see this we're going to look back here have Rand Paul's right and I'm right somebody's going to get severely hurt or killed in all of this\nAnd well they don't look at the signs and symptoms were all there and we'll think about Pam Bondi and what happened to her and secretary Nielsen and what happened to her and we'll think about oh other things like uh oh Sarah Sanders in our family and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife\nI mean at some point someplace somewhere something's gonna happen and if you didn't see it this weekend I mean you had a demonstration billed as a march for law and order\nIn the streets of Portland descending into chaos as you have rival political factions now breaking into a bloody brawls downtown Portland on Saturday Night yet members of some group called the Patriot prayer I've never heard of them and\nTheir their black

in with hard a knuckle gloves knives firearms earlier in the evening why didn't they do something about it\nWell he said to make one arrest Saturday Night not one but they're investigating this scene is unfolding in mid tensions among both groups are fueled by impart uh some national news stories you had the marching in Portland against the police were brutality last week drew headlines after law enforcement's\nYou know they had a hands off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver which was caught on tape that outrage many including\nUs some leader of this group out there patriot prayer anyway a viral law video surfaced showing in New York City members of the group which I also never heard of Proud Boys some type of male chauvinist\nOrganization a beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at a Republican headquarters\nSo what do you have is you know I Know the media has been reporting that there were a group of white supremacist I don't I don't know anything about them\nBut there was a a hate rally at Republican headquarters in New York City anyway where\nYou know the way the media is portraying it I just have no idea 'cause I don't have it but of courting to the Daily Caller and people members actually vandalized the metropolitan Republican club in New York I had a an appearance of\nThis group Proud Boys prompting an outbreak of violence they're fascinating that Andrew Cuomo the governor up for re election in New York is not going to have any trouble my opinion sadly he's blaming you know Donald Trump he blamed president after antifa attacked the Republican headquarters in New York City\nUm the Southern Poverty Law Center has a history of of swearing Republican

without man you don't know when you're a scientist you aren't scientists have said disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nMight have said now I've seen the hurricane situations I changed my mind that really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact\nWhen it when I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back and we're talking about nine years and they said that we had hurricane that was far worse than what we just had with Michael says that they say I mean they say that in the ... what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever\nShow me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda like I Can't answer is also have a political agenda\nWhere was that angle of the the altered climate change data it's science was as Al Gore and others would tell you if it was so surely perfect there's no disagreement than the scientific community it's just not sure why would they have to alter the data back at that time\nBy the way the job of started listening and he heard that he's about to lose his mind or am I why do I know and the president was down visiting the devastation left by Michael ... hurricane you call that a thousand percent right I think up to now we've lost Nineteen people is the latest number I heard but you know thankfully most people listen and got out\nA job of stories with weather bell dot com that that annoyed you I Know right\nChain of all of my my interviews the ... she went to debate the president she didn't want to interview the president she wanted to debate them\nFirst of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had near record snowfall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold\nPeriod of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties and nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process so the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal skillful\nAnd near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland was it that way so right on Antarctica\nSo so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking ... record breaking high about five six years ago then they came down below and your back your normal now let me let me say this to president answered the question perfectly here's why\nUp until now\nClimate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so did her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally I feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now\nYou know whether they ever anybody else better than anyone else I mean I ... when you look back at the earth's temperature as that go out and cooler than warmer in the warmer than cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me get Leslie for\nIf if she's listening if you are listening will give you for example intensified more rapidly than Michael right off the top of my head Nineteen thirty five hurricane went from a tropical storm to a category five and thirty six hours hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine\nCame eleven days across the Atlantic it's a tropical wave\nForty eight hours later a category five hurricane fill your with a hundred and eighty miles an hour wind gusts Corpus Christi went from a hurricane a category one to a category four and a twenty four hours coming into Corpus Christi Nineteen Seventy\nGuarda in Nineteen sixty nine when over the Nantucket light trip with a hundred and twenty five mile an hour winds thirty six hours people were fifty mile an hour tropical storm and that's way up in the north Atlantic they're countless examples of rapid feedback development it was a textbook case for it and it's amazing watching this go on in front of my eyes\nAnd the the er twenty six team\nBut individual taxes are paid by thinking about this the top three percent pay the majority of everything the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes and literally then the bottom Ninety percent one percent pays more than Ninety percent\nThe top fifty percent paid all the taxes Ninety seven percent we have redistribution the bottom fifty percent of Americans only pay three percent of the bill that's it\nThe individual income tax system is designed to be progress if it is it is redistribution of wealth we already have the system and then when you get a little bit of your ... back because the ... the only ones that are getting ... back or people that pay\nYou know but for the middle class that's a lot of money one and two thousand dollars and they say you want the crumbs back is ridiculous so there's a lot\nGoing on this election and twenty two days now I Would argue that what your tax savings is on the ballot\nThe American economy is on the ballot are great comeback is on the ballot jobs are on the ballot your kids jobs in future is on the ballot your wages and for one case that's on the ballot\nYour business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot in all the biggest challenge is who's in charge of the future is going to be ... or you're going to elect\nAnd get to continue the Trump agenda go to tax cuts work dot com and they'll

out worked before November quick break right back we'll continue\nOn the Hannity [noise]\nRadio stick\n[noise]\nHi Michelle ... one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit got now how the woman goes into a clinic\nRod Rosenstein now as for people that have identified him as saying that he wanted to wear a wire against the president of the United states of America in the hopes that they could somehow use that tool in both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd then of course he decided he doesn't want to testify under oath even in a recording session which is what they normally do\nIt before Congress last week and he doesn't show up all the information that has been subpoenaed now with the obstruction continues and you just heard Jim Jordan articulate what that is that means the size of warrants to three oh Tuesday gang of eight information\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying that indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a trust a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence while we do that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the CIA\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton it paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally begin to get to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so\nJason Chaffetz is with us former congressman now on Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your wheel house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue is the peanut when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or maybe I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\n... the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is Marco Wyatt market why it was ...\nHe was capital for the dance the he was counsel for Hillary Clinton he was canceled for a ... group he was involved there this this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can do is threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey make and show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers on and I hope they send your talking to your former French and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take that said and I don't care if they're not going to\nEnforce the subpoena because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena used a peanut first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine's you didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene in Houston peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it or say that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be unproductive and we'd have a chance to see the ... orange the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys and I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get them to pay his but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael ... Mr his liar and said\nOr all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or am I stick and that you see a cue\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of American citizen on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information what conversations of George ... were intercepted and in the course of intercepted in the conversation\nThey found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information\nTo the by the court\nKnow it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all and by the way even her lover Peter structure at the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something that there is no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in\nAnd what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing
