on Wall street today but first a history making hurricane makes its arrival hurricane Michael making landfall late this morning our time\nThis one came in full force or as was predicted by our own job of started he was going to join us at the bottom of this half hour and actually is going to sustain a lot of its power it's going to make a\nA north easterly turn\nA it'll be a little south of Atlanta Atlanta is not going to get the brunt of this at some point tomorrow but Gus the is going to be hit really really hard so draw a line from Panama City Beach Florida straight to Augusta, Georgia and if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael\nAnd it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast through Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina\nAnd then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline had five hurricane and the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher um over a million power outages we expected occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak rainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat\nInto the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make their preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with your pack the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know thoughts and prayers with everybody in harm's way today this is this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you they're leaving it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this is one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow\nSame thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he was involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may a twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim combing he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth Pfizer\nApplication to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page or the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by\nAnd of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legally spends now\nHe was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information something from the president\nThat could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as Mick Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to find a civil warrants that as an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences\nWell we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you'd think they would have figured out that the dusty a was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true it's just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially fights application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol

left wing Democrat\n[laughter] it'd be the end of the world so I think her level of intensity and emotional was right because she's actually sending a signal the of course this is what this is about\nWant a future where the the Hillary Clinton's and and the and the congresswoman waters and people like Nancy Pelosi defined your future\nOr do you want a future in which you have the power

well as I Do there's only been three times in the last hundred years where the party that when the White House ends up picking up seats\nIn in Congress and their first midterm election now the last time that that happened was after the nine eleven attacks in two thousand and two\nAnd I think the country was so unified at that moment that there was no desire to change of power in any way shape or form I think before judge Kavanaugh I was a little worried about the enthusiasm gap that existed between Republican voters democratic voters\nAre that gap has now closed completely and in most instances when there's a tie that means that's a huge advantage for Republicans because pollsters don't tend to get that right\nNow you mentioned I Do want to keep samples of why the next few weeks you're going to become Republican weeks Kevin McCarthy just introduced a bill that says basically look here's your choice\nYou want to stop ... an hour from killing people going to stop carfentanil is

I Believe now firmly that you know all the people that have been claiming a blue wave a blue wave and blue wave can be shocked again just like they weren't twenty sixteen and they were only a couple of us that believe that that was even possible\nAnd ah I think one indicator of just how far left the Democratic party has gone is out in California the sanctuary state of California Gavin knows new

hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to\nHave a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews and those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers

states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent

do I need to give out the numbers are Trey Gowdy his office\nAnd chairman Goodlatte solvers in say call these men and demand that they subpoena under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why that would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWill uh hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact that you're covering it you're listening interests and the people that the truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat\nAnd understand how important it is but the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work today a tea to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that\nUh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI had not a song we need to see that we need to see and don't take an after every time Bruce or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact ... percent yup yup and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve adult\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe ... all those documents as well\nThat would include the McCain number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nCheated at a trance parents he gave us the information that we need to see and more importantly the American people need to see\nI'm ... you you watch the tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy has been showing that Republicans up more enthusiasm the Democrats and the lead up to the mid term elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic focal folk kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back down we're going to back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility well\nI think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nAh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want board Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nEnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage or not all but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come\nI mean new lows in politics Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on\nA on a regular basis for Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA V. investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which you've been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\n... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans wanna\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from governor officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like what Kevin McCarthy introduced which was a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he couldn't make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is the latest one that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker of all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talked about surreptitiously taping the president\nThe United states in the hopes of getting something on tape that that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThose are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict having written a letter and recommended the firing James Comey the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have on redacted and released the American people that hasn't happened yet and the same guy that appointed Robert Mueller\nAh why wouldn't they wanna testify Greg Jared under oath\nDoesn't want to transcribe the interview or anything under oath which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does this leave and the lie with impunity without putting in self\nIn legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really want to say oh you know Mr good lot let's just you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein or July as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement a Congress he's not looking at perjury because he can always deny the conversations that good ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nOr they've got they've got a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put on my own and these answers have given but uh I got to let you bumped or do we write great job great Jared congrats on the successor the rush of ... new book is out right now it Spygate the attempted sabotage Donald J

to me the if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually a we put it out publicly with the Patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning\nTelling people that it's going to be a look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay\nSo you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern coming in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of a big golf store\nRight now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show but and you could see the pattern setting up\nEverything got together and that's why you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective I guess is the worst storm ever to hit between mobile and camp I that I can find on records okay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something it was so we're not sugarcoat that\nBut on the other hand it's not because of your SUV All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you can see this pattern setting

as if it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they go out to go in and look at the damage\nBut there's a lot more or less of this storm folks\nBecause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia\nThat'd be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ...
