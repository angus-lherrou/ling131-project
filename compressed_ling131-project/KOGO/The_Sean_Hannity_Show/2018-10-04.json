are defending Al Franken\nAnyway we'll see in the political fallout of all of this now is Kavanaugh's now the president's approval rating has an all time high at fifty percent today and the president laying out the facts in this particular case we've got an election in thirty three days\nAnd every poll is now showing that the Senate races in the enthusiasm gap is heightened dramatically and significantly which is the right thing why because\nI think the American people are learning a lot that this is the Democratic party playbook\nIs a party that doesn't believe in due process or presumption of innocence there's a party that regularly smears Flanders\nUses character assassination character blood Janine all in the process to gain their own power is not one agenda item that you can cite any Democrat that they're running on and thirty three days that's going to make the country a better place they don't seem to care at all at what they've done with\nJudge Kavanaugh or when you look at the evidence and you look at the facts as the FBI did now they're attacking the FBI what do you find out is that there is zero corroboration\nTo the claims of all three women in the ... not even including\nThe cases of outright lying that were dismissed\nEarly on about judge Kavanaugh they just dismiss it altogether but none of this would ever make it into any court of law and there might actually end up being significant legal consequences to Julie sweat Nick and some other people based on what Alan Dershowitz and others saying should happen\nBecause of the things that they said the backtracking that took place and perhaps even lying\nUnder the threat of a felony anyway news roundup information overload our Jonathan Gillum author or sheep do more Danielle McLaughlin is with

the way a wad of this stuff is playing out in Washington DC right now or whether it be the boxing that we've seen 'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used and I think what's happening is\nIt's solidify and people that they don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome in the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west um they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause a backlash\nAre you going to defend
