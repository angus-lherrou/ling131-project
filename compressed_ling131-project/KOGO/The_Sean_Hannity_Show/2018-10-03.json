do it [noise] um so we'll see\nAnd you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation\nYou know what I Want to get into what this whole means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is\nThat obviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it\nThose that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nTherefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this and I think the American people have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with\nRemember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just gonna say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know then we learned about Mrs Ramirez in the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people\nThey found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nKnow that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that\nShe had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event then the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in the cereal\nTrucking almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as you said almost on a weekend basis what happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up\n... and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person a backup or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is and they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues\nOf the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying\nWell well they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in Brett Kavanaugh I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happened that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that yeah but the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident from Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nHe's police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight why he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just fall a fine for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nJuly we need and has the ins because there are a lot of allegations at any point really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that\nWe got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett cabin on that particular case\nAnyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claim the Ford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day she said there were four people\nThat could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point\nYou've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now\nBased on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor forward but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that\nThey're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed she just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise] um you know it's just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into\nWhat this all means because what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor forward and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves and we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way a democratic protesters by the way of salt that a GOP congressmen in his

and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't discuss I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nI I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney Adam paid taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney the way there is no we won the election what's the difference and the ... by the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel just\nSide and whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this\nThey have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt\nAnd now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and whereas Jeff snowflake gonna vote\nAt writing down to three I mean

had\nLike ... or ... or San I named him here that we might not ... ... ... and I say that because I it and he said that Democrats\nUp because they have clinical calculation didn't mind you have your

can't or ... or ... not vote for that nominee don't ever get people to get their God that they might get out of their own political okay in a factory right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man\nThat would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nGet real wrong principle is man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater the conscience of the conservative ... and ... you\nKnow if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter] you are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime\nAll right that is the thank you both for being with us he couldn't get enough teen votes I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state\nRace it off to the northeast New Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and its own nobody's interested in the guy that says though I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters they

and they were ... girls almost on a weekend basis I went to ten of these parties myself and and he's one of them and and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were\nGang rape train raped as they were lying in the hall\nAnd then that falls into while I saw him near the punch bowl\nAnd and I saw him give red solo cups the people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um\nThat is so over the top and the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases no car operation not the case of professor Ford\nNot the case of Mr Ramirez and not the case with Julie sweat Nick know co-op corroboration\nJoe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing\n... have you back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody or we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rapes somebody that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nUh the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers how they you know how soon we all forget about these things but it I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey\nCasey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a wild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general of California is she supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts is there no just corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweat neck in particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations um\nYou know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we have now examined every\nSingle case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has happened who's truly sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that miss what may\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate ... for her story there is no substantiate issued permits Ramirez story\nAnd I just want to say something that I Know uh probably throwing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied him like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe a Senator Grassley I think Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise that remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes together a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah cats that were cast by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with\nBill Clinton and it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I ... I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ... I didn't know that but that was very nice of you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why what's her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that if she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe\nYou know 'cause we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think the Republicans credit they took these allegations and charges seriously\nThey handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do but for the Democrats they just they just now have pushed this so far into it it ...\nInto any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nOh I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume it's probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and is and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believed everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is non existent shorter than happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make\nAnd let him trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they ... they're which music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned that music up so nobody could hear her\nAnd then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are many flaws in what she does say\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into\nThat whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next and then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean\nHey listen if you have sunspots well our friends at Shawnee ingenious so they came
