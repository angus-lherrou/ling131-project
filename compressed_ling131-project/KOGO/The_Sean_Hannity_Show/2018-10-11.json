became the nicks okay the second wave feminists are ...\n... points and spreading worldwide feminism based on denigrating men met trivialize when men have done a defining men as as a practicing tyrants their history okay in absolute lie there hadn't been crimes against women where they have occurred we must condemn them\nThroughout history have given their lives and their land or from the

uh we had a lovely time that night so [noise] just just\nAmazing as it is and I it took me a while to figure out you know what they were what they were doing with this I was naive back in those days

there are people I Need to tell you there are people wondering if this is the October surprise because you know early voting is happening now\nAnd as the stock market goes down the media loves to talk about the Trump it caught on me may have to opt out and we may be headed back to our Obama reality some some such thing\nSo there are suspicions this is all being manufactured in other words leftist willing to take a financial hit in order to try to hurt Trump\nDon't know about that but we'll see Kenya and folks back for open line friday and Monday one hour [noise]\nAnd every single thing that we've been telling you about the Democrats not being a party that has solutions are answers to problems\nUh have now gotten infinitely worst\nIs way beyond what they do every two in in four years Republicans racist you know my whole list by now uh we have a tough race by the way it's going to be a tough race\nFor Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think he's done a phenomenal job a as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people who Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort or with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely\nUm in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well is that what fifty one percent and rest musician and so we'll watch that but I think if\nYou look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should've been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television and we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are going to make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives I mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats I ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now um\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent\nIf they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it\nIf they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera\nWere just going to have a better country\nAnd and more prosperous country you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nWhat if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share and NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that NATO's trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world\nAnd I got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies and on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I Want to get in Michelle Obama was on the today show earlier today and an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments

then we'll be civil or you've got to be kidding when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fear is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid to their neighbors and\nDemocrats have a ... a monopoly of compassion for minorities

Barbie the butcher of early on in France headed the Bolivian Secret Service and that's actually a secret police\nAnd he was responsible for tracking down and murdering shade war vohra\nUnbelievable Castro's right hand man those are the kinds of things that are all over killing the ss so if people are interested in history they're interested in in this Holocaust which every American and the younger people don't know anything about it so by this book read it and then slap it into the hands of some twenty two year old\n[laughter] and yeah I got to\nTell you one thing because there's something happening in history we have a moment to thread a needle like we've never had before and out of fear of rainy and had Gemini we have an unprecedented an alliance that is emerging the United states Israel are\nThe closest ally in the middle east the Jordanians the Egyptians the Saudis are putting aside the issues with Saudi Arabia today and the Emirates and they're all uniting sharing intelligence and recognizing\nThe evil that is the uranium mullahs chanting death to Israel death to America\nAnd fomenting terror the number one state sponsor of terror\nBut meant for mending proxy wars all around the region\nAnd this might be the opportunity to create that piece in the middle East that has been a base of or ever I that's what I see is a potential possibility\nThere is a possibility there that the Iranian people themselves the Persians will um I've had enough and we'll take out the mothers who are persecuting not only them what anybody else that they don't like\nUm the mall is no different than a Third Reich I mean the revolutionary guard in Iran at this moment it's no different than the ss it's the same mentality will kill you and we don't care you're infidels I'm so yes you're right there is an opportunity now I'm going to take a lot of leadership\nAnd a lot of guts and um we can't put John Kerry in ... in charge of it a ... so just we cannot put the\nLaws just sense of humor as soon as I Know\nNow it's Long Island thing you know\nNow well listen I I'm very impressed with the book a whole series is impressive it's the best selling a history series in history\nSo I don't want to get lectures from anybody you know well now we see people you know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz a Mitch McConnell a you know I guess the the angry mob now getting into people's faces like they've been told to do by Maxine Waters Cory Booker and others\nAnd I think Rand Paul's right that this is not going to end well somebody who's going to get hurt or killed in the process\nA Danielle and it's one big lie that they go high because the Democrats have never gone high they've always gone low\nGrade at nothing will happen and I agree with you to watch it that we're seeing this escalation of rhetoric which care about\nAnd I do want to say about what they called it cuts here this morning quite as being caught it you know he is he going to say I mean do we do anything inappropriate we don't have anything to cash to fight\nAnd they can envy the radar for the president that people respond to I think that's happening on the wealth station genetically and so I think many Democrats are looking at it and when you see how far\nAre we going to get a new line but it's never been the case Jonathan I mean that's why we chronicled us every two and four years and I think we saw the worst of the worst with judge Kavanaugh you know immediately I Believe\nI I think people that make serious allegations like was made in the case of professor port they've got to be listened to but she gave the names of people including an eye witness that didn't corroborate their story\nYou you know the problem we're we're we're having now Sean is that we don't just have the same rhetoric that politics have every year we also have activists out there we have um\nDifferent groups like ... and a bottle means necessary be am in ... these people are actively going out and causing fear and intimidation using violence as we saw in Portland, Oregon when you combine all these things\nThe the rhetoric the violence\nThe on the ground in your face type of stuff is there going and intimidating the politicians and ah then speakers when they're out eating what you're seeing\nIs an escalation far beyond just rhetoric which we've had before and even when you have somebody like Dr Ford given testimony it gets mass gets covered up whether it's serious or real there's evidence or not this stuff gets so covered up by a motion\nUm and they've gotten completely out of control now to a point where\nThere there is no truth I mean you look at these statements that Eric Holder made you can't double speak you can't say kick people and then say let's not do anything illegal that's double speak\nBut Daniel loses bend your party name one thing that the your Democratic Party you're below party is offering the American people besides impeachment endless investigations keeping the failure of Obamacare wanting the crumbs back of the tax cut open borders eliminating ice what what what are they going to do for the\nMen and women in this country\nUm after eight years of failure with rock Obama what are they gonna what are they offering what are they running on except hatred\nYou know the different again I I take Craig's list and conditions Medicare and Medicaid and care that environment or they don't want nothing\nOkay what are they gonna do they had eight years uh Brock Hussein Obama as president\nThirteen million more Americans on and on food stamps have more in poverty\nAccumulated more debt than every other president before him combined the lowest labor participation rate since the Nineteen seventies and the only president in history never to reach a three percent GDP GDP Growth than a year\nYou know they had that they had the football they they they ran backwards the country went backwards now we got eight million Americans out of poverty for a million or food stamps\nFor a million jobs manufacturing jobs all almost five hundred thousand of those those are jobs Obama set of never coming back why should anybody vote Democrat 'cause all we hear is as lies negativity et cetera et cetera\nNot George W. Bush and collect ended up\nTalking about what what what are they are offering\nToday forget about George Bush he beat that ... that's a century ago what are they offering people now and how they change from the Obama years what did they offering besides I hate Donald Trump\nWon but like I said we had we care about in any case we hear that and\nI we got a bad line again I haven't been to China than what is it\nKnow suddenly you just said a second ago about it how long ago George Bush was in office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter is the fact that\nHere and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that\nBut we we have rhetoric in Washington DC\nThat is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if they are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college change the number of Supreme Court justice is ridiculous\nWhy that and it's how do you become a party that doesn't even believe in simple due process the constitution presumption of innocence I you know how how do you become a party that is now noted for\nYou you know people in your party confronting people in in restaurants women Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders you can't you can't even go have a bite to eat without being confronted now\nIn in that in those Thirty years you see I wash interviews where people are they're asking young people if they're going to vote there going to say there's they know because they're not really into this you have been in the middle of his wife was out doing law enforcement you weren't integrated into all this politics\nHave you yourself ever seen ... at the Democratic party ever leave any sense of normalcy of what this country is all about I mean I remember when Reagan was in office the Democrats\nSay they would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out the Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick Morris and others\nTo move to more to the center right\nAnd we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton assign it\nAnd it worked but it was more at a political necessity than any any principles that that he held deeply liberalism is a failed law the ideology that never works it\nSeemed great on paper free health care free daycare free free free you know we got this guy running out
