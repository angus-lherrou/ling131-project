quiz what one positive thing is any Democrat either running for the Senate or the house where you live\nWhat are they running on that they want to do to make this world this country a better more secure more prosperous home for us our kids our grandkids to create more jobs more opportunities what are they offering\nWhat are they offering to secure the borders if anything what we're watching now is one of the biggest lie this information propaganda campaigns this is now the Democratic party\nHillary Clinton campaign Bernie Sanders fair and square she's got a sheet they got a stack the deck and Bernie that it just being a dummy just took it and when the whole the whole thing was rigged against him from the get go\nDown even right now [laughter] I don't know\nOkay suddenly ... soon as possible Democrats this is what we're now\nWitnessing and this is not unprecedented I've been in this business radio Thirty years I've been in t._v. I just started my twenty third year\nThey'll play book is the exact same every two four years Republicans are racist sexist massage units\nDino phobic Islamic phobic homophobic they weren't dirty air water they want to kill your children and some look alike of your Congress man or woman is going to throw your grandmother over the cliff\nNow they've even taking it a step further than that you have the center\nFor American Progress which is John Podesta says oh group he created this thing and another think tank I've never heard of the third way\nThey're fighting Democrats what they should do and not do and the lead up to the election what they should say what they should not say spend as little time as possible talking about immigration\nDon't tell the people the truth about immigration sanctuary attacks ... pack up punch it says that a memorandum oh okay New York times got a copy of this thing\nDemocrats the strategy is preparing the memo board by using all Democrats that they could neutralize the attacks if they responded but they should spend as little time as possible talking about immigration itself instead\nPivot to more fruitful issues like by the way health care and taxation for healthcare means he pulled bombing care I don't know how that's fruitful for them\nLook you know keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less that hasn't worked out very well people millions lost their doctors their plans and they're paying two three four times what they were ones paying and the only thing they want on taxation is oh they they they want\nYou know they use the rhetoric\nYou know redistribution tax cuts for the rich the reality is\nAh that's never been true in half the country only pays three percent of the tax bill\nThe latest numbers came I was in Bloomberg yesterday\nTop three percent of Americans pay the majority of taxes in this country to top three percent\nTop one percent pay forty percent\nThe top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of the total individual income taxes let me say it another way the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers only pay three percent of the tax bill that's it\nYou know which small percentile of taxpayers you know also paid three percent or more well you know if you look at the top fourteen hundred taxpayers one thousand four hundred people in a country of three hundred plus million people\nThat group alone pays a massive share of fourteen hundred people pay nearly ... percent of the taxes just just fourteen hundred people\nTwo thousand one bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent now it's down to three percent that's it you have this progressive tax system that they want but it's still not enough they want their crumbs back\nThey're not going to tell you Maxine Waters see Jason if you can find the cut Maxine Waters said they don't they keep telling me not to say it they don't want\nMe to compare what you're dealing with what we have in Washington DC\nOffice as a wake up in the middle of the night and all I can think\nWe should not think about how somebody else has done to deal with this is all of our by\nI say I'm a little side on the side and I'm not going to move\nHost you know there's a difference how some of our leadership talk about how we handle all of this vaccine please don't say impeachment anymore [laughter]\nI'll say impeach [laughter]\nAnd they didn't they say Maxine don't say it in other words we we we agree but we're not telling people what we want to do when I'm going to we're not going to ... we just want to keep it quiet well we're going to do well that's what\nThe center for American Progress is recommending they doing immigration\nIt's very difficult to it on immigration with vulnerable vulnerable votes in states that Trump carried in twenty sixteen the strategy memo goes on arguing even the most draconian of Republican policies like family separation threats to deport dreamers undocumented immigrants cetera et cetera\nFailed to sway most voters\nEmphasis added let me interpret this for you Maxine being quiet don't tell the people the truth of what we're really going to do\nDon't talk about immigration don't tell them we want to eliminate I stop saying it don't tell them you won't open borders keep lying to them you know we've got Claire McCaskill we got an unbelievable tape that we're going to play at the top of the next hour would project merit tops remember last week we had\nYou know former governor of Tennessee reticent and the people in his office\nBasically saying we're only saying publicly were voting for Kavanaugh stuff he'd never do it\nWe just need to get these Republican voters we need to bamboozled them we need to manipulate them we need the propagandize them in light of them tell them whatever they want to hear but when he gets in office he's going to do the right thing\nAnd the tape that we ... we revealed last night on Hannity well more of this tonight at nine\nIt's better if you see we're going to play in the next hour but McCaskill on tape of course she's going to vote for gun bans in our campaign staff yes course she wants to semi automatic rifle ban you know she's quiet on gun views because he has a bunch of Republican voters\nBut if this tape revealed she seek relief supports gun control groups\nHer staff says you we got to wait until after election to bring up Trump impeachment you\nKnow to voters to listen if they don't understand why we won't say they need to get over it you know people just can't know\nThat ... McCaskill end up ... Obama they have the same view on everything it's all in this tape people just can't know that they actually are heard were campaign guy saying and McCaskill's office\nWell they're all this is why campaign you cannot anybody in this program you can't list what they stand for\nNobody in the media ever told you what eight years of Obama did to this country maybe that's why I sound like a broken record Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps after eight years you kidding me you want to go back to that\nEight million more in poverty the worst recovery since the forties lowest participation rate since the seventies lowest homeownership rate in fifty one years\nYou know we had the only president ever in history not to reach three percent GDP Growth than a year\nWe just had four point two percent the last quarter under Trump the only president that you know said nine trillion in debt the irresponsible unpatriotic well he accumulated more debt than all forty three presidents before him combine\nAll of this is on the ballot and I haven't even mentioned the fact that President degraded defeated eighty percent of ISIS that the president stop little rocket man from firing his rockets every other day over Japan and threatening the entire region with with a nuclear war\nOr forget the fact that he's he kept his promise on trade deals on pipelines on deregulation and more is open the coal industry has been saved he spent three and a half billion dollars on the wall he promised is fighting for the other twenty five million\nAnd they gave us the biggest tax cut in American history and to originalist justices no other president ran on the idea that\nHe'd keep originalist on the Supreme Court and he got it done\nLet me just say more simply [noise] if you don't get your ass out to vote then gets half a vote for polo see in the house and hand from both ... if you got to senator up in your state\nIf you vote for a Democrat you might as well just vote for below sea 'cause that's what you're getting\nAt first crews arrived at three and found heavy plane coming from old story building which has residential on top and then a bit and it turned out to be the

America is teenage versus the crimes that they are kidding she workers to combat potentially going so pathetic\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [laughter]\nIn the face of from Congress\nPeople eliminating I for instance and President Trump\nHas strayed so far from the interest in the American people and the interest of humanity uh we need to we need to abolish it\nWhen the American people learn that some of them are not getting anything some of them getting rate and the rest are getting from and big corporations and wealthy individuals are getting nice ... pieces of pie they're going to be outrage they are already [laughter]\nIce isn't doing what it was created to do it's being used as his own personal a police force and in those actions is actually making us less safe when\nThis country understand and fails what has been done with a tax scam or and what that's going to do for our deficit in this country it's gotta be reverse\nAnd I think we imagine and during the agency with a very different mission and take those commissions out and so we believe that\nWe can protect families that need our help and that is not what I think today and that's why I Believe you should get rid of what\nWe have proposed as an increase in the corporate tax rate\nYour body cabinets [laughter]\nThank\nWe read our immigration system from something that we're more\nMedicare for all it's actually much more is actually much chipper going to crash that will pay right now\nI'm not saying please don't say impeachment anymore\nSay impeach if [laughter]\nIf it turns out that he does become justice Kavanaugh and your chairman of the house Judiciary Committee which you investigated for possible appeasement if he is on the Supreme Court\nAnd the Senate has investigated than anything else will have to do investigate we have to investigate\nI twenty four till the top of the hour oh that is the agenda nonstop investigation impeachment oh don't tell anybody Maxine ... thought they keep saying don't say it but I'm going to say don't talk about immigration\nDon't even mentioned you want the crumbs back don't mention you want to eliminate ice but we have all the tape\nJust like Britain is in the British and yet you know the project Vera toss cameras are inside their whole trust us She's not voting for Kavanaugh he's just saying that the get rural voters he only wants to be there one term in when he's there he's just going to do what's right he never vote that way\nI don't think the people of Tennessee appreciate the fact that Brett as soon as a total fake phony in a fraud\nWas Claire McCaskill\nIs as well as we expose last night with project ... another part we have that will air tonight on TV James O'Keefe is going to join us I mean it's I mean when they're literally saying um oh listen listen because people can't know but of course Claire andme Obama they have the same views on everything\nWhat a gender the proposing that you like what what what are they offering you the Democratic party that you find the practice because we have news out today that\nWe can add to the four hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs that weren't coming back to four plus million new jobs that have been created in less than two years the eight million out of food stamps and poverty the past recovery we've seen best gene in such a long time\nWhen he was a new one today consumer confidence at an all time high number job openings in the U.S rose slightly oh and a record low unemployment three point seven percent record low on that I mentioned record low unemployment and fourteen states\nWe have James O'Keefe when we get back where do you hear what the lives of false representations not only governor bread or send in Tennessee now he's got Claire McCaskill on tape\nJoke country will talk about how fraudulent invested the media isn't the feeding Trump by the way I see the rapper TI taken aim at Trump and Kanye West and the music video featuring baloney as a stripper\nWelcome to your Democratic Party by the way the only\nThing we learned in the DNA test of Elizabeth Warren is she's Ninety six percent European Cherokee Nation was furious\nBy the way you know and people just mocking her but anyway\nHundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number even that MSNBC reporter said I might is just I might be just as Native American and she is one in one one thousand in ...\nTwenty four and yet you change your your status to minority at one school and harbors promoting or as the purse Native American woman ever to teach professor at Harvard\nUnbelievable [noise] All right I Want to remind you look\nLife lock they're going to protect your good name your finances\nYour credit your credit you know when people take it out credit cards and loans and your name you don't want people ruining your finances robbing you blind your bank your retirement accounts\nFBI's warning everyone who gets paid through direct deposit be on the lookout for fishing emails requesting personal information including a log in it for credentials to bank accounts but those those credentials will be used to change bank account information\nI mean [noise] I mean this is going to be\nPart of our when\n\nThis is Glen Winfrey another McCaskill campaign staffer the way he details a plan for impeachment of President Trump is revealing\nSo here's a route\nHolds up on the moderate [noise]\nWhat are we talking a modern NAFTA redrawn them region hammer\n\n\n\n[noise] and all of you know\n\nWe discovered that McCaskill is receiving money from democratic US Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nLet me get money from ... to our inland pack okay\nAnother one of those things where we get the money and mind you know keeping on the deal yeah I was not fly fundraising for\nI Will take the money [laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they asked to unless they specifically ask is she voting for the wall we should let them go they need to think that so I think she's facing the wall and they don't ask me and then let them think that\nAnd if they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment just shut up about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWhen I can help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course you would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly shoes that she supports say hey gun control group you know in our staffers saying well we'll wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAn Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses Scott this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn now by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line oh he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what we what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a wide campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power and it's being exposed to very high level I mean this is really\nYou know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people a tendency in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing these senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see there's great job yeah\nSean this is a pattern you know we release the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate rather than you know responded by fumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but one of those powerful pieces which when the sky Glenn Winfrey wanna McCaskill staffers\nTo our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we're going to mislead them and the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's the guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views no I confronted neck on the street yesterday with a microphone ethnic why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee it's true in North Dakota\nOh how nice red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so we're doing is exposed\nYou don't want you know what I disagree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty and embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think everybody on they're showing on TV\nIf you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a boat for Claire McCaskill or British thin or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nYou know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state the in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead and again this is a Greek chorus of staffer the staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is on us because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so tiny very interesting to see British\nThat his opponent the next month's election as a national security risk former congressman Duncan el hotter made the comments about Democrat um our capital jar at

would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nHealthcare is local I mean that's the important thing you know health care should be between you and your doctors\nAnd one thing that's clear the calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now if we wait for ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is to eliminate\nAny it asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our ...\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but as it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh ... grows the probably one of the defining issues

California both sides of the argument today at three mile report [noise]\n\nAll right I mean when you are\nBusy phones Nina is in San Francisco a cast a vote and you know Hi how are you glad you called\nMe for taking my car and going\nKnow when he could fan in California and flex landfill around it by the of crazy people I'm just wondering what are we going to take at California\nI got one gathering dark I mean I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he's written that hey\nListen I you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math\nAnd sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans are elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could win now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign in St free health care\nFor everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically our governor saying illegal or legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is taxed at Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income\nIf you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction but if people want to experiment with is that you know ... what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't really can and can't get on with the thinking gotta get out of California you can't afford to pay taxes on this [laughter]\nSo that people can tune in and literally see we've also put up an interactive map on Hannity dot com that people can use\nAnd you also see it Christ in cinema is imploding out in Arizona project Vera toss with the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on same happened a governor governor reticent and Tennessee\nHave Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble uh we now see hell are very important seed in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll only state I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response next to hurricanes I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott\nHas really shown if you're a member of showing the two thousand twelve election right here in Jersey that's for Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to a ... member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nA for Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday is and why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with our DNA\nNow he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nAround her neck that she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type\nI mean but it is but her she literally personally change herself to minority status when U. Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority\nFemale professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out they're outraged by it\nDry it and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate\nThis was a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals proof of Native American\nAncestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies and twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah no room to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but\nThey're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I think keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project ... tape with Claire McCaskill in our own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats in strategist to prepare the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo a more fruitful issues like health care and taxation\nIt's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their part Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent con be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have that's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reporter by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments\nTrump is winning right now he won with capital as well even the CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four\nForty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a if it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that she jobs coming back and companies coming back unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now\nHe's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball I always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him um I I look at these other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness\nClaire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her\nOr if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state Tennessee read stand\nBeside the way it's set it up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better or got more money than any cattle my gosh are eight million dollars I mean he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you got to think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how\nDemocrats don't win twenty three seats went back out and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty mid term I have got against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten so I was thinking you know what I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up at fifty fifty that Republicans keep asking if that happens\nAfter all this negative press that President Trump has received the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I I Will tell you I think the fact that you're you've hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members in and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say in it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some hackers on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the for people that Julie sweating except we're at those parties one dead or to wouldn't returned our calls in one didn't know who truly sweating to watch so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story and but also hurting on it but in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process and the presumption of innocence that's the way they lost that\nI got to run but Joe ... over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break
