there's ... tactics are\nSo if you want the progress that continue if you'll like where we're headed get your ass out of the chair and go vote\nThat's my advice to you\nEight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number now let's say you're in a chair and it's a vacation you don't have to get out of the chair that if you're a Mexico and let's say they're like Linda Fifteen or sixteen

because you thought you'd wanna shorter you'd be able to recapture\nThe same vacation every year for the rest of your life right forever young in Mexico and how many times have you been back to your time share that you would pay them a fortune for not not enough that's for sure once one once okay\nAnd you've been paying maintenance fees all the while forever young yes all my forever young and you have to pay him every year you're obligated now sadly what are the odds have you ever going back again\nA and an attempt to bribery or have backfired on her ... major steal her determination to make sure that Kavanaugh is being treated fairly with the presumption of innocence and due process she said\nThat is relevant to our advise and consent duty\nLet me ask you John sale I Know you've been in more than a few political battles in your life and we watched this process unfold\nI mean and it got worse and worse you know literally crushed Shenandoah wing at what when Michael ... represents a woman that claims almost on a weekend basis that young girls were more systematically drug boys lining up in the hall to rape them one after another and and that was a normal weekend\nAnd that would happen and not just one spoke multiple times and\nNo parent loan no law enforcement those teacher a was ever told ever all your years in the prosecutor's office would you be a bit suspicious of that story\nWell you'd be more than a bit suspicious I mean you just rejected out of hand but showing going forward there's something very special about the Supreme Court you know the fact that the confirmation was fifty to forty eight it's not like where I'm trying to be the point spread\nAdjust its now justice cabin on so long the judge Kavanaugh he was confirmed and the Supreme Court just must be above the fray and not send out political signals and I think the editorial he wrote we said the op ed that he was going to be independent an impartial\nObviously he will be and I just hope that it does not will the awful things that have happened in the last week did not affect the public's confidence in the independence of the Supreme Court\nWell I think it's going to be interesting and then what we have to ask the question will the party that was responsible for all of this\nWill there be a price to pay in twenty nine days\nWill ... I mean in other words I talk about every election Republicans a racist or sexist massage in his homophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill granny eye and roller over a cliff and they want to kill children well now with no coat hanger is being sent and\nAnd they're it's it's just the same tactics as\nThose tactics I think are backfiring on the Democrats and all of the activists and protesters and and these special interest groups the polling data Sean is very revealing there was some apathy among Republicans as is often the case in a midterm election\nAnd suddenly that changed and transformed GOP voters into energized and motivated voters to get out on\nElection day next month because she what is going to happen if they lose the house and the Senate because Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Adler who would then become\nA chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats win the house are vowing to a ... exact we're van ... a ...\nInvestigation to remove calving off those from the Supreme Court by virtue of articles of impeachment and and there's nothing that will motivate of Republican voters more\nIn that kind of what to undermine the Democratic process of confirmation and to try to stabilize the Supreme Court for partisan reasons\nIt's gonna be interesting to watch do you think politically John you watch a lot of campaigns is they're going to be as big as the American people going to be motivated in twenty nine days and are they going to remember this\nWell I Can't read the tea leaves but what we just saw with the confirmation battle actually was a an example of our separation of powers inaction were each branch exercise it's appropriate role and now in our\nDemocracy the people are going to decide and you know there are going to be irresponsible lawyers who are going to come\nGo on T. V. shows with more people who are claiming I should have been interviewed I could have told this town and I just hope that people can separate the wheat from the chaff\nAs a prosecutor looking at these three cases how would you handle them thirty six years later in each case no corroboration in each case\nUh well uh with I don't know anything beyond what's in the public record but without corroboration you might entertain a meeting for an hour or two and say thank you for coming by a there's nothing to talk about\nUm okay so when when professor ... for example she can't remember a location\nShe can't remember an exact date or a place not he's struggling to know the year in the case of ... Ramirez she's calling other fellow students from back in the day she's asking them if they remember because she's not sure she remembers\nA in the case of Julie sweat neck who who made the you know changed her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a hall maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you go if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for that\nOne nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there was\nCalifornia holding its only governor debate

I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work\nBrought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other into community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they liked you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments similar to any um international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted ... to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy to share\nInsights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact the food and does have a network of of their own deep state operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started ah I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh and listen first happened\nIn August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report ah I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of oil and the uh first Pfizer weren't ... I think my first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's when we said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at\nTime ... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI I remember you know in these longs\nStudents as powerful as they are on the American people\nI I fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy right so much is just undercover and you know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents\nYou know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations\nThey started saying well our bosses and want to [laughter] you know than they are I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the ... era as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever\n[laughter] don't go to a lot of ... Russia stay out well President Trump has done a lot to fix that situation I think you know those are his his courage I\nI'm inspired by that and I think there's even that is going to be fixed over time I'm confident order Paige thanks for being with us we always appreciate you being here eight hundred ... a number thank you sir\n[noise]\nNews radio six hungry go go live local\nSwearing in

J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking A M doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as much places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because\nThree of those guys were named and Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't think there's any doubt it there's no\nDoubt at all that the ...\nAnd in the hospital regime of Russia being him being the hostile actor that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and they're constantly cite\nCyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point we've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nYou know much intellectual property is stolen it's billions and billions of dollars from America's\nSame ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known oh Julian Assange is what it is mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D\nThat's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we haven't hired the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we gotta look inward and say uh maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\nI I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with with with this uh\nGive Jay indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is the color can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the O. J. has very detailed information\nUm I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty\nIt gets pretty in depth it's damning and you're right you know understand another thing\nIs that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody what happened in twenty sixteen now every other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "08"}
