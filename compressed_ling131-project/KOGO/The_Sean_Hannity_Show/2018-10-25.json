because he's basically the Chuck Schumer Donnelly of Indiana\nDoesn't represent Indiana values um and I think the president going there's going to help ah hopefully brought in Indiana a will be watching and waiting the whole time they don't let the let me tell you what the worst news is in the you know we've been watching all of this happen\nYou know all of this in civility that we've been monitoring and the silence is deafening it's just been especially deafening from Democrats and the news media\nThey've been unwilling to criticize things they obviously should criticize and it's been going on two years this this is not a new phenomenon it takes on different forms it all started with Donna I Wanna I Dream an awful lot about blowing up the White House\nAnd deteriorated from there and deniro wanting a punch the president in the face and Joe Biden wanting to punch the president take them either by then fight it out and Duke it out\nYou know this is the Democratic party Hillary

now being thrown through the office window of Kevin McCarthy the house majority leader\nI mean and it's been virtual silence\nAnd we have this terrible incident that we have been watching where you know these suspected mail bombs you know thank God of the ten that have been sent a they haven't even confirmed fully that they're real bombs I assume that they are thank God none of them went off\nBeing sent to several prominent Democrats around the country we do have one instance where Republican is being threatened we did up the the two instances of Minnesota with two Republican candidates were punched one guy got cold coffee from the ... behind that a concussion that's going to keep him out of commission for six weeks\nYou know we're living in times where the hypocrisy reeks the media Democrats they only care about Russia collusion if Russia collusion involves Donald Trump which it does not\nBut then when they see all the evidence emerging that Hillary bought and paid for\nRussian lies by funneling money too from a law firms to weigh up research group then hires a foreign national that makes that won't even stand by you know his ridiculous stories of hookers\nUrine ... beds in Moscow and Donald Trump years ago in under rosy says I Can't confirm any of this is just you know ... fifty fifty um it's raw intelligence what do I know\nAnd then that still becomes the

can't be Trump even by disseminating those lies to you we the people well then they go the next step their insurance policy which is even though Lisa Page said there was no evidence of Trump Russia collusion and struck said that\nThere is no there there well then they start immediately strategy leaking again the same Clinton Russian dot CA\nAnd that becomes the basis of the appointment of Robert Mueller and then we go off investigating people's loans happily applications good grief it just as pathetic but they only cared about Trump Russia collusion media ignored that\nThen the media when it comes to judge Kavanaugh and the new Kavanaugh standard which is guilt by accusation all that to only is applied towards Republicans\nBecause I haven't heard Camilla Harris Spartacus or Dick Durbin or you know a Senator Feinstein or any of them ever demand an investigation and FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nThat's fairly recent and we're real evidence real text messages a real tape\nDoctors'

hypocrites they only care about Republican Russia collusion that doesn't exist not Hillary collusion they only care about stopping cabin all but not stopping\nYou know Allison are not stopping the recent allegations based on the cabinet standard we'd be calling for FBI investigations into Corey Spartacus Booker\nOr Bill Clinton himself up we're going to go back forty years\nAnd the rape

individuals organizations or locations here in New York City New Yorkers are safe but everyone all eight point six million residents and the millions of visitors who come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange or out of place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable like a flag down a cop call nine one one or ... toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight\nNew York city safe and as for anything new or someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make\nTowards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\n... joined terrorist taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision but I can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second and on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're saying that today to add up in abundance of caution hotel you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today\nI have a match pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD do each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public reserves safe\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city who make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr mare\nThank you very much commissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who have done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence important that we proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on the media outlets an attack on the prominence of public figures\nOr we're going to make sure there's expanded the president's as long as we needed to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending people who are coming under attack that part of how we protect to the Democratic process\nIs to show the threats like this are not taken lightly so that they expect that presidents and I know that for those who have gone through this in the last few days that the president said they appreciate greatly want to say that uh\nTheir New Yorkers have responded to this situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for it makes me very very proud of all eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation\nA with a real sense of resolve a they're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved\nAh the people of this city or are not being thrown off the game or not having their values undermined or the way of life undermined the workers are standing strong right now and the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear\nA clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred in too much division in the air and in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here\nUh first of all helping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation to share it with law enforcement immediately I'll let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold it back\nAre so many times and I agree with the commissioner of law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough if you have information\nSharing if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police and get a their involvement to address the situation\nJersey of figured out who Menendez is just like in Minnesota people have figured out who Keith Ellison is he down seven\nIt looks like you know when now finding out of the people have figured out who reticent is down in Tennessee and who McCaskill is in Missouri and who's Christine seminar cinema is in a you know for sure I don't have a problem to Americans joined the Taliban\nI why would she get one vote in Arizona after being that crazy\nBut we have a race there in the ... race now with the attorney general the west Virginia Patrick ... bike to over Joe Manchin a lot of people weren't expecting that when you think about it is\nLogical all the success of the west Virginia ... saving coal jobs and energy jobs and all the prosperity is because of Trump's policies\nAnd mentioned didn't even support the tax cuts and frankly my guess is the capital vote was just an election year conversion it'll go right back to supporting Chuck Schumer\nAnd Missouri you've got the Daily Caller reporting that Josh Hawley who's running against Claire McCaskill sharing a photo of a yard sign that have been vandalized with a swastika and his name on the sign is this what it's really come down to we asked you now the Missouri attorney general\nClaire McCaskill also caught on tape saying oh I'm just like Obama I'm just I'm just saying these things to get elected um she doesn't care about raining in or or representing the people of Missouri\nYou know you've got another Daily Caller report\nTalks about non exploding bombs turned up yesterday and today the New York times has no reason it's seemingly to apologize but the Trump assassination fantasy that they published the day before the pipe bomb was discovered the first one\nTimes publishing ... short story about assassinating president Donald Trump on Tuesday one day before potential explosive devices showed up at the addresses of all these political figures New York times are asking novelist to conjure up possible outcomes to Robert Mueller's investigation\nThey don't care of it was only care about Russia collusion as long as it's a Republican elderly care about sexual misconduct or assault if it's a Republican they ignore Ellison Spartacus Clinton\nThey only care about incendiary language when they think it comes from a conservative not their own\nBy the way Charles Grassley is issued a criminal referrals for Abbott naughty and Julie sweat neck member she was the woman that made the accusation oh that almost on a weekend basis they would they would spike the punch bowl and boys would line up in the halls and they would

West Virginia ... congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on\nThe differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good\nAnd we're going to win an election day we just have to keep out working in the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business you know it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened to the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion ... supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate that so that's why the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know

left and liberal for you know who they really are and um uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't hear a whole bunch about a\nRepeal or replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have and by the way pre existing conditions of big lie that's being ...\nAll all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh ember atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people and you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge care you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a vacation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on an absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that I've got a tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every it we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida real little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the sand just for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose

behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's his full time staff are I'm sure that ah he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not just as a project

two years of great economic growth since Donald Trump's been president out of the people of Tennessee feel about the president's policies and and the important vote the boats that you will be casting
