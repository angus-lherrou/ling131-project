Obama next savior of the Democratic party the next anointed one it is dying to find the right person okay what given your best shot at the bottom line is if they really cared about the issue as they said they did\nWell then Cory Booker would be under investigation because those allegations made about an assault this weekend about am\nNever mind what he had already admitted he did on his own\nOn top of Keith Ellison he would've been investigated not one of the these Democrats have called for an investigation\nI don't know if any of its true the person that seems the most credible here is this

the ... and most ugly presidential I in the modern just three of this country I cannot think of one thing though which is ugly and more cruel\nWe've got to do several things than I Am you know adamantly against illegal immigration even half the staff employee illegal immigrants\nCome to west Chester showed is that they can Nassau County stand in the street corners and in the front of the world's if people waiting to get picked up\nThose do yard work in construction work and domestic for you know this is not a problem that the people who are coming into the country are solely responsible for the winter is coming if we didn't put them to work\nMy proposal\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship a number of immigrants added to the labor force every years of magnitude not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly most co workers provide some benefits the economy as a whole it also turns to the press further the wages of blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until\nWe have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair\nIt was suggested I was thinking about coming here legally\nThere will be no repercussions for such a decision\nAnd this could lead to a surge\nIllegal immigration alright amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former speaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm and Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody who disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way\nHillary Clinton would have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump her now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on it alone\nThat he sponsored sorry it's personal point\n[laughter] get that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up uh I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um I don't know of anybody\nIn American history\nWho attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nIs just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact would have said he's going to have on both this year's election and on killing two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what three weeks three and a half weeks but\nOne thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land right we're a nation of laws and\nI don't ... and in the process the people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nShow show now you'll understand\nPsychologically what Abraham Lincoln went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd um the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight as soon as this this was you know you aren't going to choose and he said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great test that President Trump is going to face because\nHe he when he talked about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt you feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning says it has been It's MORNING if if the president is serious\nThat Mexicans only have two choices then you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them and northern Mexico and if you ask yourself this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position to be that that Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they turn back the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them in Sydney powers done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons and that blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states\nThat they're gonna have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know but the reality is I Know by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of it\nPresident Trump talks about the middle

I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in\nAnd I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over I might just because I disagreed vehemently with um I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box\nI have I have a fear and when I say it was ... I'm getting myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I have always said within the man of the ... that's why I say I have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up only me the old me will come out and then if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response will go by but I think they pick and choose their targets does exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it it it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice\nWe ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better I'm so there's a certain discipline David\nLet's see I did with that and but most people don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful in but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nThey're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on\nParalleled economic success fourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever\nI I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display they know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for a better job they can see the orchestra now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this because out of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so do you know they said well we don't like\nThe some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixteen was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him as a message to live in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good for\nWhat we're doing with the conservative movement for\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the all the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this\nDay but if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or education from the Latin is in ... to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left this authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion\nAnd that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort to identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a rat race a sexist massage in this Tacoma ...

the balance of power is going to be made in terms of who's going to control the house look I think we're going to do well in the Senate but you know off year elections are historically what they are and they're tough\nBut I Do think that you have a great chance of holding on to this seat because you've served the people in North Carolina oh\nSo this is a blue moon election first year in North Carolina there is no governor no us center on the ticket I'm at the top of the tickets so you know well that makes mom really proud of the same time uh it's I'm at the top of the ticket and so we got
