Xena phobic Islamophobia homophobic\nYou know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff just when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that while the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm going to tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to keep the progress that we've had\nWant to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the word speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it the worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I Will tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit poll showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan and Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four with the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida\nHi oh Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know you go back in you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican rock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seed difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media and twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they pay the Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong in twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's filibuster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the GOP not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet\nSenate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned it into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but in all four it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou shouldn't do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans pick up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is all white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you a deep let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe G O P claim they similar one point advantage lead in ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nIs burg on Saturday and no one in the media all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous it is ugly it is twisted it is sick it is the famine tore\nAnd frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue for such slander and an libel his comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi\nWho watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeting he's receiving hate mail for saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer\nIt's unbelievable\nAnyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God and a temple and their gun down\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from an identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and pro Trump\nWhile the guy Bowers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue\nWas anti Trump and his run derby or has said the ambassador to Israel as Bebe Netanyahu has said you know they've never heard anyone president ever say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rushed to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi set on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation is why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\nRose tenant friend of this program she was on with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group\nAnd they want to give them any attention and then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful I mean how\nPastors and priests and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald\nTrump wins because Trump should lose a hundred million to one according to Peter Struck even Peter Struck said there's no there there used to pay\nSaid ... just prior to the appointment of smaller they had no evidence of any type of collusion none\nIt's outrageous\nYou know you watch this this vile anti Semitic racist Trump hater murdering a Lebanon innocent people injuring six others\nI mean you see it's basically the face of evil evil exists\nIt exist in society exist all around the world why we need to spend the money we spend on a strong national defense that's why we need to be tough with oh Kim Jong un and the ... Iran\nYou know it's we had the deadliest attack against the Jewish community on American soil in our history\nPresident said no will destroy you if you attack them which was the right answer is no place in this country for evil racist anti Semite none\nAnd I don't think there's been a president in modern history that has demonstrated his support for a number one ally\nIn the middle east and frankly between Great Britain in Israel but this is the closest alliance we have\nAs America founded on Judeo Christian principles it's a personal connection in his own family with his daughter and son in law is grandchildren you know as um you know he's the one that deported the Nazi death camp guard Obama didn't do it could've but he didn't\nIt's been the most pro Israeli president rightly so since Nineteen forty seven moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nHas presidents never had the courage to do it\nIsraeli prime minister or I've often said was the only adult on the world stage finally has a partner that understands the evils and the threats of radical Islam and\nEspecially Iran and the mainstream media Democrats speaking with one voice blame Trump\nBut this horrific attack Dana Milbank writing Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews\nWhat a lie what a slanderous disgusting despicable lie also in the Washington Post an editor writing you know Trump is stoked the fears of those like Bower\nOne columnist the New York times Trump is flirted with the deepest racist the Nazis and it is not gone unnoticed the least of all by them\nBlaming the president now not only is Trump historically since forty eight the most supporter of president\nOf Israel and the Jewish community the monster that committed this evil atrocity in the synagogue a happen to have Trump why because Trump is so close with our friends and allies of Israel\nAnd Bowers posting online is hatred in contempt for Trump because of his support for Israel but yet the mainstream media's coverage that doesn't matter at one you know CNN and\n... you know GQ correspondent saying that the president is worse than ISIS I think you know the fact that at\nOne of the things that ... where they launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rat on radicalization our president has radicalized so many more people and I separated by the president has found more support or as hell has inquiry hateful ideology CNN\nAnd it's unbelievable she says well my comments or ... that's all we've heard all weekend\nAnd then you get fake news president Jeff Zucker lecturing the president on rhetoric and civility this is his network every second minute hour of every day it's anti Trump\nThen that idiot hump they dumped the you know who is basically the you know\nSpokesmen for soccer ... sucker over the weekend as a guest we played some of those yesterday saying oh Hannity's responsible for\nThe violent actions deranged individual when in fact we have on this program we have for the last\nMonth and warning people the rhetoric too hot and they need to calm down because you could see this coming with you know we can't be civil kick them out running women at a restaurant Sarah Sanders Pam Bondi Kristin Nielsen and Mitch McConnell Ted Cruz and his wife\nYou know in uh Boulder thrown through Kevin McCarthy store\nYou know you could see the hostility about all things conservative Republican you\nKnow I call for security and peace and people do take out their differences at the ballot box\nBut that doesn't stop them they're so desperate to get noticed\nSo desperate to help their democratic allies and friends when one week from today it's pathetic\nFrankly it's slander and then of itself now we've got to get to the\nPoint in this country of huge gets slander you ought to be able to sue and have a chance to win or you have to prove the absence of malice\nWell how about an absence of research because if they ever listened to watch they seem very different Sean Hannity than the caricature that they paint\nWhen do you notice sewers Ferris to us in the news media I could not believe I was on the front cover of the national Enquirer it's on stands all over the

would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida and I'd love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is that a tight race\nLet's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that than it legal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in so happy and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby a buddy of Andrew saying really appreciate the mayor coming through why\nWasn't any arrests that isn't that buying influence and corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York jog get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know\nOh in addition to that thousand dollar ticket that the agent gave the Gillum the FBI agent also under rode a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically covering your tracks CYA so I don't mean to say that report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas or one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day of poses having\nOur embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when a Israel fought back against the Moffett path and may ah Gillum blamed Israel you know they just use those attack as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief hindrance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida or they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice and that the police needs to be the funded they pay they say the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialist principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that just who he is he believes in what they're doing is endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's please them proud to a snake food\nTo dream defender activists during a thirty days sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical groups\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement there in the free enterprise there in the military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... in the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it really up in the arrangements have millions and millions of ... that he thinks it's appropriate for governments to take away health benefits that people are burned and to force them to be on this single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states\nThey're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that went on governor buddy Andrew has his way he'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish men a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody for criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nAlso support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background that looks like almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him in this great candidate\nUm they do not like the scrutinize his record or the fact that those documents dad release after he lied and the debate last Sunday or the media is kind of had to cover that but\nAt the end of the day he has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just one Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle um uh but the pan handle so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own\nAnd they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people from\nThe panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want a vote in this election but this Florida is their home\nThey're doing a lot ah everything from mobile voting sites to accommodations for absentee ballot you know the bad news as you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by\nThe weekend a which we weren't sure could happen that quickly um and I know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so are they are resilient people are in the Panama City area um and I know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm a ... the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado would wiped it out\nYeah lugging I mean it it's going to take time obviously with me coming in as governor I'm gonna have to deal with it and take off where request off\nI Will say though um had that gone forty miles west of the population would have been much bigger\nI'm sure there is damage and its extensive damage but I think in damage in a relatively limited area is there's a couple area that got hit pretty good so we know what we got to do and I think we'll be able to go in and do what we are the president has committed to doing any repairs necessary for ten do air force

there's been an influx by the way uh he's been in office by the way since ... twenty Fifteen running against the Democratic challenger Katie Hill\nAnd a ton of money now we see millions and millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg who is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California\nAnd why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job with the people that state anyway he joins us now congressman how are you\nShone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ... old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat a Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of these\nAre really being targeted at a tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today uh how much money is being thrown at against you and towards your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a hot sauce and said New York city because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here\nI think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district or that's not something I Want it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nAnd what do you think the goals are well let's let the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people they use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races are obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\nI think that's probably the reason but he's also look at it districts that he thinks he can uh you can do some ... uh this is this has been a held by Republicans for very long time and we're going to win the seat\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's got to a saturation point now where people are just so upset\nI think people get wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their at their bills and there are other male um and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox\nI mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize\nThat if you don't want Nancy Pelosi speaker if you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do in your power at the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house that's the best case scenario one is a split decision\nThey gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker the worst case scenario it's Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen\nRight now the ... they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends\nWhether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or we're going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment\nWe're going to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats\nOr we're going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like you're the same people that ruined the health care system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote\nAnd if you understand the vote for any House Democrats vote for ... below sea any Democratic Senate vote as a boat for sure that we should have a pretty good night a week from now\nBut the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide\nAnyway I um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a
