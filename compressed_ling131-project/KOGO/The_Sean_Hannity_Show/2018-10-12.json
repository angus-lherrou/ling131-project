Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handled Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing\nThe president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it hurt don't told Trump to bring these guys and I should've known I should've known Geraldo told Trump to get\nKanye West in there and Joe Brown and tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you don't ... her rental did bring up a or something I forgot it was\nKanye West to tone George W. Bush\nThat\nHe didn't think he cared about black people because Hurricane Katrina boy that remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the left was out there saying that Bush wanted\nBlacks in Louisiana New Orleans to be hurt so that they would leave and they go to Texas or someplace to lessen the strength of the Democratic party in Louisiana they were out there saying that the Bush also a was able to steer the hurricane and that\nBush was responsible for the Lebanese being weak because he didn't hold people accountable when they didn't spend the money to shore them up\nBut it was Kanye West so can you handle all kinds of crab back then it two thousand five rip it in divorce they loved him but the love was sleeping obviously be right back\nTo Russia Mickey I we were\nListening to Rush Limbaugh on news radio six hundred\nWhen my cardiologist told me I needed to take a stat rotten to lower my cholesterol he also told me that it can lower my natural levels of co Q. ten [noise] he told me to take ... it has the number one cardiologist recommended form of co Q. ten a very important nutrient\nFor healthy heart and healthy blood pressure went along with three times better absorption\nAs the number one cardiologist recommended form of cookie tend to know them better co Q. ten\nTo nine ten nine central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady the interview can women in the me too movement call you a supporter no question this is off limits you're not the first first lady to have to deal with her husband's alleged infidel and he's just put a strain on your marriage\nTonight what will the lawyer Trump say let's talk about the jacket this\nWhy did you wear being ...

Ninety four point five and Panama City and everybody there and we'll be back on Monday you have a great weekend Fox adios [noise]\nHam why I have to go live\nI think that that should be basic and fundamental for anybody\nThe issue of incivility is now back in the forefront even more I mean it shouldn't surprise anybody\nUm and by the way what is really happening what a play ... James O'Keefe is going to join us and a Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there him and his campaign in his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people\nThe tendency but the very purpose of getting elected and they say it's not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play a few later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing\nThat people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe and the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh wait do we get to the tape on cinema today\nOr you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington\nBut go when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump they're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time\nBecause that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nDidn't never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs so never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and well they tell him well you know it's costing us\nYou know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... ... because of that regulation\nWell the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like why do we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of ballast marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties there's like there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnd we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen\nAnd then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's imprisoned that or like car with that attitude\nThat deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been hearing the Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows in the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary I our our human\nOur human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs making with things in America and creating jobs in America you know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed\nAnd we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd why as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that it's downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious vile thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't read flat folks\nAren't that ten praying Kanye West and the racial draft now the sudden ... hats and he's an attention more like the president have all of a sudden now that the the model folks person he's he's the token negro of the of the Trump administration's\nMiss wasn't embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you had there and man has clearly not okay to president who's willing to point that\nWas a combination of famous consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health on a question of other calling him I felt very point and to me\nThat was something very fragile valid and sad about tiny playing on the phone and France like type ... outside I think for their own piling up somewhere picture of a ... I mean [laughter] cannot it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television at\nThat but I think we're all a thoughtful play by play and political and now has not seen as that was her fault on our rights\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually full bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\nThis was white supremacy by ... of course I'm a black mouth is moving with white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices and yet how black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of it and see black sentiments that have been shown shack\nNews radio six hungry go go live local breaking\nHurricane Michael now to Thirteen um jak Ronan the cocoa news for more than a million people are still without power at one point four million across six states in the cells still without power after this morning as recovery efforts continue\nWe hope to have a hundred percent of the initial search and rescue operation down in Florida Today as well as Georgia\nAdministrator Brock Long hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle Wednesday's a category for store when speech just two miles per hour shy of a category five hurricane they send you one in her room mates who were raped by a man's cause to be released\nThe county here today here in courts pleading with the judge to keep him in a state hospital Alvin re corals known as the Boulder than most rapists was convicted Nineteen eighty nine\nSeveral salts rape cases but he was paroled and spent the last five years in a state hospital you can be released today the ... hot springs was victims are in court testifying\nI'm more worried for what he could give it to the future of\nExpect to be released and closely monitored the judge said on the final decision on the appeal and the groups behind measured gee the SJSU west planning to member ballots promoting their support from groups like the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society\nSaying if they win and twenty five days ... will go through the full state of California environmental review process or genes yes\nYes us plan will go through that process and so this was a coalition of environmental advocates that want to do the best for San Diego and the best friend is San Diego river park and the San Diego river\nOr finger the groups supporting measured Jeter humid today along the river is yes you West is competing against the soccer city planned permission belly that's known as ... ... e\nDowntown San Diego is Seventy three degrees um jak wrote an extra one o'clock thinking at the same form San Diego's breaking news station radio six hundred Coco\nFrom near San Diego hundreds healers traffic center very tough drive on the south fired from ... let's Costa just before the exit there was a crash and the left him lane miles of very tight traffic there in the north bound sites also\nBusy from leukemia traffic sponsored by ... corporate surface level strictly there's an extra ...\nThe radio [noise] twenty five 'til the what what do you why why do you ensure that all interrupt twenty five to the top of the hour we'll you about that you were going to interrupt me anyway I might as well get it out of the way\nI mean you know you're enjoying thing twenty five to the top of the hour I never want to interrupt that\nWon't want to make sure people do that at the bottom of the hour and went up to the top of the hour so that they can keep track of time in some sense if they have a phone or watch I don't wear watches\nHeaven help us if we didn't have any for that I don't like any jewelry at all I like nothing anything on me I'm aware that's why you're never all you want to know\nWhy 'cause I I the many of my friends they're like into like sports cars and that watches and all that stuff is means nothing to me\nI have a phone my time is on my phone I look one time I look at my phone\nActually really like watching for men [noise] we do you do I do I think it's very nice\nMy father war time mix he bought it at the local drugstore that's why the war\nWas ...\nThey usually had no the the one that was like um silver or goldie change colors every once in a while\nWell keeping with silver and gold nothing's precious in rare I just wanted to give it a little shout out to our new person highly 'cause you know I just feel like she's just doing such\nA huge amount of one day I'm up the one that you ignore the other death at your at her and her ... birthday wishes to everybody else on the team the person that I stuck up for that you ignored\nDying now it's really horrible that I did not wish her birthday when it was on her birthday I don't know what I was\nThinking that day I don't know what you're thinking that\nDay so I just wanted to to make amends and just let America know how the ...

all the states is a very tight race Heller is up by two\nOut in Arizona make Sally believe it or not is now up by six this was before the release of these tapes which I Believe is definitely going to

of Senate races\nThat are really winnable in this atmosphere where we just watched the Senate all stand in line but for Joe Manchin and follow Chuck Schumer is lead\nAnd remember if you have that happening and that many states you're not going to get a blue wave in the house\nAnd they're the same voters of the same people and and the tide is not there but but there's something else or you just said that I think's really important and again I'm I'm thinking out loud with you so you trigger the reporting you're doing has triggered this in my own thinking I think our folks so to start shifting towards humor\n[laughter] I I really mean is I think you could take\nYou know I mean here I Am I'm I'm throwing is hard to punch is like yeah I'm I'm fighting as hard as I Know how to fight and then you had any just what your foot off the gas and tell a joke\nYou know no no no I Want you to put your foot on the gas even more but remember as Reagan often proved sometimes humor is more devastating that anger\nHe's right now so for example in quite a ... I I really think marshes editorial it'll be ... it's okay well I understand you're a liberal well understand you're going to vote for humor but don't don't be ashamed of it it's All right\nFor it you really are and and again I think I think it's just something that I learned this in part\nFrom from the great coverage oh John F.

lying to get boats\nCaught red handed I'm I Know how you work James O'Keefe I have I my known you know over a decade and I'm just assuming that there's probably part two three four and five coming and what are you got\nWell there there's a there's a big the biggest congressional elections of our lifetime and\nAnd in in the past we've done part of a particular state now this time we've got multiple states\nI'm four years ago we did for these and we've got so many and this is a problem Sean that in all the swing states we have another one coming out early next week it's similar problem and use red state Democrats\nHaving to lie to the voters to get elected it it it is and every single\nDo you want to give us a hint what state is is there is one of is it either North Dakota Indiana and Missouri is Arizona Florida\nOne of those it's one of the ones you just mentioned and every happening editor on tape and and listening to Shaun\nOh they have their senator on tape that means it's not Arizona let me go booze [laughter] so it could be in and that could be Heidi Heitkamp Joe Donnelly it could be on western Montana and\nAnd that's before the release of the tape that we showed last night of cinema in twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona that she wants to vote for her crazy I don't think that's going to go over well nor do I think it's going to go over well that she invited this\nThis radical attorney to Arizona State university ... or ... university a lawyer convicted of aiding and abetting an Islamic terror organization and its leader\nThe lawyer and question represented someone who was one sentence to life in prison\nA sentence for in the nineties for blowing up a plotting to blow up the UN and an FBI building so I think a cinemas going to see a dramatic drop in the polls there and I think things will look up for Martha ... he was a rock star a person that has served her country with incredible distinction\nUm and here to go through all these latest numbers and what it means and whether or not to this is gonna be the blue wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over\nRedux a we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shown is with us welcome both the back to the program\nThank you thank you I don't think there's any doubt the cabinet overreach\nAnd the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence has now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and cinema in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies\nAnd when you have thirty two house seats really going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I ... I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stopped but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing it about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing and how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I don't know also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have pulled their because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your paltry to raise taxes take what you've got take away the jobs take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans don't want to go back to that I mean we have holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country so these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house\nBut I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations an impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively of interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they're really to reality is there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast\nAnd the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I was kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of New York and I've\nNoticed which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state\nDid you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it so he actually\nSaid those conservative\nYou know that their problems not me it's not just themselves are streaming\nMay try that there are actually are conservatives who says he knows that it's not a\nSimple number one tons within a rifle me\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment\nUh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor governor that you love and vote for one's me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\n... the ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNow I I I think look you're still the kid from Franklin square you're still you're still in hand with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because we New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way Doug folding out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it oh yeah yeah I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid or because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make should get through Mayor Bloomberg or get or a Democrat primary these days because they're so radical and that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important in terms in our lifetime because\nYou really have a clear choice for a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you\nDo oh I Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal rates is absolutely don't she should go period\nStyle absolutely and and does point about in previous times or have been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again once the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time what should it be it should be better stop Nancy Pelosi's from getting\nWell I think it's got to do that or not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if\nYou believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan and the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh ... all of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\n... for music and re\nDownload the free I hard radio ... today besides running on endless investigation and impeachment and wanting their crumbs back\nAnd wanting to keep Obamacare and wanting to eliminate ice and open borders [noise] can you name one policy that Democrats are running on that would help the American people Doug ...\nMake sure that the health care is covered for those with\nPreexisting by the way Donald Trump is saying the same thing\nIt's just the Republican Party has not been a sensitive to the issue as the Democrats but I I got another issue Charlotte\nThey're all saying oh hold on to what Obamacare So\nWell come my way of thinking what they should say is no ... no impeachment of cabin or no impeachment of Trump just work on issues like a compromise on immigration compromise on healthcare and continue your choice and education\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which they never will because they're not a moderate party that would absolutely pretty much wrap it up for the house in my opinion\nI agree Sean where I'm the same page John do I have your support to work with Sean when we find a state or nation for him to run and for the highest\nCould operate we can do not got a yes or no he could run out I got to win\nOr not you know like your ... your way by the way we're checking out your high school yearbook\nRight now [laughter] I've never looked at it as I Know freaking idea what's in there and [laughter] my God\nI Know it you're not exactly run for the Supreme Court but if if no check
