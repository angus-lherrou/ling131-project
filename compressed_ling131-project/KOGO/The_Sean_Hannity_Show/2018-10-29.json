tide here if we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house\nReal clear politics average has the Democrats at two o five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature for our organization is ignore the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the\n... or everybody me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nCancer and a a less habit

there are many factors I think Kavanaugh is playing a part in this I think the Democrats none of them have spoken at all about the caravan there's sounds has been definite you know and then they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and Xena phobic it no it just means we believe in the rule of law\nIt was suggested that I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision\nAnd this could lead to a surge\nIllegal immigration these are students teachers they're doctors or lawyers [noise]\nThey're Americans in every way but on pay for those who fed or the country illegally and those were telling them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states fund detected\nUndocumented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully does become immigrants\nReal reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earn citizenship\nAll right no news roundup information overload our eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nUh a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that let people got to the border not download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole\nColumn me up with my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the ... the actually that's a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this ... folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution making ... presidents for life in bed with the Venezuelans\nAnd lay out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos pictures from the mark\nSo again no great great mystery this is\nWork of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad in our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of\nAssociating this with which anti immigrant sentiment or the you know phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with us ... does not have anything to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks don't want to control the border why is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting status if that's the principal\nWhen I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border be it at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence\nAnd that our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want it almost\nSue me Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here are coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on a ... percent we don't want to be hurt and also it has undoubtedly true\nThat most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S ... probably been lied to the gun\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call\nWest Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results\nOn the morning after the night before and it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house\nAnd that's going to be the best case scenario or it's gonna be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house or it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go vote for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all into get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and ... make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses but is Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman [noise]\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number [noise]\nNews radio six hungry go go live local bring\nA lot of

actually if you look at real clear politics they have they ever narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point is actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats and the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if\nWe win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want

campaigning hard every single day meeting every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue is to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach Trump but don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say where\nAnd for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like you know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back beyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose
