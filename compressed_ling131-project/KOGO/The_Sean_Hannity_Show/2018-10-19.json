or rock as a rock star it can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA you try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans I think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen I I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and\nGet an update uh apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what are the Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using in this I Can't even believe this district you know these drones that they fly with cameras above\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly droves with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their ... and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nAt so evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful now the president\nWell he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh they wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex where Scott has killed himself and on such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I maybe it doesn't have the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of a lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked that talk a good game and just are lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that is why project very tossed catching Brett ascent on tape\nAnd his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cow but he's not going to support cabinet he's not going to\nBe [laughter]\nI Can't even
