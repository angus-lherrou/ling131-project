we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together about protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans\nTo turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from Iraq\nTo re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties\nTo this one guy and uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day you know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but you know remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve\n... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field and nearly killed Steve Scully so the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through all the time was far worse than was reported and people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy\nBroke into the White House when Obama was president\nAnd as it came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said\nMr Speaker is you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot\nOn fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Adams lawn somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nWhich I had and he says had a direct language man we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative jets yeah which is not like the others\nRight why Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessing deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... or the Robert De Niro is calling the president of devil in a devil worshippers effect you know\nA piece of playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the dishes and see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ... so you're measuring\nLenient lame ing me because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly [noise] stupid he's a punk\nHis dog he's a big he's a con artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald Trump [noise]\n\nThank you Sean\nHi this is John on traffic of fire fighting Iraq\nThe entertainment industry boy for rotating\nThousand personal thing\nFrom the San Diego county credit

next real time traffic update is at twelve thirty and Cox\n\nZero long eight hundred ... you're not going to get this isn't the double standard in the media you get conservatives who say you can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nBecause one of his ... supporters went up there and shot somebody but it's there there is an obsession to always blame conservatives for the actions of some of these cases and that appears to be the media talking point three hour for the day here\nUm you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders and he shot up Republicans on a ball field and Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar\nThey've gone deep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they're in love with the Clintons there nobody vets Keith Ellison or Cory Booker it's always hypocrisy [noise]\nYou know you look at the hearing ... who's been warning that horrible things are going to happen if the rhetoric doesn't come down as the meat of the most part CNN and these other networks have been silent when Republicans are confronted everywhere [noise]\n\nNews radio

Kevin McCarthy is a office window you know let's\nGo out there and and we're going to get in their faces and we're going to confront people and create crowds and we've got to tell them you're not wanted anywhere anymore you know the amazing\nThing just how dead silent the news media has been I don't have a lot of time that I'm going to waste here yet on John Avalon or whatever his name is over at fake news CNN well deniro is not like the others why Robert De Niro about what I found is Sean Hannity will do what do we just heard\nDe Niro and what the narrow was saying about the president our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over and fake news CNN any at all\nThey see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter ... and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October Fifteen that old segment blasting deniro\nOut in the wilderness or the shooter esteem squeezed blaming Bernie Sanders\nTo suggest any way that honest a vigorous debate and criticism\nIs the motivating force behind one fringe violent individual let me tell you what that is that is intellectual laziness and it's cheap attempt frankly to capitalize off a dangerous and serious incident\nEspecially in light of the fact while others on TV have been utterly silent their silence is deafening I've been to one saying something horrible is going to happen it needs to stop\nYou know do you face CNN sucks or CNN is fake news that is not a cry or an ad vacation of violence in any way shape or form it's a feeling people have when they see a few abusive link biased news coverage\nIf you're American with us sold is should transcend politics\nI deplore all violence of any kind but legitimate fair criticism of me that's fair game media criticism is fair game\nCalling out networks that have political agendas that's fair game when network spend every second minute and our of the day Haiti on Donald Trump Donald Trump cured cancer they still hate him well I'm allowed to call that out that's not hate if there's any hate their their hatred of the president that they can't seem to get over\nYou know the bottom line is you're watching people trying to make an attempt to exploit and politicize the actions of one unhinged lunatic and conflated with fair and wanted criticism\nAnd that for them as they're putting politics above all else and that's wrong for the country and anybody that has intimidated into stopping what they do because of this predictable attack I put it all up on Hannity dot com\nAnd it's called the left new low Hannity slams the media's total failure to report liberal calls for violence yeah we've got it all chronicled with all we we put the tape and everything you need to one place\nAnd we're going to tweet that we're going to send that out to everybody where Lebanon days away from election day and there's a lot at stake\nRight now Republicans you know what they're behind I think in Florida that means Rick Scott's behind that means the fantasy is behind there's a lot at stake Florida goes to Gillum in terms of governing the state of Florida it will be a disaster that's my prediction\nIt doesn't help that many have been displaced in the panhandle a very conservative part of Florida and I hope those people are able to get back and unable to vote before the election but I can tell you Marsha Blackburn can and should win in Tennessee if everybody goes out and vote\nAnd I think the Missouri can be flipped easily now that we know that Claire McCaskill just like Phil Bredesen in Tennessee has been lying through AT T about who she really is she's talking about you know crazy Democrats well she votes left on everything so I guess she's counting herself in that group\nI Know Dean Heller can win in Nevada and I certainly believe Martha ... can beat the radical extremists Christian seminar cinema\nI think Jon Tester can be beaten to although he's a little bit up in the polls right now in Montana Heidi Heitkamp should lose in North Dakota Joe Donnelly if people don't split the ticket and vote libertarian he would lose easily to Brown in Indiana that would be another pick up\nThat was for as far as the four hundred and thirty five members of Congress you know we're going to go over some of the important race it believe it or not there in states like California Dana Rohrabacher\nYou know people like Darrell ISIS old seat you know a Duncan Hunter seat is in jeopardy got to get him back in Congress\nAnd all the tricks that they've been playing out in Southern California and you got seats will talk to Claudia Tenney in New York seats in New Jersey seats in Illinois are at stake Minnesota Michigan Wisconsin\nYou know every all four hundred and thirty five that means everybody hearing my voice right now\nYou need to get out and vote eleven days or you'll get Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer as the Senate majority leader\nIt's going to stop the progress we've made that we can have a full victory and hold on to the house and Senate and pick up seats in the Senate you can have a split decision where maybe we pick up seats in the Senate lose the house and then you gotta have a total failure disaster debacle if you don't vote\nBut again that's up to you All right eight
