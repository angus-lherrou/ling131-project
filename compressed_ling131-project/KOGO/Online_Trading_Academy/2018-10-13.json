{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "Out of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior mayor told them\nElle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps establish who's telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern I\nI'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior when Kavanaugh a pattern\nOf being you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be from Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it\nYou know we needed to show a pattern here's here's Ken and Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia or not only are you all rush though but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best that in part gas\nOr should have the ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a\nWith Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quoted came across years ago and maybe even you set it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility for Barbara ... and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of who were either trending towards civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just\nOutright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party and grow what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy what worries me then\nI think it was um before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what ... what not when what why are they what were they like when the Democrats weren't a Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic um issue was a labor laws and um when\nYou know what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century in the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on the militants and violent socialism to achieve their means\nMy point they're not\nThat different there just masking

sorry about that hit us up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track ... consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the markets are going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bombs but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the markets are the Martin he's going somewhere either go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond short gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is\nIs that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing last February Goldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market to imagine that we had a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up\nIt's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're gonna go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ally ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we\nThere's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out right I just dated myself big over there but it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have\nThat stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions they say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to is up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nAnd it it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think is a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area that has the classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the market\nUnderstand how the market works I understand what the risks are involved with a lot of different investments out there and early ... capital capitalize on the upside down and have their

structure development and instructor at training academy really shut ... consistent returns to the market [noise] one of my favorite topic low talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had\nSome success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently ugly make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down\nAnd also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow and in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in maybe\nYour first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even caught maybe that that supplemental side that you're talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income is a great\nRight you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the ...\nHad I mean what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation may people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace

trading\nEconomy really shed some light\nOn multiple streams of income we talked a little bit about passive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but\nBut even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh well you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill it just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying now and unfortunately it ends up being that same the same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death but really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this\nJust as seriously we work too hard for this money to have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading and they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over voter some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start\nCreating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement right now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student\nEmailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door\nReally nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in direct lately and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is what I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last\nSo we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nYou you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups in the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call 'em crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at them how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that yet about fifty percent\nDrums Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early two thousand fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father about ah we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and\nThey lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total right that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that", "show_name": "Online Trading Academy", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "13"}
