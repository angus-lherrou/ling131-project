...\n[noise] uh\nIf you want to go back to the twenty Fifth Amendment it must be that you don't have anything else seems like the twenty fifth amendments always fall back when\nAll of a sudden the frog tries a couple of times to jump\nBut it's the lead even when you take the little way the frogs still not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else we start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work because then all of a sudden you're this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that kept that you've been believing your whole life has gone away\nAnd that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle when reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets\nSo great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it as think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you'll eventually get there where why would you want to do that people do that everyday Ryan with their trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about with the frog because\n'cause it you know I was teaching a class last night and I have another session with with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting it's had on the box and you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it is that feeling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole oh I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh we do start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we were like oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head it's we stop even trying you know a while ago they are you know ... years and years ago they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a vis the about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even an Olympic on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back straight\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we end up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we end up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started we've got a stack

markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you'll spend about a week or so since we had the big drop\nIn the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate any given generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling\nIf you do know how to make money as the marks for going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined and so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crash there's a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they're looked at as a\nA a not so they looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals do who look at a down market as a bad thing\nNow these individuals that were turning themselves in from millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's kind of situation our income in retirement accounts or in\nIf we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways and if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth

goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we wanted to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had a big ops we've had big downs\nAnd so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes via social media\nAnd a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire or just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it so it's kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day\nWell the simple thing I Would share with our audiences\nThe cavalry ain't come and there's nobody who's going to protect your capital better than you can right now in the way to do that with education\nI mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market imagine your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is this is the first generation right now that has been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThinking about a prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four O. one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told that have been doing this pretty pretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I want everyone to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at all time highs\nNot when the market was low swim imagine when there is another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement a lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize\nFor their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nAlways buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and\nThat was one of the topics were ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on pay and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so\nIf we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible for us to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same rate it it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this\nWhole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than be invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that ah when I first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share it are there but it was just kind of funny ... you would say you can't let their stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is\nIf you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially invest the end of this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and and honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my account except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares\nThere's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account the replaces somebody who is closing their retirements there this perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but\nHow much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Online Trading Academy",
