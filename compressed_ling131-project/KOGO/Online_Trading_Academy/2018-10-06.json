I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again\nA great to have your back\nYeah it's great to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN or a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo kind of white ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant Katherine my Ken and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class at all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught and heard\nOn the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions and so they could have unlimited sex\nYou did you\nEver um ah you're right sex without consequences it but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run to hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine\nIf not better I by the way here's than it does ... you're also random it's not all\nWomen but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include all women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think I Am from your young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every movie and make get notarized after the dates\nYou are listening to Rush Limbaugh ... voice on the right time but I

to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nLarry as we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the bullish biased that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe you could take that into it into a ... expand on that WIPP for our listeners and even even anything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really construction things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right in the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around and some education the problem is a very costly lesson why would you want to spend all that time energy and money when you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shorting the markets and so I Want to use this analogy hurt me use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said to you well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go and drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so to the markets you can trade when the markets are going up\nYou can trade when the market's going down and what most people have learned by coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process the system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's coach ... somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYou when you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trading invest as well\nIt doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to do that starting right now right\nRather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times we tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approached the markets and and and when I talk to people is very normally that did they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income with the skill has to come first and\nIt's the the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody as successful or not it's just like I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight and that that's not going to get you there you have you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane of across the country that's a\nThat's a whole different conversation and we would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation\nBut unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit kit is packed with

O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do\nYou've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days and five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work\nAnd then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules so a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what\nThey're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\n...

just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and half instructor it on my training me really shed\nSome light on income over ... we talked a lot about multiple streams of income we talked about different types of income\nPassive income active income a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on past versus versus active\nIncome and and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow in and that income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment talking to a little bit about the retirement accounts\nAnd so one of the things as maybe missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more a more generating more income well don't worry we're going to be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation\nWhether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot via social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRight we've got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics because I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ditch one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about the urgency because right now historically statistically the markets and the correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier in the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first thing we got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade and mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world the Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss just set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people in senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes will right now you should be thinking about especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira or four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you would have been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover well this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThan we ever see that index of been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this four one K. will become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nYeah and the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down\nIt's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low opera opportunity right can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the marks or going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for uh\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every payday the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks\nMutual funds there for one case bathroom there are a speeds through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is\nThat's ... that's the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks well it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing or financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight they call it dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down and they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging will be very powerful strategy but\nWhen you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer as the customer we have to understand", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Online Trading Academy", "city":
