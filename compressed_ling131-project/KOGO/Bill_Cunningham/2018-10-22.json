F. C. K. dot org and reach out to Molina\nHas made an Enron this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do\nAnd the F. word all these things are shouted against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn to offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor aboard the go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way and the Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\nThe media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth America and Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change that takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico to him and other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled they have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who not been heard yet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats as extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here legally you're going to take and right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to herring that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes ... New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders the rapes et cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the ... most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy\nRight now with Trump is our leader\nEverything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip it was an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers are not just the ... they're the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work and we put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe\nBecause according to CNN this is the issue of unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan to vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have\nThe opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press says these we take in legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together\nWe already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will never happen\nThis is fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens\nThe country we live and will cease to exist do we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go\n... or the bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that the most violent places on earth is sending its largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or a group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have this benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nIn American elsewhere so why is the death of a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news\nBecause the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there is those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that and I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist some alley indirectly cause the death of Jamal could show geek in Turkey who believes is crap\nIt's unbelievable oh let's continue on\nThe line becomes available to never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing\nIs tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivized by the mainstream media and the fact that Jamal could show gate if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage adage that that was should not have died Saudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there seven hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year\nGive me the name and your mind thing give me the name of one cup right now I bet you can't because the media doesn't cover it you mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us than a brave police officer who gave his life is that what\nCNN believes the answer is yes they want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I have no idea they must have nothing else to talk about\nPost continue what we do is go right to the [noise]\nOne becomes available you know the routine built hunting emigrate America\nLive with you every Sunday [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nFox News ...

working on this caravan with a lot of other Democrats across the country [noise]\nAnd he's probably going to be down at the border in a week or so or trying to get over a hundred thousand of the poor you know by the time spring ...\nThan Trump has already said he's not used in the reserves and he's a real army and I think the planners they weren't really like another ... ... ... ... hours or [laughter] or from the border\nI immigrants are being told oh don't worry [laughter] ... like stormed the Mexican border a few days ago mecca would put in a token effort to hold them better twenty four hour ensure [laughter] whoa us and share it with Mexico because Trump has got a very good Mexico I read all these people on our border\nThe troops are going to be there they got to be colder stormed the truth\nI think there's got to be a lot of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there they're\nOh it's for immediate immediate here this is all court\nOffend them and that's why you're from a Dick Blumenthal he used a war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty I does this play well with residents to Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking\nThis was playing horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio\nWe don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals comic most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people in the state because of the high taxes I think the person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant tens of thousands of other

hardly see the cameras all all the\nTime trying to keep the eagle illegal immigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember remember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and get caught you're sent back immediately\nBecause of the law if you're from Central America and you say the magical words I'm a refugee and I want to hearing\nYou get in line with a couple of million others and you never ever hearing venue released back into American emotion can be held his fourteen days there's not we're not scaled have handled this invasion from most violent places on earth Central America we're not scaled or doing\nContinue with added no Las Vegas Nevada and they add welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI or us national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current current boys or that or whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should\nBut who's doing it also how can a bomb a drone American citizens like this hour we eat guy kill and blow 'em up you know trial no jury electrocution and then the media doesn't saying you know at the beginning of march later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and and it's because you know you could shoot him in in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club against Trump they'll do it\nBut ... out of whack he's being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone a cop that are killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact that ... that kind of behavior in that part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists and then I hear about the show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do\nAnd why why did like more valuable than a cubs life\nMPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayers is the same I end up look at the head of the past ... who's back to stand in the oil as political off on July ... portion of Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed a bass their supply Afghanistan\nPlus ... says African Business conference that Obama held route fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and and\nThe are

work what needs to happen is the federal law needs to be changed with the cooperation of the Democratic party that says when you arrived here illegally you're mainly sent back to your country of origin without a hearing\nThat's it no due process because you're not an American\nThe Democrats tend Democrats in the Senate will not allow that to happen they will not allow that change Trump wanted to get the so called dreamers might be twenty million dreamers don't know how many citizenship on the path to in exchange for the border wall to stop it but it can put a cork in a bottle\nBut

one world government isn't going to burgers or the child or or whoever\nYou know on that point in about an hour and twenty minutes someone to call Peter Wallison he's written a book about the bureaucracy the so called deep state held\nThat continues that continues today three thousand new rules and regulations a year hundreds every month it never stops is going on right now Trump's trying to stop it he's going to make the made the point of his book that I read\nThat that it cannot be stopped that there's a deep state in Washington that will continue even assuming Trump is there for eight years it will not be stopped that's his point he might run agree\nBut I Would agree with that completely and I I Want to tell you you know the people that road again governor governor I mean ...

have such a stranglehold on the black community for no reason I ... if we can if you will get over that if if we can because like for example to do is they had a horrible historic event they watched that the struggle to Japanese into account the ... the U.S some reason [noise]\nI think it's because I'm an immigrant so it's not exactly something that it was in court trade and that's what I mean if you go through the public schools I went to ... ... the Hitler they never talk about a hundred million item to comment lives will so that history just bandages\nAnd and and I think education is the key I definitely do\n... we got to go but I Would just stay alert stay alive keep preaching the faith in Connecticut it's one of the parts of the country that badly needs the shot of capitalism and conservatism the worst run states\nIn America are controlled by the Democratic party and the best run states in America are controlled by the Republican Party but thanks for your call let's continue with more I'm going to put a call in or to Corey Lewandowski here in about five minutes see was the campaign manager for Donald Trump for like a year and a half\nAnd I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight look stimuli all hell breaks loose and ABC and NBC and not CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks and two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress and I said oh contrary Ramon forever I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges here's performed magnificently and all three areas\nAnd and I think this is the October surprise that will sink the Democratic party come or the next sixteen days let's continue with more of a line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up in about five minutes we'll be Corey Lewandowski top of the next hour we have Kevin Jackson near the blacks here\nTo talk about why he was let go by Fox and the impact in the black community of illegal immigration that at the bottom of the last hour we're going to have on a report from Peter Wallison who's written a book about the deep state the fourth branch of government\nWhich is the bureaucracy those continuous more built Cunningham the great American\n[noise]\n\nCalm\nNews ... Stevens the Saudi Government acknowledging the death of journalists ... show give the Saudi consulate in Turkey but insisting\nNot monarchy [noise] we have a check [laughter] the individual [laughter] so he obviously this mistake made components in the same type of government\nSaudi foreign minister ... during an exclusive interview Sunday with Fox has read bears some good news at the gas we have\nA nickel decline in the average price of regular grade at ... to Ninety two but in fact there might be a little more to come could oil prices have dropped and refiners are passing through these dropped to enter the wholesale gasoline Marquette\nEndless truly be lumber publishes the Lindbergh survey this is Fox News\nNews radio six hundred cocoa [noise]\nCorey Lewandowski welcome again to the bill Cunningham so Corey how are you I'm doing great bill how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like\nHundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I sit on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump but now President Trump\nHe's truly cares about other people he's extremely\nUh magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media you know they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet but the truth is he's exceptionally\nGracious I've seen in so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center bows out well Brent Brazil one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative\nThe media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough to good they only report\nThe bad in this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time\nIn our nation's history it conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump didn't interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty\nFive times during that interview had to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him the credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they're no longer in the business of reporting the news and they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana friend it as mobs versus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh all\nAlong about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck into side with tens\nI look at how you're confronted in airports and restaurant mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose them there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kicked in the head\nOf the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after\nMembers of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders was secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence antifa is so out of control and go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better\nThis president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper then I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike Melania Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt would be front page news for a week on and that ... the the country artist would have had his life\nProbably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back and just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky\nAnd they asked her I mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult he was the president of the United states\nLeader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production and about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the Senate Republicans gained four or five seats are increasing the majority and in the house I'm going to say that it's a bold prediction the Republicans are going to hang on by two or three seats to retain the majority and keep the Trump Pence agenda moving forward\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski Trump

disaster over a lie and you're right about that but I think the reason that those women didn't do it was and we didn't get too much introspection end of this but if you look at Christine Blasey Ford for life I bet you we find out\nThat you know there's a history of her\nThat nobody wants to discuss and that's why she's linked the way\nYou know when once it was done oh no I'm not going to put the

congressional gangs that went after him including Chuck Schumer and for the record gang for me and not just the ... a girl it's a guy to and Chuck Schumer the gang because he's a guy who was complicit in this later\nAh from New York there are all people they just want to watch somebody be destroyed over a thick ideology known as left as him and I think it's pathetic\nAnd the far reaching ramifications impact the guys like Bill Cosby\nWho sits in print than at the age of Eighteen years old and American icon\nSits in prison in his eighties over allegations that date back for five decades meanwhile a guy who vowed then and I mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI tell you it was amazing I I had a situation where he actually raped a woman who told us that one eight abroad rink\nWhen Clinton raped her what what the bloody lab told her a roommate what happened the roommates solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the Juanita abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House is president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go their bread Kevin Oh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger double standard it has to do more with men\nVisits me too movement and trying to to\nI Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too because a bunch of left this led truth Hollywood left east okay it's the Harvey Weinstein is of the world with all these young on the news and these\nOld school actresses and all these political feminists taking pictures at Harvey going to his party's expelling virtue that awards dinners and so on while\nEnabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade dating back decades and and all the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ... on the\nCouch and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to a ends up being a bill\nEnds up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood\nThat and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy and suddenly a guy like cabin all they want\nTo make him the poster child I mean it just it pours me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters on summer in terms positions with somebody\nA Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein\nTo to take their daughters ended the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all their connections but they couldn't care less as Harvey Weinstein was a star Harvey winds CNN access Harvey Weinstein was uh making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas\nSo they set their own daughters end of the carrot custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there the daughter that you don't that you got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the ... the what the what rock Obama selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that led to his left this who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary tale for many many boys I've said many times what harmless thing is your kid your son going to do at the age of Fifteen some woman's gonna come back twenty five thirty years\nLater and say oh look at what you did that make more if he's not

Brett Kavanaugh having been\nA confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the fifth rode the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nAnd it gave me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country\nAnd then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of harm in the sense of business is of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very expensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each year it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on through all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that we\nCould do that an important factor in fact a trillion dollars is more than the government actually ... ah either from businesses are on the individual each year\nThey very significant thing but it can be turned back town on the couch and be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and began to review carefully the legislation underway all these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are they are laws that were ... years ago I'm kind of generations ago and they are and perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the national guard it do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency and we can actually beginning to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "22"}
