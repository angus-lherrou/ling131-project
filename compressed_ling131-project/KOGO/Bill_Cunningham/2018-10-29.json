{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "Um celebrate our survivors honor those that we've lost and and I think it's um I I think it's cathartic you know I think it's really um it's emotional and it's ... but you're a part of a community that understands what this is like\nThose the honorary survivor or do you have to leave the the ... or I mean as a trying to stop me [laughter] but some of the details of the ... one of the ... you we've gotten information out to people who are listening about how often do you get a mammogram at what age and that could have been\nWhat about other things that women can do with a self examination of how often should be done shove I'd some input and some are back for a listener as those who am I don't know\nYeah so um we have a four kind of keys to life that we talk about so one is knowing your risk and that is that family history\nOr the next is getting screened so we talked about that or the third is to know your normal so um we used to talk a lot about self breast exams and why that while that is still an important we don't want people to just rely on the self breast exam\nUm it you won't always feel something um and then we don't want people to think oh well I checked myself and I'm fine but you should know what's normal if something changing are you feeling pain is their discharges there alone is the color changing you know you should know what's normal for you and then maintaining a healthy lifestyle is also really important and I also\nSo if they want and low yeah go ahead\nFor me I I'd always been told you're looking for a lump or a pie and so it feels like a pie are hard to hard rock and mine did not feel like that and so when I felt when I felt it was like well it's not all of our piece I was not and if not nothing's wrong and I really want people to know if you feel anything fading there's different of a norm they'll get passed on to find out what's\nGoing on there you mentioned earlier the terms of doctors you know they they see it all the time\nThat they may not be maybe a sensitive and doctors are different as everybody else that you deal with but uh she shouldn't on your experience dealing with the medical candidate probably that you do you think the you know doctors are still have something to learn or they all\nPretty equal what advice would somebody calls his show where do I go\nYeah um I mean San Diego's very lucky we have a ... a great community here with a lot of options um before they receive care um but I Do think that there is a little bit of onus on the patient advocate um and to ask questions and to get clarification\nI'm there also are things where you know you maybe go on your oncologist for one thing but talking to somebody else about\nI'm Natasha or um you know during your radiation but needing to talk to somebody else about the cream that you use on your skin and so um you know you are the sort of um\n[noise] nexus of all of that information and as the patient it it it falls on you to kind of coordinate that but I think that doctors I'm here in San Diego do a great job and I'm you know are are doing that the best that we can and and we're very lucky to have so many state of the art I'm ... researchers as well as practitioners\nBut there was a lot of research going on yeah ...\nYeah we have um a ton of research for Komen funded research at UCSD as well as as salt Institute and at the Sanford Burnham medical research Institute\nAnd Lillian I'm sure you've learned a tone above the summit obviously you some pretty wise when it comes to genes that everything else\nBut I Want to say uh and I do do run is a process where you have to learn but the physicians that I had were amazing um they were very supportive and a lot of the programs now they they give you a nurse navigators\nSo you're able to to really attached to one person who then helps you were you through the pet scans and that and you've got a I'm a cancer navigator and you've got someone helping you with word out reaching the community but also at any one time you're going to get on with radiologist your oncologist and you're a general surgeon you're gonna have three primary trading physicians and\nFiguring out who's going to have you off from work and who's not and who's going to give you medication and then your plastic surgeon comes in there a lot of physicians and so my point earlier it wasn't that they didn't necessarily care they're quite that care quite a bit but your sense of urgency about the you know I'm going to die tomorrow and them knowing you're not going to die tomorrow\nEverything's going to be okay this is just a part of the process I think um that's where having the region having support helps you get to navigate that\nAs we could support a magic but there should have spouses of family members or friends can help a lot\nThey can actually have family members come with me there were there was like a little not a lot of like who's going to go into the Mona time\n'cause I'm going with me um but it's really I'm a really good thing in a tool to be able to speak and on top of your ... your emotions it's no different than any other disease or illness you doing it by yourself is difficult and having a support system places really helpful and even within my my medical facility would just start they have an entire breast cancer support group\nWhere they meet they do painting um they have um they offer\nA massage as they do a lot of things to help you deal with what's going on and they also have support from my husband and they have support groups for them as well so I think tapping into your facility um you know we're ... and then also is happening in the Komen does less resources you don't you don't have to do it by yourself\nLet's talk about the race we sure are coming up here and just several days and a vision of described for those who might be listening to don't really know what happens to show us what happened\nSo we meet in double park um brightened early it's daylight savings time so you have no excuse to not come out and know it sounds early but you've got already an extra hour [noise]\nUm we have about ten thousand people that join us we have 'em in expo area where um we have you know vendors and corporate sponsors and then we do an opening ceremonies\nAnd where will you'll get to hear from ... and here a little bit more about the services that Komen offers\nUm and we also have a survivor parade which is incredibly powerful and moving to see all of these survivors from you know people holding signs um last year I remember looking out to the crowd and there was somebody holding a sign that said zero months standing next to somebody that said forty years\nAnd that to me was why why we're there [noise]\nUm so it's a it's a really great morning and um you can either do the one mile or the five K.\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert powers\nAre Jewish how serendipitous the Jews save\nThe life of Robert Bowers and if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with was he\nOn friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history Deb Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner\nIs a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions as I have\nAnd so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat stimulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and the performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know\nThe immediate reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor said Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds ...\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story\nAbout stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the facts you know Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing\nTalk radio over the last several weeks\nMuch like the er the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples of left wing or ... sending envelopes filled with white powder so many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like secretary defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children\nOf a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nThose in Charlottesville can deal with this for a moment\nThe president said there's good people on both sides you know what he was referring to he was not referring to the tiki carrying torches\nBy the white nationalist and the races marching around shouting racial slurs about Jews or by the way\nThe president's grandchildren are Jewish he was talking about those who want to keep Confederate monuments\nThose who want to keep Confederate ... mind you're much he said there's good people and that side and the good people on the side were protesting that think the Confederate monuments out to be taken down but because that charges not explosive enough\nThe left in the media keeps saying that the president said there's good people on both sides he was not referring to the white nationalist\nHe was referring to those who wanted to keep Confederate monuments now from bill counting EMS perspective\nI I don't like the idea of Confederate monuments cause they declared war on my country the United states of America and killed something the range of six hundred thousand Americans by the way those Confederate who did that road Democrats\nThey you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight\nWhen the president said there's good people on both sides the one thought he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nOn the other side where those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist caring tiki torches\nShouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers and the southern city at night carrying torches there's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's continue we'll get your calls ... coast in Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bought 'em in the seventh inning of four to one [noise]\nBecause Andrew ... a friend of mine who plays left field\nFor the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox\nThose continuous more [noise] still counting hand the great American your calls her next live with you [noise]\n\nWhen there's like\nFox News I'm like the opposite world recognition of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting tragedy\nShows go to the grieving coming\nSchool the French government and the older group and moved to across Europe because the U.S [noise]\nStay strong again try the Sarah\n... lawn the president of the union Jewish students of France calling for solidarity to honor the eleventh victims lost their lives at the hands of accused forty six year old shooter Robert Bowers\nIs doing in the\n\nBack home the Pittsburgh Steelers with

years ago is the judiciary better off today than it was two years ago in fact what's going wrong is the unemployment rate better now than it was two years ago or more people working today than two years ago is the American military stronger today than it was two years ago\nIn fact everything it could go writes gone right and not much has gone wrong and that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar continue their calls will go right to go to Robert know Utah\nRobin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show Rob go ahead\nThanks for taking my call Yes sir thank you\nWell yeah in the middle of the shooting they had Al Sharpton on MSNBC\nAgain and I doubt and then today on again off again and they had a friend [noise]\n\nYou know\nWell I'm ... how about the riots that Al Sharpton started in New York City are based upon the death of a Jewish person what about ... furniture Mart I mean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis ...\nThat's right and I can watch\nGoing a year so not capable of all\nI Know I just I just Google this\nDecember thirteenth Ninety Ninety five the river and Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion martyrs or white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre\nNewly revealed taped show Sharpton is not named Freddy but mentions the least dispute and calls out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton inside at the massacre at Fridays furniture Mart\nBecause the Jewish a small business owner moved into the black community and so I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on its people for this crap\nAnd you know the guy who write to the White House and it was right and actually they are being made right\nAnd and Mrs you're calling from Utah and this is the guy who's now under an indictment now this was in a large media stories that fair to say no the words maybe I\nCan have an error and second page\nAnd and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of the story it All right but I don't know just being concoction would've actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear and if someone would\nIs that in your opening an envelope and you get white powder all over your hands impose on your lap believe me and say fearful tear filled event and this is a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nCover it and you can make rice and I don't care if they're being real\nOwe them a well can you imagine if a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up you're going to bring up anything you can say a word\nWell Time Warner did this to Trump what what if the parent company of Fox\nAre sponsored a play in Central Park that depicted the murder through repeated stabbing of Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the me I'm number number one Fox's parent company never do it but Time Warner sponsored they play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar\nWith a character looking like Trump being shot to death on stage\nAnd the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night now what did the same thing that happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nAdded a comedian who had a car bomb and held his head to head on\nCathy Griffin now is touring the country to sold out audiences\nWhy explained to me Rob why the media\nDoesn't respond\nTo these obvious\nDiscrepancies and disparities between the way they

done magnificently here because of family and faith and academics and hard work the Israeli ambassador to America said that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to be in anywhere in the world\nAnd so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter and the amount of what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media the press CNN and their allies always lecture Trump\nAnd conservatives about our anger our rhetoric in our violence but when progressive explode\nWhich happens on a regular basis like stabbing Republicans setting a trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins\nOr the children are the president whenever that goes on at no point or progressive ever lectured\nBy the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism\nEven when the president is the only one in American history to have Jewish grandchildren\nAnd even though the murder in Pittsburgh had postings saying how much he hated Trump because Trump at Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump\nNever mentioning the hatred the radicalism of the left which exceeds what happens on the right the whole Ferguson and Baltimore all the race riots the shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left\nNever any connections river made\nBetween the cop killers in Dallas\nDuring a rally a black lives matter and then meeting and the White House\nWith those same leadership a black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama and the media never said wait a minute Mr Mr President\nHow do you mean with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops what are we went dead cops when you want them now pegs in a blanket from like bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party conservatism one route Republican speak up\nHave even heard about the guy from Utah who sent rice in to the president to kill him\nI mean have you heard about the white powder the rice an attack\nOn the home of Senator Susan Collins by a left this after she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh nor all the attacks on Trump's children\nHow big of a story would it have been if if the Republicans had attacked the children up or Iraq Hussein Obama oh my oh my lord ... the world would end as we know it\nThe puck receives too

will not exploit to attack President Trump the evil lack of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is such an unapologetic defender\nOf the Jewish community and the state of Israel and so you're a Washington Post ... there's a headline on Saturday that said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo you get your Trump inspiring bombings and Trump indirectly involved in killing Jews and the post supposedly is objective\nThough it's unbelievable yeah\nAre we going to run thanks for your call let's continue and if you're in Indiana I Know in Ohio many other states Nevada especially who were important but when it comes to the mid term elections we've got to do what's right who do you think\nMost of the evildoers in the

Trump's children and a Senator Susan Collins than mobs chasing US Senators restaurants and chase them in elevators and chased him down airports\nAnd CNN will not allow the N. word the mob or being used and CNN add a reporter with the caravan the mobs coming up from from uh from Honduras and they pulled out because it was so good for the Republicans even though factually it's going on they did not want reporting on that\nAll day on TALK about that now\nNo because it's good for Trump there in the business of electing isn't it sad when major news organizations or in the business of electing Democrats\nYes they are well my dad died about in your ...\nSo it said Democrats are liars and cheater at all they are\nWell you know Danny I Want an objective media that calls balls and strikes right

cleaning the FCC\nAnd get them to do the the the arm and [laughter] you know there is ... and under\nNo illusion of character inciting hatred and ... it's ... to do this course and a number of other things or is this true oh\nWell you know Andy the FCC doesn't control cable news because it's not broadcast over the air but the FCC does control CBS NBC ABC or talk radio et cetera\nBut Andy ultimately we get the government we deserve and if more you know fewer and fewer people are watching CNN all the time you cannot watch Chris Cuomo or Don Lemon\nOn a regular basis without suffering some sort of project vomiting or explosive diarrhea especially Don Lemon it's impossible to watch it and their ratings have you taken any particular night Fox News has more than twice the rating of CNN and MSNBC put together\nAnd there was a reason because we're voting more or less with our eyes to watch and we want to watch but you\nCan't watch it all it would drive me crazy I Won objectivity have you heard that word ISIS recently how many tonight sixty minutes did a story in which ISIS has been killed by a the Trump military Trump said the military go get him\nAnd ice has used to be a big deal under Obama how big a deal is it now Andy\nYou know doesn't exist but I\nThink that uh [noise] something should be true it is to say or some other regulatory\nSomething ... you know any ultimately it's going to be up to us we get the government we deserve and if we don't act in the next nine days you're going to have a Maxine Waters and\nJerry ... Adler and Nancy Pelosi\nAnd standing ... and others in charge of half of the Congress and they're not going to legislate they're going to litigate\nAnd they're going to investigate and we're not going to recognize what happens to the last two years of the Trump presidency in fact\nA couple of months ago a Jonathan Turley who's are pretty good guy law professor from George Washington said the first two years of the Trump Administration will be the peaceful two years\nSo they said the last two years are going to be a disaster\nLet's continue now with ah Joel enough Virginia Joel and Virginia Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joel how are ya\nI can even bill cranky for taking my call myself a halfway you have some friends that called me earlier today from Florida and they're talking about ... to kill him I was trying as the Democratic candidate\nFor governor you know that what they're telling me is that they've been running a lot of commercials and the state of Florida\nAnd which to have and also they than having rallies and which both Al Sharpton who you spoke of earlier as well as a lot of um um Maxine Waters and others have been in the state of Florida campaigning and they have been coming up in reference to an indictment\nAnd bobbing this to kill them every time that kind of keeps coming up with the race card I'm Wondering what gets caught fire in reference to the Florida writes\nAndrew Gillum as a socialist his background is similar to the Democratic candidate in Arizona Andrew Gillum believes in the most left wing radical viewpoint\nOf the police department Andrew Gillum is set in the past the guy who would be the governor of Florida that the police department so like occupying forces that began as slaves catchers it's the most radical governor Florida would ever have now they're saying this is not the most uh\nIs that the most exciting character I Know but at least is not Andrew Gillum and at least she wouldn't go to the same route of the Bernie Sanders\nMaxine Waters type and he would take over Florida government in cash right the police departments you numerous police departments and Florida that have said they cannot support this guy because of his beliefs about the police you can't support him if he knew Gillum wins in Florida I I Would be shocked\nBeing called by the people that are called me up their ticket when I was waiting for the people that are written off the air and move out of their fate because from what they're telling me and call it in a state income tax\nCutting taxes are going to come back at all or wherever a actors that it may be probably be doubled according to what they're saying and apparently that's also come out in literature\nSo it looks like a man that kind of a match the state of Florida\nYou know Joel I'm a great supporter of police and whenever a cop has killed I always mention their names there are many cop killers are who have not been identified yet and the cops are dead when you have\nThe

have reasonable borders and David Wray will once again welcome to the bill Cunningham show and David how you doing\nDoing great my friend that you\nGo let me share with the American people something you ever put forth in one of your miss him\nAnd that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and\nAnd the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some saying it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point of Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately describe on the wall Street Journal and organized stunt by political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together in one place and said let's walk to America two thousand miles away no one believes that\nSo what happened with the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media will deal with\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize\nAnd disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states who has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people\nSome of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also a\nMan of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to stay out of this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing ten ... suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me\nWhy don't you take your wife and kids and try and walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this they're trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explained why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands among door and show up at the same place at the same time with precision begin marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intensive medical care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh\nCaravans that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that has an even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual\nAnd I've seen pictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nAre not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably to Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about
