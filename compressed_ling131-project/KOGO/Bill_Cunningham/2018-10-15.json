{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "I kind of have another experiences being the spouse like Randy mentioned being doing military my husband is active duty ah for the army and and the reserve so we have an experience of being in the reserves but also being with active duty so we move around just as much as an active duty of\nFamily might so we have the experiences of children going through separation\nA separation anxiety isolation you know and how it how does impact their social functioning I'm self you know whether it's with their self esteem or their confidence levels so it presents another challenge I think in the parental aspect\n'em knowing when to to bring in outside support when to ask for that support and then how do we even though our community because we're moving around as often as we do um so being in the reserves on that side\nBeing a spouse at that being the spouse of an active duty person and being in the reserve\nThe difficulty for me can be seen like in the form of career progression\nSo say you get out of the military active duty and you know where you want to go or even if you don't know where you want to go if you're geographically located in one place you might have a good idea of the resources you might have a great idea of where you want to work out things like that but being in the reserves and then also being a spouse of an active duty member\nYou know you you move from place to place and that natural career progression isn't always there and I think can be said in the reserves so you go from different unit to different unit and that career progression on the military side it's often difficult to come by\nSo there's there's multiple challenges and being in the reserves a balancing it with your family life balancing it with your civilian work balancing it with your children like it's it's\nI Would not say it's easy at all\nBut a hopeless all worth it\nRight definitely so through the reserves that have been able to you know get my education paid for I've been able to you know reap the benefits of the G. I. bill tuition assistance [noise] um I wouldn't be here working at courage to call today if it weren't with uh all the support that I've had in the military\nDo me about the name courage to call up became the name for this\nYet so courage to call actually started in two thousand nine and so that predates both Christina and I buy it kinda goes it stems from like having that courage to make that call because there is such a stigma even still today like we said earlier with asking for that\nHelp and so the courage to call the thing that they can do is it can be as simple as hey I just need this resource to all the way to how do I use my GI Bill to I Need some intense\nHelp with my post traumatic stress and everything in between so courage for the call is really just that having the courage to call and speak to another fellow veteran has the line is operated on the whole team is either a veteran or spouses and so having the courage to call somebody and reach out and get the help\nThat you need there what is the number to call so you can\nGo to our website which is courage to called dot org the number two and Christina has the phone number\nThe phone number is one eight seven seven six nine eight seven eight three eight that's a toll free number um and you can also call to one one option for\nThe ... review that are from Asia before the closer the program you mentioned the Christian in a moment ago about the cubes and and the the children of separation that occurs ... that occurs are there programs that help children as well through through the eyes\nWould definitely so when we meet a for different coalition meetings there's programs there's grants out there that help children be involved in sports there's there's programs that help kids go to a summer camps\nThey can do these things but you know it's just being aware of the resources that are there so if we have any military families that are they're really\nStruggling with their children like that's been gone mom is dressed as on deployment mom doesn't know who to turn to because mom isn't a new place and doesn't really have a supportive network get\nAnd the kids are really upset they're acting out there's definitely other children that are feeling the same way so if we can connect those children to other children uh through programs um that that really pay for it\nAnd alleviate a lot of the stress and provide some therapeutic environments for the children and that's what we want to do we want to link families with the resources that are really going to benefit\nThem but it's great when you watch on television the returns from deployments you know and love the spouses ... woman gets off the ship and there's all this joy\nAnd then I ... at a time when they go back home and they have to go to get back into life over again there are those moments that are not maybe is pleasant as we bought the families like that but they feel they can they become isolated easily\nAbsolutely yeah absolutely and I also as 'cause see I thought I was also dual military for many years so my husband was on active duty and at the same time I was\nAnd coming home and it it's easy to just get into your world your bubble of taking care of yourself and to isolate and and nobody else understands I'm what you do and we even as veterans tend to do that we tend to hoard up and get together as veterans and\nBecause we're the only ones that are going to understand what we're going through and so it's really important to break through that both for our families and for the veterans and tried to get out there and read um integrate into the entire says\nNo you guys for ... for veterans to get together for ... and move spouses and men and women to give give\nAbsolutely and one of the things that Christina was highlighting is that's amazing about courage to call is because there's so many resources specific to families specific to the veteran or active duty service member instead of trying to call Fifteen different places\nThey can call one place and we can do a basic screening and tell you what would be appropriate for you instead of you having to call\nOh no I'm not eligible for them and I'm not eligible for that when they can literally call in to us to our line and they can speak with a fellow veterans that is going to be able to say hey no you know what you're eligible this is the best fit for your situation 'cause\nI'm as we said earlier every veteran's experience every military family is it a different experience though I was a Navy I was attached to army unit so my experience is not the same as Christine us but mine is also not the same as a fellow sailors so\nEvery experience is different and it's important that if they call in and we can help them find what is appropriate for them in their family\nPeople listening to you guys right now most feel very encouraged by what you're saying and where they can get some help and how can people help I mean Richard volunteers with the organization and I would imagine that the donations to the organization helps as well open people do that\nSo so there's multiple ways they can donate through for clothing through the um listing that we had that operation dress code dot com but also if they go to courage the number to call dot org and they can go in there because the reality is is this is all free to our service members\nOn so we take donations monetary donations as well so if they maybe can't come out and volunteer maybe they've been out of this a business world for a while and they don't have close to donate we need hangers we need other things that we buy for that day the racks\nThings like that that all costs money so maybe volunteering ours isn't work for them but they have the option of also don't\nAnd it's called the Warren County fairgrounds that twenty thousand people and it was friday night if you'll recall the mid west it was cold so I get is tonight it's miss the rain cold yeah twenty\nSome people standing in a grass field uncovered for four hours for a chance to listen to the president\nSo ah I was oh shut off to the side and I waited there\nAbout a half an hour forty five minutes wonder if it's going to happen or not I have the equipment with me so a a nice woman comes as the president's ready to see you know and I said well thank you so I walked ... walk back around came around the corner presidents like twenty feet away says bill hold on I'll be right with you\nI said I'm not going anywhere [laughter] I'm a I'm not going anywhere I'm right here\nSo it came up with some nice days he says he listens to me casually on Sunday night and things for what I Do on television for him I said no problem I Believe in what you're doing and I said to him I said look either concerning twenty sixteen\nNow when you got elected you're going to be like in New York Republican kind of a moderate Republican you've turned out to be well beyond my expectations I said you make Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal Democrat\nWhat you're doing is that is fabulous away exchanged more nicer these small talk and said you ready for it I said let's go so I handed him a bike and I took a Mike and I talk to him for like Thirteen minutes talked a little bit about the rally\nHappening a couple of hours later friday night we talked about the tariffs about Canada and Mexico talked about the show he talked about South Korea whenever the issues Kevin all whatever was talking about Thirteen minutes and I said I'm going to run it Sunday night is that I may be listening\nAs Mr President thank you very much so we're going to play that interview in about a twenty twenty five minutes at the bottom\nAnd then later on and we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous and diamond in silk reminded me hit 'em on two or three months ago\nAbout how dangerous it is for an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal partisan voting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women\nThey vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but there is no more loyal part isn't good for the Democratic party\nThan African Americans especially for American women some as diamond in silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN hundreds Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using for Jordan racial terms racism attacked Kanye West bakari sellers\nIs a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nSo he's you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's I coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an African American woman talking quote\nBlack folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator saying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Kanye the racial draft they had it with him as she spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her\nAnd and it really couldn't have got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take ... seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble said that he's irrational on a madman snoop doggy dog a doggy citizen Uncle Tom and so entertainers\nComics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas and Jesse ... Peterson and Colin Powell\nAnd Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... ... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest\nThe Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools for generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's crow NAFTA policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled the black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all said in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as terrorists arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow why Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the ... media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control we're while I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed\nBy CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter\nOf black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party and he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas\nTo Jessie Molly Peterson the kinds of Lisa rice to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he does and express the right political viewpoints that is why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West\nAnd and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work\nAnd more coming on ... my interview with the president doesn't know the top of the last to our Web Bill O'Reilly O'Reilly factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so\nWe have diamonds Silverman are going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks blacks who get jump out of line much like a southern slave owners would keep blacks are dumb down and illiterate that's the goal of the modern Democratic Party to keep them in line\nWith continued thirty minutes after they are still counting undergrad American live with you [noise]

on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty just everybody moved out\nI don't know what

of Trump is negative I think\nIt's higher than that I I don't recall with all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody's talking the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction\nWe're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by ... a Republican governors house the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing conservative\nWhat if CBS to what's safe from top to bottom organ or is that what we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and the ABC NBC and CNN would take an alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox ... leaning left quite often were Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple\nAnd it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that\nAll you gotta do is look at Newsmax TV or a one American network and you find conservative values in the news that reflects the American people so let's continue\nWhenever calls

here that you can see why you get into bed and I get tired of hearing about that about you'll get mad about companies that why you stand at the\nMount joy we got to go to me you're the color of the day maybe the color of the week you might be the color of the month you might be the color of the year joy [laughter]\nThat was a black cat and how do we ... that are killing them they are in our country\nAnd there's no group hurt more by illegal aliens and African American workers\nBut this CNN's Don limits of this world doesn't cover it that way because they're the mouthpiece for the modern Democratic Party\nThere is no grew more hurt by illegal alien migration into America than African Americans they're the ones hurt most by and poor white folk poor white for workers now most poor people in America are white and poor white folks are hurt by two and they tend to vote disproportionally for Democrats it's unbelievable\nThat fight girl but anyway you know I hated Obama I'd still hate and he's awake at any evil will turn turn I think a third world country up at all\nTime show I Will get will never had a president in the country that I Can't remain calm Seventy oh well we'll try the following president\nPresident said he can't he stopped\nWell you know Patsy uh some are concerned that Obama and Clinton are back out campaign\nYou might recall that Obama said my name's on the ballot this is my third term Hillary's going to continue my policies and they were so roundly unpopular that as soon as the American people living in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Iowa Florida Texas\nHurt Obama's say vote for Hillary we've got four more years of my policies\nThat's what caused working class folks and these so called swing states to come out one hundred percent against Obama and against Hillary Clinton because as soon as they discovered you know what am I vote for Hillary I got four more years of Obama maniacs I Can't take it held that is why Trump was elected\nAnd so of Hillary and uh in Obama and Michelle whoever wants to go out and keep campaigning I'd say go out there remind the American people how much better things are today or you better off today than you were two years ago the answer is no chose yes the answer is hail yes stay tuned\nFor more coming up in a few minutes we'll be diamond and still live from North Carolina and top of the

country talking about when you get when coke and don't want that needs to be paid to point out back in Seventy four thousand dollar salary\nAnd then the people back a problem we are coming into showing it that's right\nKnow ... how can Maxine Waters make like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nShe's been in office like twenty eight years she lives in a four point three million dollar house never takes responsibility for the consequences of her policies as you may know the worst place in America deliver an African American isn't a black congressional district because there is never economic development has never\nYou know ... there's not a number of family ... so you're like a blonde lady when you look at Maxine Waters and others by peddling this craft orders though many blondes Brian\nWell let me first tell you why they have it because that will call get a pack kick back patio at Denver dog a bone that dog was given a big bone living in a four point three million dollar home on a one hundred and Seventy four thousand dollar a year salary\nMet the water do not even live in the district that she represents and there are so many black people that don't even know that that's why they want to keep your mind up close and keep you in a box that they can keep you divide it into\nIn the way the PC pieces that's why they keep throwing racism and race baiting to people\nSo that you can stay the vitamin you not really know what's going on you said it met the water had been in position for twenty seven plus years and have did absolutely nothing to help her own district so back to mentor you have people living\nIn tents no running water and it's a shame and she don't even recognize her own district and black people it's time for them to wake up and smell the coffee we look at who's representing you you wonder what he didn't want to say that it's a white man that's keeping you down\nNo issue all black fellow so called leaders that keeping you stuck in a rock looking really messed\nUp to a dime and we're going to do is what the last ten years\nFor Hussein Obama was in charge of the American president ... Democrats control everything in fact Democrats controlled the states California Washington Oregon New York Massachusetts practically every major city like Chicago Illinois controlled by liberal Democrats like Seventy five years\nSo there's not as an African American has not significantly improved on his own son to Chicago\nTells the possible they can keep testing your dribs their own responsibilities and blame the evil white man or blame Donald Trump will when you can't find a Republican with a search warrant is your golden rule annoy diamond how did they get away with that court\nAnd not getting away with it because people are shaking a walk and people are paying attention to trial right when I think Obama wants the president\nFor eight years and they have the power\nWhat they did was they had to sneak them he gave them an Obama fall back on the hand it tells you to have a coconut smile and they and then at the top ... never come back and he would he was up and they were what the puppet\nMasters pull the strings attached to any one he's working with the American people so I don't think they're quite getting away with it they think they are but people black people my team and American people are waking up in it than the Democratic party who they are\nStill looking at this way I mean you have to think now for the eight years the Bronx Hussein Obama was an office with Eric Holder in ... and all the ... they had to work like crazy on behalf of black folks and I want you to compare silk\nThe achievement of African Americans under Obama compared the two years of drug use the difference\nThere there is no comparison when it comes down to ... Iraq who than Obama they said he was the first black or African American president though he was he was biracial\nAnd his black side did nothing for black both\nPeople want to talk about the justice system the black president did nothing for the black community\nThat a white guy like me cannot say so a diamond one final message would you like to deliver it to African American voters because now less than four weeks so now it's very possible that blacks are going to vote Ninety percent to return Democrats their power they're not going to legislate they're going to intimidate\nAnd they're going to prosecute the president what message diamond do you give it to African Americans all across this great country\nHabit [laughter] do you get a call out there and not want to fight [laughter] we probably could walk away from what we call a Democrat [laughter] I don't write\nIn silicone on Monday a October Fifteen the dummy crowds and I I have a website here I can send people to fathom events website to see where the tri state we're in the nation this movie's gonna be but I Hope it's a great success to you and diamond have gone prime time on me down your prime time\nCertainly has so you want to make sure you got the Democrats that movie dot com to get your ticket Donny cracked the movie dot com to get your ticket when I ...

many other black conservatives black entertainers that'll lead the Democratic plantation that does not bode well for the future of the Democratic party there's no question no one can question the fact\nThat uh if the Democratic party did not have African Americans voting like Ninety to Ninety five percent for them then they would be without any question more minority part and they are today the same phrases really use of course you can just you lead Peters in many others\nBut what was going on with diamond in silk and what's gonna happen with Kanye West in happened already is that you have to keep them on the Democratic plantation\nSo wind up but courage seller said on CNN Tuesday night quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with them and take pictures unquote\nCar sellers is a paid contributor to CNN he's an African American speaking to Don Lemon another African American\nBuddy said Kanye West is illiterate and he can't read can't think\nAnd uh another CNN contributor Tara said ... went on to say quote black folks are about to trade Conyers the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote how in the world\nDoes CNN allow judge such filth on its air when you have black liberal commentators saying that a fellow black person is illiterate and is a a whore and is a quote token negro and getting away with it\nOr she went on to say quote no one should be taken ... seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized in other words he's mentally ill and during all this time Don Lemon the CNN host\nVenomous league lead smile and laugh during the entire time I could not imagine what would have happened with Don Lemon white conservative Republicans and said about a ...\nYup that came from a writer from Steven cold there an awesome it to you that if anybody on your staff did that or anybody on my staff at Bill O'Reilly dot com that\nWouldn't be working for us would they know yeah it's awful right but Steven cold there to hold down a late night show on CBS [laughter]\nSeemingly has no problem with this new one\nBecause it fit what he wanted to do because he's in\nEven the last two nights I I don't watch Kobe or I Can't watch Joe Scarborough I Can't do it but I I read transcripts Drudge Report Bill O'Reilly dot com whatever it is I'm looking at ... dot com Daily Caller and I look at what's going on in these shows and I'm thinking what world do I live in because there is an evolution in America today that's not being addressed so\nWhen I Would ask you how is it possible that you get a butchers and bakers in candlestick makers and electricians and bloomers Don black uniforms put on ... and then march to their death anywhere between six and ten million Jews Catholics homosexual and kill forty to fifty million people crushing skulls and\n... babies that these are average German that did this\nThere had to be something going on mentally with them it was like a mental illness in Germany between thirty two and I did was\nAcceptable bill it was acceptable\nThat's what happened and that's why after the war\nEntity is like the red cross the American CIA the Vatican help some of these people get away get out of Germany and go to South America or Spain or South Africa because it was acceptable but just as America today\nIs acceptable to millions of citizens to Raj an allegation\nWithout any cooperation zero and destroy a man his two daughters and his wife\nYou know it's kind of ... and the bowl\nIt kinda worse than cooperation it's your ensue refuting the witnesses actually didn't cooperate but I mean they're included into\nThe weeds on it because I don't know what happened you know I don't know what happened and I have been criticized for it and I I didn't make any pronouncements about guilt or innocence but the undeniable fact is that it was acceptable\nIn many American Airlines to kill this guy Kavanaugh to destroy him know and that's what you saw in Germany now it's not the same thing obviously you know\nAll right and and you know when I make these points or the media matters and these are the propaganda outfits which would have been great on the jurors Joseph ... okay they are I call them and not say I know I'm not\nWith your question was a good one how could it happen that ordinary Germans and in the United states German Americans are the largest ethnicity okay how can that happen that these people would do with these high end these things because\nIt was acceptable thing I mean and that's what we're seeing in America now we're seeing a rise horrible behavior that is acceptable\nWell there was a Minnesota schoolteacher and moan Monday or Tuesday\nThat put out a tweet about someone needs to someone needs to kill Kevin all I mean you talk about actual killing someone needs to kill cabinet ... a Minnesota Public school teacher put out a tweet Monday that someone needs to take one for the team quote in kill Kavanaugh yeah and I'm I'm reading this and I\nAnd and there's no pro stations the mainstream media your book points out ... on page thirty nine that uh Nineteen forty seven alone an estimated eight thousand members of the ss safely traveled a candidate in the United states utilizing fools document\nAnd that and that their claws Barbie one of the worst the worst in France was actually pay the pension by our own CIA so explain to the twenty Eighteen mine how does the United states government the red cross in the Vatican sent\nThese mass murders to go free and how do we take our tax money and pay someone like horsepower mean like I Seventeen hundred dollars a month how do we do that\n[noise] you know it's again people who don't confront evil one of the great stories in the book is a woman named Alfred E. H. E. T. H.\nAs a young woman she was a seamstress alright World War two broke out and they'll freely signs up for the lady S. S. core she is assigned or ravens ... concentration camp north or Berlin\nWhich was a women's concentration camp Jewish women a gypsy women uh dissidents that kind of thing and overeating at a German Shepherd and terrorize these women for four years what happened to her she came to the United states on a refugee visa\nYou know nobody knew that she was an ss car I moved to San Francisco marries a Jew\nStays in San Francisco for\nAlmost fifty years before the state department tracked down and the portrait of Germany she still alive in Germany getting every month us Social Security\nCheck and it's impossible it's impossible\nIt happens because people don't engage they don't fight it they don't bring it to the attention of people that might matter and you know if you ... Trump\nSituation uh once he was elected it all the rooms in the media changed says you know ... All right no longer was the truth and poor did was get him\nBecause we don't like him [noise] so all of our resources are going to be directed to getting him all the progressive movement is capitalized on that has exploited that\nAnd has walked into precincts where they got me yeah the same people set accused me accused Kavanaugh impacts sure right same crew\nBut no Americans are they don't know what's happening or if they do they're looking away the cold beer lose one view or no because of that no I don't think so\nNo and something happening now you know you have ... his show I guess is in Saudi Arabia and dissident who a headset nasty things in ... and ... is a contributor to the Washington Post but a ... is a Saudi Arabian citizen seemingly he is killed in Turkey which shouldn't have happened\nBut the media the last couple of three days has been all over Trump because they want Trump to do something about an individual murder of a Saudi Arabian citizen that happened in Turkey as if Trump's responsible I ... I mean I'm driving me nuts I mean what can Trump do\nAnd it's even worse because Trump has succeeded in getting the pasture right All right who is held in prison unjustly by the Turks out with your own hair that no no that that's not a story you know the the fixes and\nEverybody knows any intelligent person knows the fixes\nAnd and you can't count on the major media outlets to report the truth or even speak the truth not even close so\nThat's evil in a in a country that depends on an electorate being informed with accurate information again uh you know I I wrote a killing the ss to highlight the fact that this can happen here\nYou know one of the first things that Hitler did was he eliminated the free press yeah All right uh his goons uh\n[noise]\n\nCalm [noise]\nFeet off so will the u._s. be getting a new defense secretary is spokesman for the Pentagon responded to the president's remarks\nThing in a statement Secretary Mattis is laser focused on doing his job ensuring the U.S military remain the most lethal force on the planet Fox's\nGarrett Jenny President Trump responding to a CBS sixty minutes question about the turnover in his cabinet retiring Arizona Republican Jeff Flake would some thoughts on the possible outcome in the mid term elections believe the conventional\nWisdom and I kind of do a house will likely flip the Senate will remain in Republican hands\nAccording to a new ABC News Washington Post poll democratic kind of lead the house Republicans by fifty three to forty two percent and the American league division series all tied up one game each Boston led when the series but uh some five went over the Astros this is Fox News [noise]\nStill putting off building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you've alone that's right where\nCall them start\n\nFirst of all\nYou have a long distance relationship here I Do I have had to ... ships I had swept in with my father a long time ago and we we did a good job we fix it up [noise] we uh eleven hundred and sixty four you understand remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it by a guard or that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there are no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago all really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage day sure everything's on what's going to happen with the mega housing development\nOh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen\nSending us to talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is and he's a great religious later and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got back here we got back I we got back many people actually if you look at it as like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for them to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just eat literally just took off\nAnd he'll be in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right\nNow about your wife ... to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty\nA it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty ... just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nMany jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent ... people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union is pretty brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even know like that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "San Diego",
