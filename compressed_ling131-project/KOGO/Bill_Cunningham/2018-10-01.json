I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and uh after a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace did\nForce testimonies extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listen to our delivery delivery of those words and talk about these sold and the impact it at our life and not have your ... or this is a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon\nJudge ended up ... generally are respected I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible Karl Rove the great political theorist it forward as\nThe credible and believable\nSo one when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and the silliness the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely but but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo ... and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her and capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who once anonymity to testify\nTurned down the opportunity to be questioned in private then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I tried to test her credibility making bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking so one conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think we ... think Karl Rove yeah\nCompletely lost our way because he went on telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and men\nFound Brett Kavanaugh to people even though there was such a notion from both the accused innocent man in a in a court of public opinion and they are they up to the un quote hearing a life with completely turned upside down\nAnd his wife when getting death threats and that his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nOr she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she sat her so she has two front doors you know anybody that has to climb\nDoorbell no there's no snow so obviously\nShe had an issue\nNow just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or that just because she says Brett Kavanaugh rate there it maybe not but all the evidence that she for that so far all start being out of it ends\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend Leland Kaiser\nWho would have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nNow all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the ... with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know I don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that\nWell I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the presidency and twenty sixteen but the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court when his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned critical Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because I\n... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order trick a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves okay it was a very uncomfortable and hearing song it talks about equal rights and gender equality will you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a man as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily how cold and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us that we find out she was all over the
