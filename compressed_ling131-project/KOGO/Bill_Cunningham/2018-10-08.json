so you know we're talking again we're talking twenty ... twenty four and a half years later I I really ... I don't like the word deal\nOf her witnesses either refuted her story I had no memory of the gathering question also the therapists notes never really came out accepted the Washington Post the Washington Post said that for originally claimed there were four boys\nWho tried tried to rape her\nNot one but for boy she said she said she was in her late teens\nAnd then she switched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the mid Nineteen eighties and then she switched back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault\nBut part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were\nBy Brett Kavanaugh you got a proven supposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes then we find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica\nShe went to Hawaii she went to uh the south Pacific Island she went to a French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes\nThe boyfriend also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned a sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh will shed no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nThat she uh the the the second door theory was a bunch of crap\nBecause he came out that they want it to second door in their home in twenty eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that she also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today\nHer lawyer Deborah cats came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really she's done with it so\nMedia turned out to be liars and thieves in trucks and miscreants every every description the second accuser Debbie ...\nA dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supported her story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez\nShaking his junk and her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either and then one of the silent heroes of this\nHas been the porn lawyer Michael ... boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact a cast light away from a weight from a\nFrom a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweat Nick nobody believed in fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward\nBut at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken stayed to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence\nAnd simply parrot it public statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it\nPlus uh as far as\nSupporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a experts and independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice Lee ... spent on my show many times wrote a column a ... this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin all she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kevin O's ...\nAnd you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse but also care\nAbout the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project in others have exonerated through late a DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns and Van Dyke Perry who's spending combine thirty seven years in prison\nOn false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done\nPlus innocent projects it got an innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence destroyed or goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these values are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and show you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show as a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening\nI have a sense that Kavanaugh's going to be a conservative maybe about along the lines of an Anthony Kennedy\nBecause that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock running over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican why was selected I'm not sure\nBut once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team then the vicious lies perpetrated a bone in by the Senate mother mainstream media I got on his side completely one hundred percent\nAnd the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore nor teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborate information in fact it was shown to be false\nIt's because the allegations the title nine proceedings\nBut that were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the facts you put a second front door and her house\nIncluding the fact that uh there were four witnesses that were corroborate her story including our best girlfriend none of them did everything\nFell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out in an affidavit to the Senate how many times that professor Ford lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the mainstream media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett\nA judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this or a judge the judge hardness or wait for you\nAnd so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out

perspective and I made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course a man and you may be a woman\nBut if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man your father was a man what kind of feelings damn towards your husband and your dad your brothers are male what kind of feelings damp tore them and you may have male children or grandchildren doing over the world\nWhere because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and went on a ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process that determined that voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was the ... the fearing the fly was ridiculous in her boyfriend came out and said she was a safe\nAnd some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally is not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says it's if it's accurate\nBut two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door\nAnd had nothing to do it cost her phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii\nWe also went on trips to Central America South America and the euro she had no fear of flying it was a lie in fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face\nMitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you wanna get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts that's what caused the writer for the call bears CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nFat is reflective and indicative of what the Democratic Party things today about Brett Kavanaugh we ruined his life\nPessimistic about America right now but\nThe way this is this mob rule mentality is leaving us down a path to what President Lincoln face as soon as he took office in Nineteen sixty one and that\nIs what I Am afraid of I'm not afraid of democratic control of the house or the Senate or the presidency I'm afraid of civil war and we're on that path and then let these people get checked somewhere and I'm not talking about suppression of votes so I'm not talking about\nThe limitations of their First Amendment rights I'm Talking about\nThem actually getting control without any facts\nTo subordinate their their case without anything else they will stop at nothing when Democrats and and we're aggressive loopholes in this day and twenty eight team cannot win at the ballot box that go to the court for they can't one of the courts they go to the streets if a cat went in the streets the next thing has bloody revolution\n... years yet before we go to bed tonight part of the Drudge Report Michael good one who writes for New York ah newspapers has a great column about the coming second civil war read that we got to run take a look let's continue\nLet's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller I think it was Brian from India that that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think there are people like Brian saw\nOn only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get a power\nNumber two that Democrats socialists progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change ... whether it be the lives that that Dr forward presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies now still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about the four boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen he lied about that in fact it was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to fight them is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that political forces the only way that we are going to become and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce waiting for my beating them at the ballot\nGotta when you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday and that was correct you got to vote in the Denver if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere's no Democrats hardly anywhere there's this sea of red from the the shining see it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone ... and the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts you're\nThere and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice and from Notre Dame and when that\nHappens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... made certain maker you watch that fight\nReally didn't need to thank you today\nTo Eric Holder who still contempt of Congress said that\nNow we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court let me see Billy for the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned malignancy of the problem is but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nOf all of a sudden they stand up and say we've got a question the whole legitimate you process do you recall outrageous\nThe recall and the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media had a meltdown when Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results ed ... elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton in New York Times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a course Salinger was going to win\nAnd then Trump won in up to this point\nHillary and a major media has not accepted the outcome and the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said\nI may not accept the outcome of the election\nBecause it looked like it it's rigged however the media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary's said let's be clear about what are you saying and and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a show in New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show and New Hampshire welcome to the bill kinda game show Joe go ahead\nI could Mr Cunningham thank you for taking my call um agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and your summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important to have you ever heard of Jonathan\nSimon and his book code red about a ... issue voter Misha encouraged in America actually in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bind up him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama\nThan citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever but Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there's hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast\nBecause of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show for the new terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and English and the companies that are going to say that I think it's only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine as program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast\nThe machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance and the person that runs the city that Democrats in most cases\nThey're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the terms who's on the ballot what have you know and the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm would a\nWave quotes from Republican to add to the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a
