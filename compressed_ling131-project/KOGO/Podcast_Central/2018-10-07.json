that yeah there's not a lot of\nTimes you do need to do too much you know maybe Twenty years later start to recalibrate but\nAll of a sudden I Want you to imagine you know wherever it is that you've been working fulltime it can be Thirty years or forty years you've been working and grinding we all have in your diligent\nAnd you save every paycheck you put that money in your four one K. and it happens and you didn't take that extra money and spend it for less than a nicer car vacation you we we're diligent you put this in your four one K.\nKnowing how important that we can be some day and and you've seen this grow and you watch it grow and now you're retired and it's at this nice balance and feel accomplish try and it's just all those years of hard work paid off I've got this balance\nAnd you want to go roll it over into your Iran now you've heard that rollovers or a good idea people have told you to roll it over and it is a good idea and I'm going to touch on that in a minute that it is a good idea\nBut you don't know what you're doing and you just go to process the roll over and you fill out the form or you call the company to do the roll over and you don't do a couple of key things and you give a minimum of twenty percent of it away\nAll in federal taxes immediately\nBecause you'd miss some boxes or just said the wrong thing yeah yeah that's how that happens to him off too often rally\nThere's a lot of great things about your ... or your for three beer ts pee wherever you work your company plan it's easy to set up as we talked about comes right out of your paycheck that's great a lot of times you'll get matching it's free money what's not to love about that tax deductions only real negative\nIs that you're just limited to whatever choices are in your plan it doesn't it's not to say those are bad choices necessarily just not very many but there's\nTens and tens of thousands of more of investment options that exist in the world right and you might have had options and you're playing what are the odds of all the other ... that that those are the ten best nothing else that exists out there that's right for you so logically we know that's not the case\nSo this whole thing about a roll of ... when you leave or you quit or you retire\nYou get to take it from company plan into your own plant IRA stands for individual retirement account you set it up at whatever place you like you know ...\nCD Amir trade or vanguard or Schwab or wherever and this whole roll over when done right there's no taxes there's no fees that just goes from the company account to yours and now you've got unlimited investment options out there which for retiree especially is crucial as you tend not to find great conservative auctions and set up four one K.\nYou know some of those index market options are pretty similar to what you find out there and that's\nBut the conservative options tend to be a lot more expensive than the IRA world so it's really crucial to do rollers for most all\nRetirees and when you do it right you don't give anything away from taxes are fees you lose nothing it's a beautiful thing we recommend almost everybody to do and roll over but if you go about it on your own and we've seen and we've heard people do it man just one little box not checked here on a former one\nOne piece of nomenclature urban you didn't really know how to say correctly or ask correctly\nOr or not done or or rally here's an example and you know if you've got your own company stock inside the four oh one K. and and you had an opportunity a great point you know to do what's called an un net unreal lives depreciation a ...\nThat strategy and not a lot of advisors are you know really familiar with that it's a way to get your own company stock out and ... and on attacks favor basis Bradley\nThere's also some people that have what's called post eighty six after tax dollars in their four one K. plan and a law changed a couple of years ago where you can take that money and roll it into a rough but if you don't ask correctly they won't you won't do that you'll says the heck\nOh he won't get to grow money tax free ouch you have investment options that exists out there that are right for you and then you go roll your money into something and you lock it up and now you can't get it back\nAnd you ... a year later it was a mistake and you wish you hadn't done it the bottom line is this is really crunch time it's that twenty or thirty or forty years of all that hard work and one paycheck at a time putting money in the midst please have a conversation if you had your own trusted\nPerson are ready for this that's great talk to them about it we know many of you do and that's what we would love to be trusted ear for so what is our process that ups in a way\nThe first question Davis he loved to say and I I think it's great our first question is just how do you take your coffee I mean we just want to make this it's a conversation when we first meet shift you know tell us about your situation tell us what your questions are what you're\nTrying to accomplish and we spent some time with you know we learned everything about you let me go build you accustom retirement plan we take all the things into consideration how much income can you generate how do you handle inflation how do we become tax efficient making sure we never run out of money how do we handle medical events in the future if they happen\nI mean back to my Social Security there's a lot of things that come with this plan to work in a gift to you and customize for you know costs no obligation but certainly in this whole conversation of your investments that's the engine that runs your plan and for for one k.'s and your company sponsored plan your IRAs let's analyze what you have\nAnd let's help you navigate through this roll over process in these other considerations so you get it right the first time that's our mission here is to retire right and do it the first time and we'd love to help you do the same and all you need to do is call that number's eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight\nOnce again eight eight eight five six four seven eight Seventy\nRetire right with that scene in white ... alongside David Steen and Brad why have seen in my retirement income solutions guys we're just about out of time on the show today so let's start to get some final thoughts from both of you really your main takeaways from today's discussion of some of the\nMajor what ass as we head into retirement\nLet me start with you what are your final thoughts today do we have any\nTakeaways Dave ... night and we haven't had anything you could have in Frank away do we ever have any ... I see I I have a copy guy ... yeah\nWell I loved at a case you're just listening to the show folks and just tuning in and the last part of of today's show up you know Gen started off are telling us about a recent trip Gen would you just touched on that again I'm sure a you know for those who might be joining us late in today's program\nWell we talk a lot about this analogy of how you're working years are kind of like climbing the mountain and entering retirement is coming down the mountain and and financially how your decisions and and all these things are going to change and I was just sharing with data and Brad it really brought that\nAnalogy to life for me during our recent hiking trip because I was going up the mountain just muscling through it looking at the top scene where I was trying to go it felt so good to get there and at the top of the mountains but I realized that was only half of that trip that was only half of the journey now I had to come back down and everything changed\nWe had to get political known him [laughter] relates with [laughter]\nAnd uh but I contributed I feel I feel like at at least they did one thing is you pick the lock what'd you do a good hanging you have to answer this question I um I was [laughter]\nSo there was a recording supposedly somewhere and and there was an eye pad in over here and I figured out where the recording on the pad was good I'm good I'm good at I've had so you'd like we're like the IT guy in the room yeah thanks yeah yeah\nSo afterward we was in little league area and afterward went to the Piazza ... Familia uh this nice new place they changed I guess it was dates street into uh\nUh they closed it and turn it into a plaza and it ... it was just it was just teeming with people there was a band playing there and it reminded me of Europe in the sense that it was like nine thirty or ten but there was kids out playing it just felt like a like an air but they built that old reader building ill greener building is now a\nFour or five story you know housing effort it was beautiful\nAnd I was I was like this is crowds proud because at my friends in there and I knew it was there I Want to go see it and it's just very proud that the city achieved this I've I've been kind of on high since then and then I found out this week is the orchids an onion\nWhere they give out an orchid for the best architecture and onion for the worst and I found that the ... or ... pointed out the nomination for this plaza the ... million but it was a nomination for an onion\nBecause uh it it's it's not a real Piazza according to this person a Piazza supposed to be like an intersection of different streets and it is at the intersection between two streets and they were\nReally like a long actually there's a word it and I just wanted to do a dramatic reading of this if you don't ...\nI was going to wait till the end I just want to say I think I Know who wrote this do you I think I Do there's a few facts here there are a few statements about the ... that were said to me by a person\nAnd maybe everyone just has really strong Piazza\nCenter [laughter] I just think there's some identifiable complaints that I think there are either made by this person or this person is speaking for a person a show listener yes\nOkay is it it sounds like this person you useful in the escape have ruined and we needed to know who wrote this I Would have some shit [laughter]\nSo All right here's my start [noise] [noise]\nThis is a there are upset about the naming of it yes you know the fact that this happened in little Italy which is supposed to give a taste of the Italian experience as irresponsible\nWe're witnessing the mallet vacation of the city it is not mall that mimic city centers but the opposite since malls\nHave become the locus of the communal experience the improper naming the odds are familiar with guilt will give visitors and future architect I Love the [noise]\nThe children\nShould worry about the children the wrong idea of what a Piazza is\nSecondly let's talk about the design in Italy had a nightmare it would be the ... the scale of the street lights on steroids the maximum security prison lightning\nPrison white lighting a grotesque plastic fountain yachts has become have state the bench is not cheap cables I Will not even mention\nThe design of the buildings overlook the million everything is wrong here that for the baby was\nClearly the best is except for the day which is acceptable to quit\nHaving I never liked some things so much that somebody so much ever\nYeah can I so I have a conspiracy theory like nationally that the Daytona five hundred actually happens like every three weeks that's just like how often I feel about it it's like I have a\nBay buccaneers always play the Atlanta Falcons\nYeah that's a good one too but so I Swear or goods and onions happens every two weeks I'm sick of hearing\nAbout it [laughter] it's I think that's true I think it really has every two weeks [noise] so anyway the Piazza's fifth fantastic\nSo I ... chairs\nSo I brought launched the other day yeah and I didn't want to eat it at my desk and so I was like I'm going to take my brought lunch over to this Piazza mhm\nAnd if I'm honest I was kind of trolling I was like armed with a with like on bridge ready to be unleashed because you have things well I thought\nThat what was going to happen as I was going to sit down at those tables that are by the cafeteria where like the older the for the food a hall is they're going to boot and they were going to say no you have to buy something right at which point I was gonna say I was going to make a scene right that if this is this other public space or it's private\nSpace in your face of the Mike Pence going to an NFL game\nIt was a lot like that but then no one Saturday and I just ate my lunch quietly and left and had a nice little after ...\nI think a ... it was it was it was great it was really proud of San Diego and I and\nSome of some of these statements aren't totally wrong the street lights are up absurdly out of scale\nIf you look at the ... the ... they they're like they're the suitable for like a space\nEight to Fifteen times that big comedy it was really life but I think that helped [laughter] not that it's ... like the debate it's so big oh here's a comic Lee absurdly big and the fountain has really ugly and real tacky\nOkay well it was night at the end of the buildings with us I think you would [laughter] I said I knew that let me be clear\nThe paving is except it makes up the ... yes\nAll right so this weekend we've of were a little loopy because we have been planning politic fest\nSaturday I'm In one of the debates we're going to have their please come politic fest dot org but you know what you might be too late to actually register online\nDon't worry don't Fred just ...\nJust come we'll ... we'll take care of you at the desk there we've got a like seven hundred registering right now we we're we're actually going to do better than break even we might be able to fund some investigative journalism\nWhich is huge so they do not like the Texas Tribune a trip festival which made like two million dollars ... yeah that that things bond room now this big deal now [noise] anyway we've got a great a bunch of things one of the things we're doing\nIs a debate hosted by Cal matters about rent control so prop ten now I got at his desk from El the the other daily him because uh we sent out a message that said that prop ten would\nWith draw the Costa Hawkins rule which was a moratorium on rent control down through Liam said that is incorrect so tell me dear sir\nWhat is Costa Hawkins and what is proper ten\nTo ... and a state law passed Johnny five that did a three things are set of three things\nAt brevity to cities and counties from playing rent control like I said in three key ways one is no record showing a single family homes so no city or county can do that\nSecond is it gave landlords their rights are maintained their right for them to be able to reset rents whenever rent controlled tenant\nMoves out that's called the vacancy vacancy control yeah right now I'm trying not to use that for his allergies 'cause no one that's a nightmare rank right so but the idea is that if I'm ... controlled a unit and I'm you know there for three years\nNext person comes in ... can charge whatever he wants in the market or for that person and that new person would be under the new record troubles\nIs the third thing is that it's such a date for when\nA cities can limit rent control or implementing wrecked show on buildings spelling of construction so for the most part of the Nineteen Ninety five year ... you cannot have record showing buildings any newer then that\nIt also set in stone the years that cities that had existing wreckage will policies um uh had their their construction year except for instance in Los Angeles or the city cannot update it's it's ... for any building bill after Nineteen Seventy eight\nBecause cost a hug and so there's a three sort of key things so you can and some cities have\nImplemented rent control regimes that work around those provisions but they're the three main provisions and it does prohibits that are most ... most forms of new record\nDrove from going in so very limited okay so if a city wanted to do rent control right now yes what kinds of things what could they put in\nThey could say the wreckage on buildings but before Ninety five okay invited those buildings were not I'm a well provided us in the family homes so apartments\nSo the vacancy issues really interesting a lot of I I managed to weigh the other day about this in in one of the points that the landlord represented was making was that\nThat vacancy thing was important because they want to be able to reset after somebody moves out to to clean up the the apartment to improve it invested in it but if they're stuck with this deal price than that um would inhibit that sort of change that sort of a progression right\nNot only that but I Do represent their huge allocation issues right so like someone who's out and there's all of a sudden in a super high cost area a new record drought apartment for super below market\nRents how does that who gets that apartment right you know and obviously I think advocates of what that to go to go to a person of of of less the less means but there'll be nothing or sort of be very hard to stop a landlord from giving it to anybody ... right and so um that's a that's sort of one of the more you know during the ... at the state level\nI'm ... to your next ... that's ... you just saw I gather\nYou're listening to community could actually high\nI'm San Diego city attorney mark Elliott victims of domestic violence deserve a safe place to reclaim their lives think justice and begin healing family Justice Center is dedicated professionals providing services that how they can become survivors\nAnd break the cycle of violence and you need help called eight six six nine three three home for a visit San Diego dot and gum and fashion and ... the viewers states and the family Justice Center\nIf you're a victim of domestic violence help is available you're not alone\nAnd if you know someone who's being abused there are resources available to help them that's the message the setting of city attorney's office wants to communicate better campaign now underway for domestic violence awareness month of course anyone can be a victim of domestic violence women men doesn't matter the age sexual orientation or economic status\nThere are a few organizations in San Diego there do offer health for victims of domestic violence one of them as the family Justice Center which is part of the city attorney's office here in San Diego so joining us on the committee could actually during this domestic violence awareness month to discuss this very important issue that affects so many people that are humidity so\nDiego city attorney mark Elliott ... Lopez Cooper the executive director of the family justice centers are both of you welcome are being here today thank you good morning you know it's an important issue that we face in our humidity all across the country but here in San Diego\nOr being the best of violence months so Mars city attorney obviously you know you you see these things happening in\nYour in the business of handling of certain kinds of prosecution and that kind of thing but could you give our listeners kind of an overview of your impression of just how serious this to Mexico pilots problem is in San Diego\nI I think it's very serious here in San Diego our office the San Diego city attorney's office prosecutes about a thousand of these cases every year we have a very high conviction rate so these are cases that we can prove I think what concerns me the most is that's what we're aware of\nBut domestic violence is still an issue that people are very reluctant to talk about and the purpose of focusing on domestic violence during October is to encourage people to come and reach out to the services that are low locally available to them\nAnd also to get the conversation going because these things are happening in our own families at our schools at our place of employment\nI and a lot of people don't want to talk about it is deeply deeply personal so I Want people to come out of the shadows and reach out to the San Diego city attorney's office or a family Justice Center and get help and get the resources that that that they need to become survivors and get back on their feet\nEvent as the executive director of the family Justice Center obviously you work intimately with people who are victims their family and and others involved in this is this problem and and this issue what is it can you describe what is it that causes a lot of victims of domestic violence as as Mara we just saying\nTo not want to talk about hesitant to say anything about it and ... and sometimes has it obviously to report it\nYes you know and as you mentioned at the beginning of the interview\nYou know domestic violence has no boundaries it affects men equally as women um it affects a straight relationships the algae beauty community um at the family Justice Center we see clients that are as young as Nineteen years old and even into their seventies and\nWhat we see is that like the city attorney mark Elliott hadn't mentioned is it it's a very personal issue\nYou know domestic violence as complicated\nThis relationship is like no other you know where there's control where there's isolation where there's threat where someone is actually dictating to another person what kind of make up they can wear who can be their friends\nWhat clothes are they going to wear and it escalates\nSo it's it's very complicated I'm at the family Justice Center what we're trying to do is to transition victims into survivors to really provide a safe space for someone to come to receive resources\nAnd to feel that they're going to be protected but most importantly what we're really trying to do is offer hope\nIf someone's listening right now who is a victim of domestic violence knows of somebody who is more concerned about somebody that they know can they contract you directly the family just to set a directly and when they do what happens\nTo someone can contact us they can walk in were open Monday to friday eight to five o'clock six one nine five three three six thousand is our phone number\nAnd they come in and we will immediately connect them with the domestic violence at the cat we will give me an assessment\n'em and see what their situation is like and what we're really trying to do is to listen to our clients we understand that every situation is different every family is different um so the services can be different\nKnow there's not a a one size fits all to this problem\nUh we are a team of dedicated professionals that the family Justice Center we have\nPsychologists social workers nurses\nUm we work very closely with the police department or with a domestic violence unit or a team of attorneys and so we really look at the problem and look at what are the needs that this person I'm really needed at this moment\nAnd how can we help them but at the same time always letting 'em that person take the lead I'm On what type of services that they that they require\nAnd if I could just add to that um we're conveniently located downtown we're right next to a trolley stop there as parking underneath our building so I Know that there's often concerns about going downtown with um the inability to find parking so the location is one one to two broad way\nAnd if somebody's unable to get down as um as if it just mentioned they can call or eight six six number in addition to the local number it's eight six six nine three three hope they can also visit San Diego dot Gov slash ... J. C. so there are many ways to reach us\nAnd that way of somebody's listening right now they can get information even before they call you or ... report what's happening and when they walk in their concern is going to be ... I assume when they call to they're going to be afraid\nThey're going to be afraid of who knows and and whether they'll be discovered so to speak or whatever how do you handle that\nSo I guess I can start with that there are there's lots of concerns I think when you and actually reach out for help um some people don't speak English we have interpreters were available to assist them\nSome folks are concerned because as we discussed it's deeply personal and they want their privacy respected this is a private place and we bend over backwards to make sure that people feel that and they know they can talk to us and they can trust us with this very sensitive information\nThere are some folks who are not documented\nAnd the family Justice Center is available to everybody we do not check papers I Want the community to know that a victim as a victim to us and we care and we're going to be right there for them and we are not looking at immigration status\nOf there I think often concerned about what they're going to do with their children a lot of folks are running um they're coming down to us and they they've got very young children we are able to provide 'em supervision to children we have an area within the family Justice Center where the children are supervised ... while the parent\nOr receive the treatment and counseling and initial um assistance that they need so I feel like we've really looked at this problem from all angles so that we're welcoming and people come to us and we're going to make sure that when they come they can focus on the issues and won't be there for them\nAs city attorney question that are held for you if a woman is in a situation where let's say it's been happening and [noise]\nAnd um you bet you said that it tends to escalate um if it continues if there if if something is not happening at the moment that you would call police obviously are nine one one should be called police just to say if they're concerned about being followed\nWhat what would you advise in those situations where it may not be an emergency but it's a serious situation nor frayed that when he gets home let's say something's gonna happen mhm\n[noise] right well if you know if anybody feels that their life is in danger they should definitely seek out the police department um you know in call nine one one um [noise]\nWe safety is paramount at the family Justice Center\nA privacy is very important you know sixty percent of the cases that we see come to us for a temporary restraining order so these are individuals who fear that their life is in danger\nOr we have a group of attorneys that are able to help them to file a temporary restraining order that day to protect them and protect them so yeah so so working closely also with the family law system with the family legal system\n[noise] you know this problem as you said earlier goes from teenagers to very senior people obviously you so you all ages and all kinds of people who are victims of this\nUh when it comes to relationships and when this begins are there signs in younger people's first relationships or when they're considering being with somebody for a period of time are there things to look for that you could advise people about [noise] you don't have you\nOn that probably sees it from the ground more than I Do I hear more about it when I'm Out in the community I'm visiting and the city of San Diego\nBut I I think that um even in a young relationship it was a couple of things you can say you've got victims have grown up around domestic violence and that's all they've ever known that is what they believe to be in a normal way of living of expressing their emotions and their love for somebody else", "show_name": "Podcast Central", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "07"}
