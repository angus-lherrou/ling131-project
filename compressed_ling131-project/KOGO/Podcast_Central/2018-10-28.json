{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "And everybody laughed out of out of hand this cycle that's right retirements not this finish life right at the starting line\nRight you worked all these years this is supposed to be what it was four and we're blessed now to live a lot longer and certainly healthier for a longer period of time where you can enjoy this so it's starting law it is the starting line folks and you're going to inherently have some money yes of course you're going to use right away and then yes we will build you like I mentioned maybe a\nA bucket where it's a ... year buffer of investments their cash or cash equivalence and you're spending that money\nBut what it's doing is there is no volatility on the money that you need soon and yet if you keep money that you know you won't need for the first ten years or more retirement in some sort of diversified portfolio sure that money will have some short term volatility to it but if you know you don't need it for at least ten years\nThan the volatility wouldn't technically matter unless you just couldn't stand seeing it in which case we would also teach you ways to lower the ... even on your long term money exactly brat so [noise]\nYou know hopefully not too much of a tangent or rant there Dave and not kind of I kind of get going a little bit but it's hard not\nTo Brad you know you got we've got thousands of listeners right now who could very well be abstinence this planning that are having a little bit of a tough time\nAnd I would say we we all we we've been mentioned in a lot this last year more so in daily you mentioned earlier on but the market up trend for the last you know almost ten years or whatever it is now since you know bottoming out too and in late two thousand eight early two thousand nine it's caused a lot of people do enjoy these games and there hasn't been a lot of these scary moments\nIt doesn't go forever some of these ... that kind of happened in twenty Eighteen in January and February in a couple of times we even throughout the year\nI think it could be a healthy thing I think right now these jolt or if there's some people if you're getting nervous I think that's a healthy good thing it's called a wakeup call it's a wake up call and it's a wakeup call that's happening before anything bad has really happened right\nSo if you're starting to realize man you just just a small corrections that have happened already make me real nervous than you definitely need to come in and see us and we need to put together a plan right so that way bigger corrections that inevitably will happen don't completely rock your world\nAnd folks that that's us reaching out to you\nThrough this microphone through the radio and an opening that door as wide as possible leave your checkbook at home said all the time\nThey do checkbook at home and we're going to build this for you at no risk no obligation to you and you get to see the depth and the quality of the work that we do here and you get to take it home and then make a decision is Epstein a white going to be the right fit\nTo be sitting at your side and making sure you have the boldness and the ...\nBest retirement possible well I'm going to give you that opportunity I don't get me to give you a number right now to call and that's eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight once again eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight\nTalking today with gave Epstein and Brad white they are fiduciary advisors were that scene in wide retirement income solutions guys we have a little bit of time left in today's show focused a lot on volatility and sit on the other risks that are out\nThere but Brad is there anything we haven't covered yet on the today show that you'd like to make sure we discussed before we wrap up\nHey Bradley I got this you know folks but we you know ... another way to minimize volatility is making sure we maximize all the sources of income that we know that will be coming to us and one of the big major uh sources of income that most of you will have out there is Social Security\nAnd Social Security is really complicated they've set it up to be complicated\nAnd most of you is not\nProperly educated we'll get it wrong and literally leave tens of thousands maybe over a hundred thousand of lifetime benefits that you paid into over your working career that you left on the table earn benefits that you did not get back\nMoney you paid into that you did not get back that would really be sad I don't want that to be you and so when we're building Bradley a retirement income plan to help people minimize volatility okay minimize risk gets returns that we need in order to have\nThe most bold retirement possible maximizing not just getting by but maximizing all that you've done one of the key ingredients to that is making sure you get Social Security right\nAnd if you're married and how to how to best maximize that between the two the two spouses and there are so many strategies gang that can be overlooked\nAnd the timing of when Detroit with them and so gosh you know I could go on and on about how many people we've had\nBeen doing Social Security has now for nearly three years thousands of people have come through our conference center it and learn so much not only about Social Security but how it integrates with everything else that makes you you rally when that's done correctly\nThat in of itself Jen you know will reduce volatility because if we're getting you know the the most we can\nFrom those sources that we know work\nThat are coming in Social Security if you're so fortunate to have a pension if you have some rental properties along the way\nIf you've made some investments or a lot of your money is in investments in retirement accounts or ... retirement accounts how do we minimized taxes so for minimizing taxes that means we're having to pull left from our accounts and if we pull less that means more money is in the accounts\nAnd folks when more money earns more money and so all of these things integrate chat and allow us to have\nBetter chances for keeping pace with input inflation minimum ... or a X. absolutely eliminating the the risk of running out of money\nBefore we run out of time which is the number one worry Gen of all retirees you know that's you know that we don't want that to be you so what is it that gives us elevate says that uh the opportunity\nTo have the boldest retirement possible war we maximize every aspect of what makes us up financially is having first the blueprint to retirement dot\n... can you build a house my friends without a blueprint no you can't can you absolutely willy nilly\nGo into retirement without a plan well you can but good luck with that you really run the risk there I mean you make it ... far riskier\nWhen you don't have a plan and how you're going to pull from news accounts for the first time\nHey if that's not a shot between the eyes when your paycheck stop for the first time in your lives your choosing where to pull this money from and if you're doing it willy nilly uh you're most likely than doing it knocked tax officially\nYou're most likely taking way more risk than you need to and pulling from the wrong accounts could be selling low instead of selling high that can be done quite easily\nI can really get on a soapbox here Bradley I don't want anything about your retirement to be willy nilly\nYou know I don't think you want that either folks you you you want nothing mystical\nOr up to chance of when your paycheck stop what your future looks like which could be twenty Thirty years of retirement which is historic\nAnd that's why it's so important for all of us today what happened in generations preceding us we're a different group were far more at\nMuch greater risk today because we're living so much longer God willing\nThat's a great risk but you know to make this money last twenty thirty or more years\nYou better have a plan you better have a plan for that money\nBecause if you go about it willy nilly you could be that person in your early eighties healthy and out of money and that would be a disaster so I always like in a Bradley think about you walked into a theater\nAnd the courting opens and it's a movie about your retirement it's a movie about your retirement and\nWho do you want being the star do you want the IRS to be the star of your movie do you want a medic Cal facility to be the star of your movie no I don't think so do you want the stock market\nAnd the way the volatility has to be the star of your movie Epstein and white want you to be the star of your movie and how do I best help you be the star is give you a plan\nPeriod end of discussion leave your checkbook at home we will build it for you this is the no embarrassment zone we've seen it all and so we're going to open the curtains wide for you to come on and and be the star of your own movie give us the opportunity to help you the phone number is eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight\nOnce again eight eight eight five six four Seventy eight Seventy eight\nEven listening to retire right toward that scene in white remember that number games just share and again it's eight eight eight five six four\nSeventy eight Seventy eight the shortage tune in next week for more insight with gay that scene and Brad white I'm generally jak thinks filler thing everybody ...\nEpstein white retirement income solutions as an independent financial services firm that helps people create retirement strategies using a variety of insurance and investment products Epstein and white retirement income solutions is not permitted to offer and no statement made during this show shot constitute tax or legal advice\nThey use peyote video cam why I have to go live\nIn the cocoa\nNew center I'm Phil ... the president has ordered flags be flown at half staff after the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue\nVery heavily this that when you just described as a mailer from the building trades group or the union mhm they're running under the moniker\nSan Diego against hate\nOr the building trades council the unions have they been hitting zap hard now for um these ten year old comments she made about um about\nEight year old girl comments right ah oh no no no two thousand six email so yeah\nYeah so yeah two thousand six she she had some correspondence with a a famous or infamous local anti gay activist and I'm ... I remember broke that story and it has now come back to hunter there's one a mailer here from the building trades council\nUp talking about all of the things she said about how she doesn't want I'm gay people to be allowed to teach stuff like that so that's hunting or\nYeah I mean it's interesting if only as a demonstration of of\nThings change when the climate changes and you become vulnerable I mean this is the third time Laurie is F is run for election in either district district or an overlapping district\nAnd these comments have never kept her from winning before right but the ideas that the climate is so polarized now or maybe not as her polarized now but the situation has changed so much now that this is now a real vulnerability for yeah this this\nIt has um it used to be I mean Kevin fall or want it has a Republican against Lorena Gonzalez yeah he got the firefighters endorsement over her that year and you know it's the point Loma Republicans sort of the yacht club Republicans\nWere were always a real strong force in it so it was never a given that it was like a a guaranteed democratic see it All right and now it's like wow it's a very heavily democratic seats so for um ... too when it's going to be you know but she's the incumbent that's the other forces incomes never lose right\nRight and and she so you might have a ... if it was open last time you might have imagined a a Democrat having a good chance to win back in two thousand fourteen\nUm but she had this pseudo incumbency status and now she's still hasn't she has an actual incumbency status now and that's a big deal or at least it's traditionally been a big deal will say if it's still a big deal\nIt's also just a district despite all these mailers and the national stuff factoring into it that seems to me so dominated by things that are really specific to that community sell like airplane noisy and speech drinking and vacation rentals\nAnd just things that are yeah their own its like its own world\nI was just talking to somebody today who's ... heavily involved in the race and and they're like they're having trouble understanding why you know people aren't distinguishing between them too much and I'm like well on the major issues like that\nThey're almost perfectly in lockstep so the other of course rival is jet Dr Gen Campbell she's um this is her first race right for some reason for off a she's a Democrat and now she won the second place in the run up in the in the primary in June\nAnd yeah so she is one of these fliers I found in the in the neighborhood or has a ... talking about airport noise and how she opposes\nThe expansion of the airport terminal one which we've written about and then it has Gen Campbell thing here I agree with the expansion Gen Campbell God of course on the social media saying no no no I'm just as hostile to it as as a ... but again that's the the theme ride that on these local things\nThat the that the um if you do care about local policy that you're in that district probably going to be most attuned to they're almost lockstep but there is some vast significant beyond that that those of us who follow city politics are well aware could really shake\nYou know the future of the city up if it goes a red or\nBlue [laughter] yeah and we'll get into it but I I guess the the basic playing field here is that\nDemocrats have long had five four majority on the city council if this race where to flip they would have a six three veto proof majority meaning\nVirtually anything that the marriage did they'd be able to override if they so chose it would really change the power dynamics and potentially give Democrats an opportunity to run on their own progressive agenda um it's not clear what that progressive agenda would include they haven't\nYet made it a central part of their message here is you can see the message here is lawyers that said these things about gay people uh Laura's after the Republican just like Donald Trump um\nDoesn't mean that they don't have an agenda but it hasn't been part of the sales pitch\nAnd I got kind of a shock the yesterday when I got a poll from the building trades um council and the consultant running that effort\nAnd it was a poll said it was attracting pulled didn't have any positives and negatives about either cash just straight up which one do you support and it had a vast down ten points to the challenger Dr Gen Campbell and so it's like ooh wow well\nI think you knew that there was that this was\nA potential real loss opportunity for the Republicans\nUp central real pickup opportunities for the Democrats based on that the outcome of the ... a primary that Lourdes F was an incumbent ... has it was it was the only person who had that advantage on the ballot and she got less than fifty percent of the boat mhm so\nShe couldn't have won outright anyway\nBut you would have expected against the field of lesser known first time candidates except for a Brian Pease had run before but\nUh for mostly first time candidates with little name id you would've thought that she'd be able to get to fit over fifty and that the Democrats would have a tough time of\nPutting together a winning coalition it was surprising to see that in the primary if you just added up all the Democrats together they actually would've beat her yeah [noise] so local issues have a\nWay of transcending these sort of national identity or discussions about Republicans and Democrats that for instance is a bitter splits with some of her Republican colleagues over land use and vacation rentals and uh that came up and your interview when you're asked her about the midway community plan right what does that\nSo midway community plan is this a it's the area around sports arena\nAnd um basically the city has been in the process of updating their training plan for almost a decade it was passed earlier this year and um it added the capacity for quite a few more homes there by changing the zoning and I'm\nA lawyer Jeff basically said that she she kind of put the brakes on it it was in the home stretch it was coming through committee\nAnd she sort of slammed on the brakes on it I'm trying to get some incremental additions to it which is very proud of a but she actually came under some criticism from Scott Sherman her fellow Republican city councilman who said you know let's be real here this would be sailing through if this were not an election year\nYeah so let's hear her describe what she did when she came across this plan\nSo when this you know initially came to a couple of years or more ago\nI sat with the those planters and said it's really important to look at the traffic flow because this goes through mid way to um obeyed to point Loma traffic flow is going to be really critical so there were you know different iterations and so when the plant came to me right before\nA that committee um you know I got a briefing but then I really took a deeper dive into looking at it was like oh my gosh there's nowhere near enough traffic mitigation and I cannot\nYou know with good conscience move forward or something where you build a lot of housing and it was like we need housing unit housing well yeah but you also have to move\nIn the so then you asked her about that a beef she had with a Republican Cali\nYeah so you you mentioned getting hammered for it to your colleagues Scott Sherman set of the city council committee hearing when it got the lady said if this wasn't an election year we wouldn't this which sale right through to you have any response to that yeah that shocking\nAnd with friends like that [laughter] I mean seriously why didn't you just come and talk to me and I would have told you you know exactly what we've just been talking about right now but well that was a that was something\nThat was something again you know this is that that sort of phenomenon about local politics is is more local than even the city you know like you within the city there are going to be discussions where Republicans and Democrats have no sort of I'm signaling going on right\nInto ... earlier point I I think it's worth putting the finer points on that like in this district this is one of those issues land use development or increasing density it's a in a number of different ways has been a hot button there over the years\nYeah and especially if you compare it with Scott Sherman district there just I mean almost night and day these ... airplane not noise and things like that just aren't a factor that he deals with\nThe I'd say you asked a Gen Campbell whether I'm you know she agreed with the mute midway commute but again she's kind of in lock step but she she had this kind of thing she goes to yes I agree with that but she should have done it better she should have gone faster and\nBeen involved with the community earlier should have been more proactive about solving issues sort of\nIt's another another indication of a lack of foresight if people would only think well wow Sandy is growing so rapidly and we need more housing for more people but you can't just plop down ten thousand new residences and not have away from people get in and out [laughter]\nIt was cancer of should tell us first just the about the Susan G common for people who are probably familiar with the name but don't really know much about the organization itself give us a little thumbnail sketch\nSure so I'm very proud to say that the majority of the work that we do is local here in San Diego county and I think that's kind of what sets us apart and people know this isn't just common brand it's very big everybody sees pink or in October\nBut not very many people know what we do a behind the pink ribbons and so Komen provide services for a low and middle income uninsured under insured women making sure that they get their mammograms biopsies ultrasounds MRI's any of the things they need to get an accurate diagnosis\nAnd then once diagnosed we will also pay for all of those things\nThat you need in order to complete treatment that maybe your insurance doesn't cover um transportation to back and forth to medical appointments\nOr rented mortgage when you're out of work because you're in treatment meal delivery um help with lymphedema sleeves wigs all of those sorts of things and so [noise] so did you come and it's very proud to step in and support local San Diego and and then I Am twenty five percent of the money that we raise goes toward research and that's to finding\nThe cure or the next breakthrough in treatment 'em and all of the things that as you referenced that we really hope that we see some time soon\nBut a lot more services and probably who are not involved ... or don't have access to services probably do the do it ... just financial support but just the general support that it off\n... the emotional support as well um help with um help navigating the medical system it can be very complicated and overwhelming when you're trying to figure out a medical speak and witch doctor I go to for this and that and so we do that we do care coordination\nWe do a lot of outreach into the community we have mobile mammogram events throughout the county all year round\nAnd the race for the cure is our biggest fundraiser of the year that allows us to provide all of those services\nOr we're going to give our listeners lots of opportunity to learn more about the race for the cure and how they can be at a ball but first we want to introduce you to Lilian who is this yours isn't ... survivor so long and tell us told us a little bit about your story of how your involved now as the author survivor\n[noise] I was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer last July and when it happened I didn't have much exposure to breast cancer while I was in my family I didn't really understand the extent of what was going on\nAnd I didn't have it with anyone to turn to respect for getting information or just support or you know groups places where you can go on talking about what's happening\nTo hurt us as a Jew called me one I you know I knew the pink ribbon than I've seen those are all around and my husband actually called\nI'm coming in and they opened up to a lot of resources and that's when we learned about the race and got involved with the race for pure and for me was really to when it hit home for the most is that I was able to find a lot of information on their website about you know was breast cancer what all of the resources where to go what to ask\nBut also when the actual race happened I was right in the heart of my the reference part of my chemo and I was able to really draw the strength from seeing all the survivors or it helped me tremendously being able to see women that had been beaten the disease and to know that it wasn't going to take me\n[noise] what was the toughest things that looking back when you were first diagnosed and there's a lot of tough times I'm sure a difficult times that you go through but uh what was the what's been the hardest thing\nFor you actually I've I've had three different hard things um I Would make them I'm the first one was we we first got diagnosed and I say we 'cause my husband and I sort of be considered as being a joint thing and effects everyone in your family\nAnd when we were diagnosed we we didn't know really what the diagnosis was and how bad it was we didn't know that had gone through my nose and they weren't sure if had gone anywhere else in my brain my liver\nAn initial scanned they thought it might have been I'll swear and waiting for that and navigating the system because the physicians ten you know they've gone through before and they they know most likely it's not this and it's not that you don't\nAnd and so your sense of urgency and their hands of urgency don't always a line and it was about a month where I was waiting to find out and they're like oh we'll have examined two weeks it the way for authorizations ... from your provider and like\nForget that I'm paying for it I don't know now I don't I don't want to have an hour with this\nThing and me I went out and I want surgery now and and they were more you know you know that that month was really difficult not knowing and I know how bad it is and dealing with mortality and am I going to die and all the things just like when you process that I'd\nNever felt fear like that before and that\nWas really difficult um but what I Will say to everyone and that's afraid of people oftentimes don't want to hear bad news and so they won't go get tested I won't go to the information [noise]\nNot knowing I'm is bad but when you have a plan of being able to offer much a plan and do something about it is very empowering and I think you need to balance that out and say okay I I don't want to hear the bad news but let me get tested anyway maybe it's not going to be bad news and if there's bad news I've got all these resources to help me\nSo there were two other my second one was um dream my treatment I'm having to adjust I was off for over a year and having to go through the adjustment and some of the treatments weren't necessarily the most pleasant thing in the world [noise]\nUm I had a complication that most people don't have to have an algae the pain meds I'm sort of hope you always made me sick and so the thing that was supposed to help me was the thing that was causing me a lot of problems I didn't lose weight though um [laughter]\nBut that was pretty uncomfortable but it wouldn't be something that a lot of people would have to deal with but I unfortunately had this out to the pain medication um so that didn't really bode well for me dream my bouts of pain and in the last piece which is now kind of what I've gone through is you have this fear coming back\nAnd I am now I I just I have a blog and I was just reading about that it's like the the fear of you know Rick ... and not knowing and for me that's why I fight so hard um I Can't put the tagline for myself I'm In sales\nAnd my Thailand is that I fight today so that others don't have to fight tomorrow and for me I don't want anyone to have to go through what I went through and so I'm I'm scared and I want to make sure that we find a cure and this never happens anybody\nWell it's great to hear him and the way that you're obviously helping be a blessing to other women who might be in a similar situation like that and that's a shame that you talked to a lot of women obviously we're in a situation like China or I'm a I'm a ... there's been\nA what are you what do you find when women first contact with Susan Komen organization\nWhat are the first question is what are the greatest concern um\nI think people are absolutely concerned with their mortality and as you know am I going to die from this disease um is it going to disfigure me what will this mean we'll have to get 'em insect meal I have to have doubled insect me\nUm and what will this need for my family and my future and and so it's scary people are just scared 'em and want you know to have knowledge is power they want more information they want to know how can they take charge of it how do we develop a plan how you know as well and said that's really empowering and so they want help in formulating that plan\nAnd and the women that we are serving we have resources for the entire community um and lily in reference to the the questions to ask your doctor and we have that for every stage you know I feel on what are the questions I should ask have been diagnosed with breast cancer what are the questions I should ask them having surgery what are the questions I should ask and\nI think that's a really important because sometimes you go into that doctor's office and you're just\nYou just want to hear yes or no and they give you all of this information and you go home and you think wait what did they say and what did I and so um you know having those tools we always encourage people to bring somebody with them to the appointment who is like you were assigned secretary who's writing down all the information\nI'm so that you can look back on that but people are really just don't know how to navigate the process so when they called Coleman and many of the folks who call us don't have resources that we um we just helped a woman who was driving from Campo Ninety miles for her treatment multiple times a week\nAnd she said you know I just can't afford the gas anymore\nSo we were able to give her gas card so we we mapped out how many more treatments do you have how many miles is that let's take care of your gas for you or we had another woman who called she was a single mom and uh she was going to not have her surgery because she didn't know who would take care of her kids while she was having surgery and Komen paid for her ...\nStart to fly out to take care of her kids that's not the kind of thing you can you know putting a claim with your insurance company for 'em but it was the difference between her getting the treatment that she needed and not and that's really where I think its citizens you comment is unique and able to really step in and support people\nLet's give our listeners some hope to because through the years obviously the research that's been going on the round of options and things that have occurred over the euro obviously every year I imagine there's more being learned about it [noise] so where do things stand occur Italy and in the fight against brusque\nWell out one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime and in San Diego that's six women a day but we know that with early detection of survival rates are really incredible and so I'm early detection getting a mammogram every year is really important knowing what's normal for you and knowing if there's been a change in your breast is is very important\nUm but the research that has taken place I mean some of the medications that have been discovered Komen research some of the\nUm ways that we can identify and track no if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes\nAnd have really become incredible and are keeping people alive as well as reducing the need for certain surgeries are making the quality of life a lot better so uh well we don't yet have the cures for breast cancer and there are a lot of different kinds of breast cancer so we're", "show_name": "Podcast Central", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "28"}
