I'm going to ask you to\nYou know to put your you know you know put your you know glasses on or or your binoculars on and look down the road Twenty years okay what's the cost of long term care than to be you know ten Fifteen Twenty years from now\nWhen when the likelihood that you might be any entering the age where you might need this then in the cost has not eight to ten thousand a month\nYou know at sixteen to Eighteen thousand a month that's what you need to be concerned about and how do I yeah ... and so\nThat's what we need to be you know and that's what I've seen a white you know we we you know we spend really a a great deal of time teaching our clients how to build and construct\nA retirement plan that they can have in confidence and have confidence in those those buckets those pots of money that fill up every month and and we spend them down at spin they automatically fill up ... I Love that visual\nAbout what we also need to do is we need to protect those pots right in in the event life throws a curve ball we get an illness or ourself or our spouse and we have adequate income or insurance that helps as meet that challenge\nAnd there's lots of choices out their folks\nOf insurance has to choose from that get this job done you need to be a experts in this and and how do you become an expert is sitting down with an expert and in coaching due and teaching you about\nThese options in these choices in how you protect one another or protect yourself\nOr if you're married protect each other\nIn the event you know we get an illness that is not covered by our healthcare\nIt's covered by our money\nOr a special long term care insurance so if this is something that is a a hole in your plan\nOkay that that might be keeping you up at night\nYou know or going off in retirement with out this knowledge or without this protection and it can strike literally overnight I've

it and they teach you how to maximize Social Security and everything else how to minimize risk in taxes\nHow to build these pots of money that never stop and how to protect once again that phone number eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight\nGuys we had just a couple of minutes left so let's start to wrap things that Brad any final strategies any any final thoughts you like to share with us\nYou know ... what we've seen and again I'll say a several hundred times we could say thousands of times over whatever that the number is but so many times over we've seen the confidence happen right in front of her eyes\nMhm yeah I Love that Reverend Wright as we've\nFinished going through presenting you know this person's the couples plant in a very refreshing way you know tears definitely make their way and in our in our offices yeah\nI'm a fortunately sometimes for for not so great reasons and and sometimes as I mentioned a refreshing way for what I think is a good reason and it was a someone who just really at a hit them out of nowhere\nGeared up just because he just all of a sudden this wave hit him of how hard\nHe and his wife it works you know their whole lives you know put a couple of kids\nThrough schools through a going back to home through then getting rid of ...\nYou know put themselves through different life events that had all of us along the way that you have to get over was somehow and write their butts off and dust yourself off and get up and said what they go and they thought they were doing OK but they just you know they're they're responsible people and even though they've they could see that they had done some good stuff it it\nJust was really shaken him to the core of will they truly be okay\nAnd in this meeting of well to your point I don't want to hurt by this point too much but um you know he had shared with me that he just had had because of this sphere and because of the things had gone to several\nOther presentations or financial individuals in and had gotten a kind of a constant theme of of feeling like um it was constantly kinda selling him something\nYou know a product or an investment right out of the gate and I'm so as as we had gone through this plan and discussed everything we discuss their whole lives cut pretty much for about an hour and a half and we hadn't talked about a single investment recommendation yet and and yeah so he he uh teared up I'm just kind of all of it was hitting him at once of\nWild this is truly a plan we're really going to be okay and that's what we love more than anything Aaron and you know we being who we are as human beings he was kind of apologized you know I'm Sorry for this and\nAnd we told them quite the opposite uh nothing fulfills us more doing what we do then to see the true human impact of what financial planning can do yeah you know like I said this is always a means to the end what our skill set is\nIs how to get every dollar at a Social Security are skill set is how to make sure you can reduce your taxes wherever we can find a way to do so or skill set is how to you know find better investments strategies but all of that\nWhole fully is just translated into this confidence this happiness this human element that we'll hopefully are striving for and it's nice for him without even realizing it to kind of affirmed that\nThat we're able to help him do that and hopefully help others do that far too often people do come see us and it's you know my gosh I Wish I didn't done that I Wish I'd done that differently I Wish I knew that at a time and we don't want that to be you and you don't deserve that after all these years of hard work to be you\nThis is a great positive experience right again these were tears of joy was a good thing and the example we just gave you and more often than on it smiles and its laughter\nThan some combination the above it's a positive experience you get to really\nFeel and see your life play out and know that you're going to be OK forever and you're going to feel really great about the in particular things we teach you to help achieve this and maximize this and make the right decision so giving you that confidence giving you that peace of mind giving you this retirement income plan and all the strategies in\nBetween [noise] you know it's what we love to do we've seen so

twenty five mile an hour winds nine hundred storms earned and everything that was simply allowing them ...\nWorth all the debt that the state will take on a the riverside press enterprise or its editorial board came out and said that more money might not be the answer and instead you know we should be slashing regulations that made it make it harder to build\n'em some of the opponents include John Cox\nThe Republican candidate for governor and the Republican Party [noise]\n... is also a bond related to housing 'em but this one's a little bit different\nI'm so several years ago voters approved a tax on millionaires um this was back in two thousand four and it was meant to fund services for the mentally ill and then we ... up that tax I'm back in twenty sixteen\nUm and the idea for that was to spend some of the money on supportive housing for the mentally ill\nThat plan has been held up um because some opponents sued over the use of that money they said that supportive housing is not um how we should be using that tax money and they it was supposed to go only towards services and so I'm all that money\nIt's been held up in a lawsuit and counties are just sort of sitting like millions and millions of dollars that they're afraid to spend so\nThe legislature said let's put this on the ballot get voters to okay directly the use of that money on supportive housing you know so the idea is just that I'm with voters giving an affirmative yes to spending\nThe money this way or the state can borrowed two billion and funds um that it would pay back using that millionaires tax extension um the arguments pretty simple uh supporters say supportive housing is the best way to reduce homelessness among the chronically mentally ill\nUm the state Democratic Party the chamber of commerce a lot of local leaders from San Diego on both sides of the aisle have endorsed this\nUm that includes Toni Atkins tug floria Myrtle coal brand main shine um the California association of counties as a supporter remember counties are just sitting on a lot of this money that they're kind of afraid to spend less they may be sued\nThe opposition to proposition to is fairly limited um there's in fact not much of it um but the criticism out there is that voters knew what they were doing when they set aside this money for mental health services and they wanted services for people with mental health issues not housing and those are two different things\nAnd the intent of the voters was to do one thing that the other and this bond sort of overrides um the previous bon language\nOr one named opponent is the Contra Costa chapter of the national alliance on mental illness\nThey said it's um [noise] you know it's difficult if this money gets set aside for housing it's actually difficult to build 'em housing units are for mentally ill people and so if we think we're going to suddenly be able to build that sort of housing it's actually going to get opposed by ... and and other groups that don't want these\nI'm kind of facilities in their neighborhood and the money should instead be spent now an services rather\nThan on housing that may not get built anytime soon or ever\n[noise]\nProposition three is a water bond it's ah that sounds familiar we passed a water bond in June that was a four point one billion dollar water bond we also passed another water bond for several years ago and twenty fourteen that was a seven point five billion dollar water bond this November's water bond is an eight point eight billion dollar water but\nIt'll cost about four thirty million dollars a year to pay back and this will be over the next forty years\nAre the biggest chunk of this money is two point five billion that will go to protect restore and improve quote watershed lands\nIn specific areas of the state what's a watershed Lynn a it's a pretty uh nebulous term a it's a place where there's a watershed mhm chair watershed is essentially an area where water drains through it\nUm in every area is divided into a watershed and so one could imagine that everything is a watershed\nUm but specifically so money set aside for watershed lands in the Sierra Nevada mountain range and one that would be interesting for San Diego is there's a supposedly a two hundred million dollars from this that will go to help or the salt and see which is a\nSort of water shady land out in imperial county I mean what's interesting about the solvency is that part of the reason that has become an issue part of the reason is drying up part of the reason that dust um is feared to be going into the air sort of toxic mixture of dust there's some debate about how toxic\nIt is but that there's dust coming up from the sea as it dries up is that much of the water that used to be used in ... county for farming in the imperial valley is now coming to San Diego 'cause we are signed a deal I'm about Fifteen Years ago to get a lot of water from farmers out there to San Diego is one of the reasons it's drying up\nOur water supply is doing that and um this would go to sort of alleviate some of the concerns about the sea becoming a dangerous\nAnd um if that doesn't happen some farmers out there have threatened um to blow up this water deal and so this is an interesting way of having the state\nFund part of a problem that San Diego has at very least contributed to 'em there's also seven hundred and fifty million dollars in here for repairs to federally owned water projects and the Central Valley um the federal government in theory owns and should be a maintaining\nUm this water system but um this would direct state money to that of course these are California farmers so it ... you know maybe it doesn't matter if you think the federal government should be paying are not\nOn the supporters of this include John Cox and Dianne Feinstein what yeah so John Cox obviously the Republican for governor Diane Feinstein obviously the Democratic senator um they seem to both be interested in getting the votes of Central Valley farmers there it is yeah\nAnd the league of cities the chamber of commerce and ducks unlimited are also supporters\nThe ducks unlimited vote next time somebody asked me what the salt and see us I'm going to say obviously it's a sort of watershed yes yeah that's great\nI'm so opponents say that there are still a lot of unspent money from the twenty fourteen water bond I'm also they say that\nThe list of projects this would fund include some regional projects that typically are paid for by local water agencies so you know voters statewide would be paying for these\nAnd finally they say it doubles down on environmentally unfriendly projects um like big dams um and in fact a big environmental group is the leading opponent the Sierra Club of California\n[noise]\nAlright ... for for a fun change is another bond but for sick kids\nThis one is for sick kids so this would authorize at one point five billion dollars in bonds to expand in renovate California's children's hospitals\nUm it would cost about eighty million dollars a year for thirty five years I'm now the money is broken up into sort of three chunks and by far the biggest chunk Seventy two per cent\nUm would go to a group of eight nonprofit children's hospitals um that group does include rabies here in San Diego\nWell there you go um another Eighteen percent would go to a group of five you see hospitals have weird\nPoint to mention on that in a second um and then the final ten percent will go to other public and private hospitals you know for a children's issues or programs\nUm hospitals naturally are big fans of this measure or radio alone has spent more than a million dollars supporting it uh the state did approve children's hospital bonds in two thousand and four and two thousand eight and eight and it still has about thirty billion in on issued bonds still from those measures\nSo I Want to go back to the Eighteen percent chunk that goes to the five you see hospitals wise that interesting [laughter] so it sent me down this weird\nWormhole roped Ryan to over the last couple of weeks\nBecause um the the ballot measure actually spells out what those five UC hospitals um that would get the money are and one of those hospitals is\nThe UC San Diego children's hospital now I've been living here for six years now I have a baby who is used a children's hospital and I never heard\nOf UC San Diego children's hospital and the reason I've never heard of UC San Diego children's hospitals\nBecause it does not exist and there's another hospital in this group I'm In Orange County that also does not exist Orange County a survey by the children's hospital of Orange County which is one of those private entities that tend to different pot of money\nSo you know Ryan I have made some calls asked around like why does this list UC San Diego children's hospital was this about 'em and people I think I told you correct me if I'm wrong that essentially just\nThis money would go to UCSD um and it would be for you know the things that it partners with ratings on it would be for services and programs that\nThat served children but there is no UC San Diego children's hospital everybody seems to agree on that yeah go for pediatric care um\nAnd they could also partner with rabies and spend what would between them be a hundred and Ninety nine million dollars\nThank you can do you approach a dress code I Love the name and my brief little description of already tell us what it's about what's the purpose of it is really\nYeah so I probably shouldn't dress code actually started four and a half years ago in St and Sacramento and it was called dress code there\nAnd it came down to San Diego and of course we had to give it our own name so we named it operation dress code but it's really about serving are transitioning service members so those females that are coming off active duty and going into the civilian workforce\nAnd we really want to wrap around them and support than not only give them business closed but also shoes accessories as well as workshops in a full fun day for our female veterans soul\nTo get to some of the specifics before we do we tell our audience what the need is and how serious it is when you're talking about helping these women who are coming out of the military\nYeah it's definitely a big need because when you're transitioning\nMany of us have worn the uniform for over ten years and so we went from high school directly into the military many of us and never really had that chance to wear civilian worker tire so when you wear a uniform put your hair in a bind every day it's very different than going in a business suit and interviewing for a job\nAnd we know when you look ... field guide and that\nHelps you as you try to secure and make that change into the civilian workforce\nIs there a way of those words that you could describe because us through it what it's like to leave the military go into the civilian life form which you can but it was a different stage in your lives early can you describe what that's like just just cut him from a psychological of social standpoint\nYeah well I mean the easiest way is you're losing a part of your identity you are no longer active duty so you don't really fit in with that environment and you're not truly ever going to be a civilian you may be in a civilian workforce but you're never going to a hundred percent identify with your civilian counterparts so you're kinda in this\nIn between ground and you face so many barriers are ready physically sometimes mentally emotionally\nAnd this is you know trying to find close to where it's just one more barrier to some people that sounds simple but when you're Ari compounded with all of these other challenges of trying to integrate into the civilian workforce\nTrying to find just another thing and and acting the part doing their part is sometimes very challenging for these women\n... coming out of the military school she had been there for ten years or more I mean you come out of every orders life you don't really have to worry about what you're wearing most of the time anyway\nRight absolutely and so when you're in the service it's really about you doing your job you know when and I kind of look at my civilian counterparts an example I went on a business trip recently and the gentleman I was when he had the same suit\nAnd he literally brought three different shirts now if I were the same dress for three days\nAnd magic and how that would have went over\nOn as I was teaching and so it's it's very different for us transitioning as it is you know a a gentleman can't there's so many resources for them and it's very different for women coming out\nDid you have an ... was locked up when you were coming out and you're on a job interview or ... meeting with a perspective employer\nUm well I Will say that at Baylor my friends love to joke that I say I didn't know how to dress for the civilian workforce many of my friends they still don't know how to dress for them to the workforce\nBut um I think I probably weren't my hair and a button for the first year like steel posts service so I I had a lot of great women around me that supported me so it wasn't as big of a challenge but I see it every day in the work that we do on through courage to call we see women transition all the time and they do face that every day\nOr measure that being in the military though there is also asserted advantage to that in terms of the editor in the work life because obviously your life for those ... those period of years you learn a lot about just how to relate to people of how to do a job\nOh absolutely it definitely set me up for success and the civilian world I learned how to manage many different personalities and you really get to see I get to see the world when I was in my twenties I got to travel all over the world and see so many different things so\nI get to bring all of those experiences and that knowledge with me if I went into the civilian\nWorld also with us in the program as ... as soon as the program manager for courage to call a program that\nYou're just part of this operation dress code the ball but let's talk a little bit about operation dress code of course there are a little more specifically already was saying just basically what how this works for them and the closing of ... how do people actually sued if you're if you're coming out of the military how do you take advantage of this\nWell we have twenty different locations where we have a drop off Ben's on throughout San Diego county a woman who are currently in the reserves currently active duty currently transitioning or possibly even have come out of the military can sign up and operations WWW dot operation dress code dot com\nThat's where they can register for the event that they uh they can also sign up to be volunteers if they want to help in any way even if you're not a woman who is transitioning or who was part of the military can definitely come and volunteer and give your time\nAnd in terms of people who\nAre are looking to donate to do to contribute to the cause of describe what juggler used means\nWell gently used is\nLoosely uses hopefully almost new [laughter]\nUm no we're not really looking for anything that\nYou know might have any stays around looking for anything that might have had any homes were really looking for like maybe business casual or even a professional type where that women would really feel confident and going in for an interview or even having as their professional work um throughout the week\nOh imagine any woman or anybody was to contribute to the closing of you have to put yourself in their position right All right well what would you be what would you want to wear and when you talk to some of the women there's ready was meditating a moment ago a lot of times maybe they don't know exactly what they should where they've been in the military for a significant period of time did you see that happen\nAnd so yes uh I met with a lot of women at a hike recently and I pass out the information and they were saying oh that's so good because when I transition I didn't have this nobody you know brought us these\nThese ah groups nobody brought us to these programs it was just going to these conferences this transition workshops and that's it there was no outside resources that we could actually benefit from it and pull items from so it's great that women can come out and actually leave with literally bags in their hands to transition\nShould've been drifting too when you're sick about it you were saying ready about how you transitioned into this back into the civilian and having been in the military and I'll just socially emotionally and physically it affects you\nYou know probably a lot of people I assume that you find maybe you found yourself that you don't think much about maybe what you're supposed to be wary\nNow when I mean there's so many other things that you think about that clothing is the last thing that you're worried about on when you're coming out that's that's the last thing you think about but it's actually a really important thing to think about as you're transitioning\nIt may not be fair but it is as\nIt is unfortunately that's the world we live in and again I always go back to if you feel good and you feel comfortable and you're wearing and what you have where you know we have the skill set that is going to translate into the civilian workforce we just need to have that confidence in field guide as we do that\nI Would imagine Christian and when you talk to some of these women who have gone through it I measured UC when they walk away with her ... her bags full of a a business type of closing do you see a ... a greater confidence\nUm because a lot of the women you know whether they are like I said whether they're currently active duty where there too and they have transitioned and you know they have children they have other needs that are there to be met so you can always go out and spend what you'd like on professional clothing so\nJust having that need met and knowing that your service not only is important and valuable to yourself but also important and valuable enough to other people to contribute to so that you don't have to spend like you know your hard earned money like we all know that in the military backed the pay isn't that great so you don't really come out with\nYou know a plethora of funds that's going to be available for you to go out and purchase your brand new wardrobe oh that was issued to you and you're in the military so coming out and being able to get this for free is wonderful\nRead of your other women who coming out of the military who are really who really do have a tough time\nOh absolutely and we see it every single day it\nIt is we have so many challenges and not be you can't navigate through that and I've been out eight years and I've gone through my own struggles and I continued to you know go back and continue to address some of the things that I dealt with I'm In the military\nBut we are stronger and more resilient for having gone through that but there are definitely things that we face in the military that will stay with us for the lifetime and that we continue to face as we transition out\nStuffing changed since you left the military or and so today in terms of of those people who do leave the military and go back the civil your life or is it easier at all does it below dirty provide that kind of assistance and are there more services available like mental health systems and things like that um this program to help people\nUm yes I Would definitely say that we're making steps forward absolutely is and yummy transitioning like I said about eight years ago\nA there is definitely more resources there's more things available I think that there's still time that we have barriers because we don't know there's", "show_name": "Podcast Central", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "14"}
