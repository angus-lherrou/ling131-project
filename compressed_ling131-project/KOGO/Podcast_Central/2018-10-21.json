{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "Yeah and we did that's just demonstrated in it's well documented of how many how many kids are still going through college and still finding themselves living at home\n... ... you know in Dave I can speak to this right you are in her sixties you have a daughter who's in college now right to college cost you know you guys when it was time to go and well you know it's you know it's it's sixty thousand a year forty thousand\nWell fortunately you know Ruth went to a state school right you know a San Diego state let's be uh uh in over I with dean's list to go ... go aspects we love our aspects and roofs doing really well there and and so ... the kind of took it easy on her mom and dad\nBy you know being were residents of California is going to a state school tuition at San Diego state was affordable for for us and we were able to pay for this out income so\nUnfortunately not the same case for everybody the same day you've got one child like my parents had one which I Am in a lot of people have two or three or four and maybe not go in the state schools yeah\nLet alone you know another sentiment that's common is um ... the housing prices here\nYou know what you're ungodly right for somebody in their twenties to try to think about right alone a real estate crisis that happened which means you can't just put three or five percent down anymore right so how are people in their twenties who are fresh off of you know maybe student loan debt right starting job even Southern California with our cost of living going to figure out a way to save early on and get a house\nBecause you come up with a twenty percent down payment on a on a medium price home in San Diego five hundred and fifty thousand\nRise and so a lot of our clients also have the sentiment of being worried about maybe their kids and their future and sometimes that manifest themselves in their own retirement plans were maybe they're\nAfraid are scared to spend money and they want to leave a large amount um as a legacy benefit to their kids um so that that's something they'll be able to inherit\nRead also they realize and hope that that's a long way away right how can I help them now so how do I properly gifts things where it had a gift from what a gift tax laws had\nWhat what what can we do or not do what I mean we have for what are the rules ends scene maybe some of these effects that you're going through with your own parents it's also has a lot of our clients making sure that they said it was you know I don't want to be a burn and on my kids\nSome day for health and long term care concern happens to us so what kind of protection can we put in place what kind of trust in power as attorneys in wills do we need to have\nDo we need to have long term care insurance can we afford this um right right and so this is just you know again for for this generation retirees the sandwich that may have a lot of these considerations you know on your parents above and maybe a lot of questions or concerns on your children below I just think it's a real important topic in general\nThat and I don't think that we get questions on on both sides and other all the time right I Know in twenty Nineteen um the the concept is for us to do specific events are right around this uh-huh but we don't want people to to have to wait or have to come to a specific time we just want to invite you to come on in\n'cause this is certainly one of the many ways that we help everybody\nComes into our doors and everybody that comes into the ups you know white\nYou know retirement income master planning process of part of the conversation this is a part of the conversation right if you haven't heard you know the first part of our show if you're just tuning in now we spent\nSome time earlier talking about what our processes right when you pick up the phone and the number I'm about to give you or you come to our website and you you know request to

weighing on your mind that we can help answer and maybe help give a lot\nPeace of mind and happiness towards the goals you been thinking and wondering about an physically showing you how to achieve that\nYou know so hot with so many people have come to our doors not everybody becomes a long term client sometimes we'll take a look at everything you have and realize you've got a lot of good stuff but maybe we can just week a few things here there\nAnd that's going to be well worth your time for others there's probably a lot that we need to help us but you know what the best time to find that now out is right now too so whether or not people become long term clients whether it's an overhaul or just a minor tweak we're proud to say everybody says that it was worth their time and it's a positive experience to come on and there is no cost there is no obligation we've got a great team here\nSo when you pick up the phone and call this number which is a day five six four seven eight seven eight\nOnce again it eight five six four seven eight seven eight we've got a friendly person that's going to take some basic information from it and then Dave Epstein here my partner president ups you know why there's going to give you a call on Monday find the time to get you in and see how we can help so once again that's eight eight five six four\nSeventy seven eight or you can go to Epstein and white dot com and that's how you can coming in and see us for your one on one I'm also we do a lot of edge of the educational events throughout the year we do a lot of a specific Social Security events that's one of our most popular one but we do a lot of different topics and you can go to the events tab\nOn our website you'll see our calendar of different events that we do and and how to sign up for those as well so again that steps the white dot com\nThanks for joining us today on retire right at the white generally jak here alongside Dave ... and Brad white guy just about out of time on the show today so they have do you want the last word today and he found out this year\nI Do I and uh you know it's just this volatility that we've been experiencing recently\nYou know it's it's it you know I'll just say that uh the phone at Epstein and white that it really doesn't rain and and why is that ... you know I was when I say doesn't ring meaning panic people calling up what's the market doing today what do what do we do right you know folks that's the difference of having a plan and not having a plan\nAnd if like it's like going to lunch and I'll give you an example\nJim and Joe going to lunch\nGym sitting down and meeting his friend Joe Joe runs in health faced frightened scared and looking at what the market's doing today and uh and is is concerned and asked his his friend Jim you know are aren't you sharing the same worries I'm Sherry\nNo I'm I'm not I'm just looking at the menu here trying to figure out what I'm going out for lunch you know to what are you going to have I'm going to have the Ruben ... what are you going to have a job and what do you mean what am I going to argue freaking out the market's down eight ... well that's the difference Gen\nWe talk about this all the time and I I don't want to sound like a broken record but I Can't help it because it's thirty five years of experience and with that experience comes with them and I just know that the difference to\nA successful retirement okay and elevating and maximizing all that you've done not just getting getting through that when you like to know how to maximize all that you've done in in in getting ready for retirement and that's what we help people do here by the first thing that we do is build this plan\nWe build your retirement blueprint and we help people retire every day and so this is also I Want to say that no embarrassment zone to that you feel like you've you might not have made all the best decisions along the way well don't feel like the Lone Ranger a lot of people feel that way\nYou know this is not an easy thing getting ready for retirement and let them let that cause you to procrastinate because there's so many what you think are unknowns well this is what we do here to have seen why every day and this is our profession\nIs helping you retire right I Want you to get it right and then once you get it right the first time and so there's so much to know you know there's so many ways you can take Social Security\nAnd because of that there's so many ways you can mess it up there so much bad advice out there on on how to take it and and we don't want that to be you and so from Social Security to gossiping tax efficient so many people are not tax efficient\nAnd if you could be tax efficient by\nJust a few percentage points each and every year it literally means tens of thousands of more dollars over a twenty thirty your retirement and maybe a lot more than that\nAnd the risk that you know many people take you know a ... as they're as they approach a retirement when paycheck stop we have to really have this planned built so we know the returns that we need in order to have a successful retirement so we're not exposing ourselves and our our rest of our life money\nTo twenty five thirty five percent down side when that that might occur and markets go up and markets go down nobody knows when we don't know nobody nobody does\nAnd so you have to have a plant built in such a way to take advantage when the market is good and know where that money sits inside your plan\nAnd no money that you need now to give you current income at money needs to be safe and liquid not subject to volatility my folks there's just a lot to know and I just want to open the door as wide\nAs I possibly can and make it as easy for you to get what I Know is super super important is to get your blueprint\nTo your retirement built and built by a fiduciary who specializes in retirement income plenty to do that for you and that's upstanding way hell to the highest of all standards\nIn the advisory community to do what's in your best interests at all time do you want anything less than that\nSo the invite is here it's real simple leave your checkbook at home are real nice person is going to take your name and number and I'm going to call you on Monday and Tuesday introduce the for him to you and and have you pick a day that's best for you and I'll tell you what you should bring to make sure the time we spend together is the most meaningful to you [noise]\nOh you have to sit around for a bus that maybe comes once every three hours and you know again it was just like this kind of disdain for public transportation but they are talking about you know like how difficult\nIt is and how bad things can be here and there solution I suppose is to not this is like the one to ever and that and it's not going to get better\nAnd that was what was yeah I mean the I think a lot of transit advocates would gladly acknowledge that there's a there's two infrequent buses\nThere's not enough stops there's not enough alternatives it's too hard to get around during the day but that's part of what their point is is like look\nYou know ... we were concerned about your heels and your nails sure your hair your hair yeah but you know ... there's a lot of people that can't afford a car can afford all those things need to get around as well they need to do these jobs workforce housing issues and stuff but\nYeah it's amazing how like um there's so many things that\nPeople on both sides agree on what this issue so everyone's like yeah the roads are bad and we need money to fix them everybody agrees on that it's only like where the money should come from the TSA disagreement yeah and it's the same with public transit like yes buses should come more frequently and it should be easier to use the trolley\nUm I don't I don't know how to fix Diane Harkey hair I'm not sure about that one but like again the disagreement is just about how we should fund these things or what sort of prioritization we should be giving to them\nYeah and so then it brings question of like there's no argument about the gas tax it's like you have to write transit now there are some ambitious plans adopted by the city by the Republican there by the way to you know actually courage and try to get a certain number of people to take street or to take a alternate transportation\nNow I'm One of the things that's interesting about this though is that from the left the concern about the gas tax is that it funds to many highways and not enough transit right\nAnd in ... like that it's that these plans that are built that these are that this is funding is too heavily streets in car focused\nYeah and it's not just with the gas tax but it's like sort of the same argument we've seen play out with all these various plans that address\nHow we get around you know the sandbag master plan there were lawsuits about weather front loaded too many roads projects and that's been tied up in court and so any time we're having these discussions that always comes down to the\nThis matter of priority\nThink it's important to remember too that there isn't actually like a set of projects that's gas tax project yeah exactly no matter what either side wants to tell you you get one of those mailers and say like this or this or aren't going to happen like that's not really the case but it's also not the case that they will happen without it you know like the\nThe so there are a bunch of transportation these all these places like San Diego lay out their needs and their plan and the gas tax is just another source of money among the two or three or four needed to\nNo right so like a locally there's highway projects and there's\nI Know that there's one big effort to increase the frequency of buses downtown and there's a few other things that like need money yeah or maybe half filled or three quarters filled and the gas things would help them get farther if there's no gas tax it's not like that they'll fall off the plans they just won't get done\nYeah similar with you know trans man measure which didn't pass yeah I think MPs is looking to at\nPossibly flood its own tax and they would all ostensibly go toward a lot of the same projects that everybody agrees we need that shift that eat anytime you have these massive infrastructure projects you cobble together like ten different sources the funding to get them done\nRight they were also a railing on that project and he wrote about about the\nThe sand I wanted to do a headquarters down around now they need a place to park all the buses that go downtown and then there's all these port a potties out\nAnd people in the bus drivers go to the port a potty feel like all you need 'em all in one place if we're gonna make them all in one place might as well put our headquarters there and that project or ... you know there's a lot of bipartisan support for it but there's a lot of concern about they're using eminent domain to get the land\n[laughter] but um uh but they took they weaponize that argument as well right yeah [noise] All right so that was one of the Californians of the day this was a let's go to the second one\nYear [noise]\nRon Roberts who who are not going quietly into\nThe good of in a political career\nCounty supervisor run Roberts is the last few months of his term is county supervisor\nAnd there's obviously a big race to replace him between Nathan Fletcher and Bonnie Newman is last week John Brady who helps run the homeless choir voices varsity choir you might remember them from political test they opened up Darrell Steinberg sing and dance with him did you see\nThis yeah oh there's like a joyful moment yeah he was he's just a likeable person involved in this great effort\nYeah he was like a a snapping his fingers and dancing to lean on me so a genre I met him he was there he helped coordinate the choir so he gets up and he talks about supporting or one of these projects the county was going for it and then he he says look I just also want to say\nThat the county should do more for homelessness a it shouldn't rest on these cities including the city of San Diego and uh you know a few other things like that and supervisor on Robert wanted to work with him yeah\nIt is unfair to shoulder the responsibility so heavily on the city of San Diego and as mayor Kevin Costner thank you for your time\nAnd I respond to that I'm ready to jump out of my seat because that is fair baloney\nBeer baloney oh Pierre baloney gets\nThe bed so he was like you kind of caught off guard right so they so Robert goes into this like you know in passionate thing about how much money how many projects and all these things that the county's doesn't disturb homelessness yeah and then uh the guy's like oh hey look I didn't mean to tack you right\nI mean you did say like you know you should do more and there's this big crisis it's not that he wasn't it wasn't a pointed to criticize it was like the cities are doing a lot you need to do more\nYeah but also you know since we only heard the tail end of what he was saying I I just want to put out first this guy was formerly homeless himself he now runs a group of people who are currently homeless and formerly homeless this well he was speaking on world homelessness day\nAnd he was also speaking at like a county supervisors public comment you know a forum designed for precisely these types of issues and concerns yet to be brought forth in front of the supervisors and he did it and an incredibly measured and polite way\nWho was fully prepared now on the measure of like the spectrum of public comments and how he's at these public meetings and the level of vitriol that they can have there's like\nThere's like you know chamber of commerce you know prepared statement by the leader of the chamber and then on the other hand there's some real crazy things that happen so he is like like maybe a step removed\nFrom the chamber of commerce like a threat to point one yeah not at all [laughter] nowhere near tin Robert ... takes it to the left and right away for sure and here's more\nIncreased our homeless for teams that are out there is our emergency response team psychological ... that I'm not I was like listen to me sorry because you made a statement that shows I'll listen to the tweets that are coming out of some of the mayor's that have no idea what this board is stored I'm tired of hearing it\nTired man he is tired of hearing the tweets [laughter]\nSee the ... so he's referring to literally lose bone nine criticism yeah ever level between these two agencies right America Kevin Costner or the other day must have decided like\nWe need to county yeah Fifteen months to decide we need to county were doing all this\nWork on homelessness they need to step it up do more work on homelessness right yeah so they do at the classic Kevin Faulkner city of San Diego ... off his way\nIt's like tweet storm and it's like five tweets and the the ...\nThe top of the the sort of crescendo is is this one this this real\nBurned down the barn fire me of it we just like the city is doing with\nHomelessness the county must all caps must take a\nDifferent approach with mental health [laughter] take different approaches that is fire [laughter] I didn't score it China I get I really look at it a good hourly look at this ... is fired now getting remember this is like this is number like\nSeven eight of a of a\nTweet storm in which most of it is like the county is great the county's been doing good work\nThere are people at the county who care and are working to make a difference on mental health I Know that my work with them I respect them I could not have [laughter]\nPut the fancy feathers around this in a more ... it could not have gone more benign and yet it still Roberts is just fire mad about it yeah I Can't hear sweets anymore [laughter]\nForeign director of the homeless Claire is just like the straw that broke the camel's back you know with a a similar on the ... thing and then the poor guy like apologizing for being\n... and ... and you also can't hear it and the tweets he's like well wagging his finger really fiercely John Roberts yeah which is like a gross\nHe's currently on death row\nFrom the tragedy grew an effort to teach children about personal safety\nJonathan's mother and father started a foundation dedicated to their son and his best friend Charlie its goal is to educate kids about the dangers that exist in the world through a safety presentation using a story written by Jonathan's mother called always fly away\nMolina sellers joins us on community connection to share her story and tell us about the work of the foundation the website J. F. C. K. dot org J. F. C. K. dot org\nMolina you know thank you for being here thank you so much for having me I really appreciate than I'm from the south bay I remember Nineteen Ninety three I remember march of Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd I remember seeing you you know all over the news and today twenty five years later it's about child safety first before we started asking me questions I just want to ask you this how are you you know how are you today\nToday I continue to take it one day at a time and I'm focusing on\nThe good what we can do um to make it a positive thing I don't want my son and Charlie's murder to just be in vain and I don't want people to think of them and just cry and it's just negative\nThere is a reason that God allowed this to happen and so I feel that he has empowered me\nTo go and help save other children\nDoes it by teaching them just a very simple and basic less than\nTwenty five years later you're still you know changing the world you know changing you know the way you know what is out there in teaching children how to be safe through that book which we will get you in a few seconds but can you tell me about Jonathan\nJonathan oh my goodness he was so beautiful Jonathan has the most beautiful eyes and actually the book but one of the things that I had the artists draw the birds Stella I said I Want Jonathan's eyes and they're just these big beautiful happy full of life\nKnives and those warm\nWonderful wet kisses that he would always give and he was always laughing and he'd love to eat and it was as bad that you love and some food and basketball right on his favorite sport he was just\nJonathan was a peacemaker just loving 'em he knew the rules he always try to abide by the rules he was very very helpful sometimes as friends of parrots would save a little too helpful [laughter] but he was just a happy young boy\nNow I'm telling about Charlie Charlie Cheever and his family houses mom doing\nMurray is doing okay she's been going through some health issues is has been very stressful um the the last twenty five years is that been easy um and the first\nTen years of course eight years not knowing who the killer was not knowing who could have done this do they live right next door I'm\nMaria was so fabulous she went undercover Maria was out there talking to people she was just called the ... ... she was extremely upset of course like all of us but she was able to take that anger\nAnd do something you know she physically went out to the river bottom since she's talking to the homeless people and she wants to know have you seen anything if you know this is my son did you see anybody with him and all that kind of stuff I'm Maria was so extremely extremely and ball\nAnd that was then that was then and then you know what's so interesting is that after they found the killer and we went through the trial again which was just extremely difficult um\nIt's like there was no nothing else to fight for ... for her it was so hard um but then for me it's like that when\nWhen I woke up [laughter] that's what I ... [laughter] I mean if if I'm not mistaken I Know everything says Charlie was Jonathan's best friend but that's not really true it was all in your other son's best friend that's right I don't tell me about that\nOkay Charlie and ... they were in the same grade they were in the same classroom they were both Thirteen Years old and they were always together playing 'em and just\nGood buddies and Charlie was the kid that had everything and I I have three boys three girls you know six children and um so I couldn't afford to get a lot of toys and things were Charlie was\nThe only Child Left at home his brother and sister were older and they were already married and left and so he had all the wonderful toys he had a swimming pool so of course he was a house that everybody wanted to hang out at so him in ... and they just loved each other they rolled their bikes together they was just\nThey were ... you know they just love being together um but this particular day when Charlie came over\nOut and had a concert that day he plays the violin and he had a concert so he wasn't home\nAnd so he came and asked if John and think come out\nAnd So Jonathan did and um\n[noise] so it's really to this day it's extremely difficult for outing because he still blames himself thinking if maybe if he was there\nBut not understanding that he was just a kid and the the killer was a serial killer you didn't just kill our boys he killed a grown woman that they have the DNA to prove it in Florida he's done so much so many heinous crimes that and we don't want to say we don't know I don't I don't want to even give them that\nUm he did so many horrible things that I don't believe it if it was out in and Charlie I don't believe the outcome would have been any different than because he was a sociopath very very clever\nAnd which is again why I wrote this book and he refuses Murray has been to San Quentin um he's on death row and she's been there twice trying to speak to him but he refuses to speak to her\nMay I ask why she wants to\nShe wants to know exactly what happened she wants to know how he got the boys what did he say she wants to know what was you know what was Charlie last words and what are your thoughts about that\nI couldn't handle it I don't I don't want to know there's nothing he can tell me I there there's nothing he could say to me um it would be nice to know how he got the boys just fry could help other kids but as far as I couldn't I couldn't emotionally handle hearing anything more\nI Know my son and I know he was scared and I know Charlie was scared and and it kills me to this day when I think about it that Charlie Thirteen Years old the police believe that Jonathan was killed first it kills me to think that Charlie had watched Jonathan die and then knowing so it just ... oh\nYou know I'm you know you Molina and Maria remind me of Kelly and Kerry Kerry Kerry mcgonigle yes and Kelly King you know I'm Chelsea king never dubois\nBecause you know Kelly God Bless her she uh she's she's quiet about it and to herself about it you know but Kerry cameras mom she went to see the guy yeah and and talk to him and said please tell me you know tell me what happened and and it it you know [noise]\nI just I just I just have so much a you know love for\nAll four of you because there is a connection you guys are you all know each other\nWe are all sisters we're in the elite very special club that no one wants to be in but we were forced and by the same token\nYeah and you are are doing great things now you know we're going to get you know talking about more of that but always fly away [laughter] I Want to know about that I mean obviously we know why you're doing it for child safety but when did you say you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna\nDo a book I'm going to write a book where before you read it a little bit I Want to say this you know my name's Tommy salon and this is community connection and and my guess is Molina sellers thank you thank you so tell us about that but\nOK well with the foundation that Jonathan sellers Charlie keeper foundation we wanted to teach to educate children on ways of being safe\nAnd so we wrote it out as a way of acting it out mhm you know for the kids were costumes and everything to help them to remember it and in the process of doing that we knew I always knew that it was going to also be a book something they could actually take home with them and be tangible and they can actually read it themselves um\nSo that's a that's a children's book that I see like a teacher reading to their kids at a class right exactly yeah can you uh can you read that book I certainly can I be honored thank you\nAlways fly away a children's safety book\nBy Molina sellers Phillips with Deborah Dorn illustrated by Katherine Johnson\nIt's such a fine day at the end of the week and I would really like to play by the creek but my mom doesn't want me to go alone so I called my best friend who answered the phone my friend says the creek is a great place to meet so I kissed mom goodbye and she hands me a treat\nAs I leave home I hear my mom's say Stella remember when you don't know what to do always fly away\nI fly out the window and saw down the lane my wings or stretch far I fly fast as a plane I'm sailing and drifting around curbing round in it so much fun I Wish this day would never in\nAt the creek I look right and left but no one is there alone by the creek I wait but I'm getting scared where is my friend my buddy my pal he said he'd meet me but where is he now", "year":
