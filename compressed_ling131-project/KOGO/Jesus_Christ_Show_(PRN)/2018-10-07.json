you don't have to talk to another living soul\nBut those traditions were not just the lack of technology they were the importance built upon the importance of merchant ship and interacting with one another and being citizens\nAnd when it comes to God when it comes to scripture and the things of God\nThe traditions that are passed down and I know that there's some of the butt heads with one another on the different traditions that there are that are out there and some are good and some are bad some can actually be like a mill stone and weights you down your faith because you forget that

had no musical instruments that were amplified\n\nHe told me that he spoke with the pastor of the church and he said uh I I noticed that you didn't have any you know any instruments that were amplified Romney electric guitars or anything and he said that's not how it was the original church\nSo I don't want to hear at my church\nSo in effect he was saying that is not the tradition\nTherefore I don't want that year\nMy producer tells me that he looked at the Pasteur and replied then why do you use the microphone\n\nYou see there is some traditions that that you may hold onto that may not have a purpose you think they might what'd you hold on to him for the mere fact that their tradition and that is of no benefit to anyone and it certainly is not a benefit to the church\nIf you're new to this program you must know one thing the importance and the purpose of this program is ... Palin perpetuate the ideas\nOf Christianity however are desires to do it in a way that's different because the traditions don't always work\nThe traditional way of doing things don't always compel and sometimes get look archaic get left behind and that's not to say that you take scissors to scripture and take out what you don't like or just say well that was then this is now that's not what I'm saying\nWhat I'm saying is understand the purpose of traditions\nIf you remember and you can read this in March seven I was constantly being poked at prodded tested by the religious leaders of my day two thousand years ago\nWhere I went somebody was trying to corner me to get me to\nTo to make some statements some contradictory statements something that we've caused an uproar either in the Roman community\n\nOr in the Jewish community\nAnd a lot of the things that were asked of me and a lot of lot of the opportunities that were taken were really based on tradition\nWhat do you think of this tradition what do you think of that tradition and in March seven you can read in the first one that the fairest these and also at the time some of the scribes were coming together and they were focused on me as they started to gather around me\n\nThey had some questions as there and wants to do and one of these\nQuestions and to do with why might disciples were eating their bread with impure hands\nNo ... not to get totally into what impure hands deal with I mean there was a ceremonial washing that would take place with a handful of water especially if you just came from the marketplace\nAnd that you might be mixing with things unclean\nMaybe gentile things money pencils\nAny of those things the tradition was to wash your hands now are Jewish brothers and sisters if you go back into a lot of their ceremonial in traditional laws you'll find that they were way ahead of their time\nAs far as hygiene and a intellectually being able to understand the importance of cleanliness\nSeparating where you eat versus uh where you could waste\nVery smart the fair season this situation however we're not seeing if you could imagine the balance named port east and the difference between the tradition of cleaning your hands and the important the necessity of eating\nAnd sometimes unfortunately I find that to be the same in the body of Christ\nYou you focus on these traditions and sometimes you're so focused on the tradition you're still lost in those those things of all that you can't move forward that you'd rather not eat at all and die\n\nSpiritually because of the tradition of the cleansing of the hands\n\nAnd you don't understand the way the importance and the balance between the two should always ... yes having clean hands is important when you

think my parents church my mother's eighty three and my dad's eighty six\nAnd so I have to take a boat every Sunday which I don't mind um but one day I was it that you're home with his church and the

happened\nWhat's your thought on this fellow shipping people\nI I certainly don't speak to the theology or the structure of the job was witness belief system is not the belief system of uh this radio program or orange producers\nSo um and not one that this program or it's radio producers would um [noise] recommend so having said that they have their own system\nIn which they adhere to their own system in which uh they teach and they control the structure of their church body\nIt doesn't mean that others don't or even solar system you can be excommunicated from ...\nAnd uh there are other church Protestants in uh in nature that would ask somebody to leave the church it's contingent upon what the structure and the rules of that particular church are\nAnd um how they feel text you know execute them in the the process of teaching so it's up to them it's it's their world\nAnd a war of their new world is the case may be but it's their world and they can make their a structure any way they they wish there is a time and there is scriptural references when\nPeople were ostracized or allowed to go or asked to go um to get clarity in their life before they come back and bring 'em doubt or ugliness or bitterness into the church and I think it's a although I may not agree with the reasons they're doing it for or\nThe way they're doing it I think sometimes you\nThere's wounds that you'll mend and there's ones that you amputate in life otherwise known amputate them they make the whole body sick and I think that the uh ... you and I may not agree with the reasons they did it but the premise is still a legitimate one that is sometimes you have to protect the many from the one\nI understand by the way my mother loves your show too [laughter]\nWell that's nice to hear the show

of view and where we come from so that people don't get confused\nAnd there is a we try and focus on the things that we agree on a minute things we disagree on 'em but the truth of the matter is that ah\nWhen someone is excommunicated from a church the church has that right based on whatever their structure is as long as everybody knows that going into it than they're signing off on that saying okay I won't do that or I won't partake in those things where I won't be a part of that or bring the end of the church\nOr the kingdom hall or whatever it is and in that\nUh agreement\nUh you're allowing the church to discipline even way they see fit\nAnd that is okay I wouldn't always agree there are many ah groups churches that X communicator kick people out for reasons I think our asinine

any place in the Bible\nWhere I can go to get some guy tried it you know\nWell sure specifically no there's nothing specific about pi TST now I Would say what what is it that you're\nA physician or why do they think that you have this because this was because of an illness\nOh I think it's all it's not like I Am\nA lark through [laughter] I Know ... for me I'm just waiting for him to tell me what that is [noise] well I don't know I guess I don't know why am I think that dreams and why it would be\nMy you'll go wild dreams ah dreams play many parts in scripture and sometimes a dream is a dream and most often people trains see dreams as liberal but the most common theory and and one of the best theories is if\nYou imagined a mirror a big mirror that ah was reflecting when you're bedrooms let's say in your home\nAnd you could see everything to know that states your bedroom it's got the clock on the table lamp that beautiful lamp that you love so much you can see your bed the window with\nAh kids playing on the outside in the tree and a bird and all these things in that mirror and then if you went and you broke that mirror\nAnd the twisted pieces now would shift their perspective\nAnd now a there'd be a maybe you would just see the bird instead of the kids playing outside the window\nAnd now the lamp would be just above the bird so it would look as if the the lamp was on top of the bird's head and all these things are a distorted view something that you already know or things that are in your life on a day to day basis or or in your heart or your head\nSo a a dream ... often is is very disjointed\nAnd that's why when you wake up and you try to piece it together\nUm you're saying while I was in my house but it wasn't my house but I knew it was my house but it didn't look anything like my house and you start doing those things 'cause you're starting to try and reconstruct something that is torn apart that it is it's all piecemeal and and it can be confusing\nSo I wouldn't take that that dream per se\nUm as liberal as much as it is that yes you had a traumatic experience and you thought probably a lot about death and what that would have been like\nAnd what being absent from the body or being absent from this world would be like it also made you think about those that you cared about an end or knew that had moved on before you and that comes together in a dream um that can be a little creepy\nAnd sad and those types of things so I don't know that you're going to pull direct meaning out of it\nBut I Will say this throughout scriptural though it doesn't speak specifically\nTo Pete TST and keep in mind be TST it's thrown around a lot there's very different forms and for different reasons um there's those that come back from combat in the military and that's a very specific and different kinds of but there's those that that get it from watching someone they care about passing away or\nIn your case you going through something physically um draining that was scary and potentially life threatening\nAnd you go through all those things and they cause you to wonder about your stability it's like\nYou live every day with the stability it's it's it's like if you could feel the earth move how unsettling that would be um you know think about it so it it's not it's moving all the time and there's things like that that you\nKind of ignore to get through life and when you're faced with them it can shake your foundation and make you quite nervous I Will say that there are scriptures that talk about comfort\nAnd talk about the process of comfort second Corinthians won three through five and it's a little interesting the way it's worded so I asked you to hear it in its fullness it says praise be to God and father and father of our Lord Jesus Christ\nThe father of compassion and the God of all comfort comforts us in our troubles so that we can come for those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves to receive from God\nFor justice we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ so also our\nComfort of bounds through Christ now the word comfort is you so much there it gets kind of tied up in all of it but when you see it laid out it's talking about the compassion of the father\nThe the God of all comfort every comfort comes from God the piece of life that you enjoy the things the stability in your life Debbie come from God\nSo it talks about God being the author of all of that comfort goes on to say not only is the author of comfort but God actively comfort you and your troubles why so that you also can comfort\nOthers in trouble with what with the comfort that you received from God\nBut first five is interesting because it doesn't say if there is no ifs here there's no maybe it says for just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ\nNot if you have sufferings like rice or any of that it's for just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ so also our comfort of bounds through Christ\nAnd really focusing on God and letting God you're stability because the world is not stable\nThere are sharp corners to it there are scary things to happen they're scary people scary circumstances and they're ugly things are accidents are ugly things that happen and if you focus on those things if you define yourself by that moment\nIf you find yourself by the things that have happened to you\nThen yes that will build up inside you and that will become your focus if you focus on God the unchanging creator of all creation and the\nAuthor and distributor of comfort and you use what comfort you received the comfort of others to the best of your ability that's which are called to do right now that's what God wants you to do\nIt or to just about every day I woke up out of a light apart and\nIt will be much joy when I get that you might I might might not falling back\nWhen I start all over again\nAt a girl that's exactly right so a is there a way for you to donate your time or just spend time with others that might be in pain or going there so I had\nThat I thought that'd be accurate and I walked through the parks down on Skid Row their ...\nAnd I've never been able to talk about God or anything like that all my life or a couple of years ago and\nI and I find myself talking to them about him now and their problem when I get home it makes me feel better and I and I know he dragged me to do that and it got bad now ... and I can't get out of it [laughter]\nUh well I beg to differ I think you sound great\nAnd I will tell you there is and again there's different types types just be TST and I know when people get confused we're talking specifically about what you're going through\nAnd I will say this but there's an element to it that no one else can give you in any way shape or form or speed up and that is the element of time\nSo that is going to be a huge part in his Debbie for you is time it's going to play a part but everything you're doing and everything you tell me you're doing is right on the money\nYou keep going down that path because that is the pass the God has you want and that will be the past year peace\n[noise]\nAnd you walk through life you go through life going I Believe this is the way things are going to work you walk through life believing that your wife or your husband when they say they're going to love you and be with you forever they're going to do that\n\nYour children believe when you say you're going to protect them that you're going to do that\nThat everything's going to be okay that everything is going to be okay but the reality is that is not the way things work\nAnd there are problems and there's pain and their allies and there are accidents\nAnd things happen and if you bank on the world always being okay\nAnd if you expect there's never going to be any problems you're going to be surprised and your world will get rocked but if you trust in God that does not move that is always the same that is where the true stability in life comes from\n\nShow will return in a moment\nOf a show called\nBack Supreme Court nominee now justice Brett Kavanaugh one involving an intern of the office
