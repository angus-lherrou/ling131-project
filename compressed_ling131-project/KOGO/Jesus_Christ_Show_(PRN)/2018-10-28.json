Fox News I'm devastated\nEven well articulated groups of Christians that just ... things out and say this is why this is what we do but not why we do it and that becomes confusing to non believers\n\nLike many things that surrounds your life in this world in your face\nWhen it comes to Halloween there's some controversy\nBut is this controversy this\nParticular day this particular celebration\nIs it in fact necessary\nOr the roots of Halloween found in paganism\nYep absolutely no doubt about it\nDoes this automatically mean that Christian that a Christian can't partake in any part of a Halloween celebration of course not I know there will continue to be disagreements but what is based on fear of an ignorance\nVersus the reality\nThat's what's important 'cause the more you do something just based on fear and ignorance\nThe the less substantive your face looks like to others\nAnd you may feel well I don't care what it looks like to them\n\nAnd if so you should be ashamed to yourself assume it's important for those around you that are non believers to it for you when they are around you to give them the best idea you can of what you believe and why you believe it\n\nTo give them that hope or maybe understanding in a way that they all want to ask questions or investigate on their own\n\nMost historians believe Halloween originated with the ancient Celtic festival of selling its also pronounce sub van or champagne and it means the end of summer during this festival people would like these huge communal bonfires\nAnd yeah they were costumes mostly comprised of animal heads and for hours and they did this to ward off roaming spirits and goes\nThat's kind of the basic element of what Halloween was in one sense or another kind of the ...\nWhen the\nWhen the ... century finally rolled around pope Gregory this third designated November first as something called all saints day\nThis was a\nWas a time to honor saints and martyrs that had passed dawn\nYou can't look at that as a bad thing centrally honoring those in the Christian family that had done good\nAnd we're no longer on this earth\n\nWell is often is the case this particular this new holiday incorporated many of the traditions of the ... festival so a lot of the things the\nKind of the ... that were already are being used to celebrate in sound when\nWe're now kind of attached to this all saints day you can kind\nOf think of it this way it's much easier to paint an old building and put up a new sign in the news to to tear down the whole building and start from scratch\nAnd this was nothing new it had been done many times before for instance many pagan customs were combined with Christianity when Constantine went through the big conversion his was a slow conversion but when he latched onto it sometime around his forties\n\nHe converted the official pagan religion of the Roman empire to Christianity as was between three twenty and three thirty AD ... little things came in and found their way home to Christianity that had a beginning in paganism\n\nSo back to a all saints day\nThe evening before all saints day was a known is all Hallows eve and this is you can figure out later became Halloween\nBut over the centuries\nThis this data is Halloween has evolved and continues to evolve and continues to change and now it's moved into this is secular and\nIncredibly commercial I mean right behind Christmas commercial\nGo go out to a market or something today and you'll see just how commercial it is and it continues to get larger and larger each year and this Halloween becomes massive so over the centuries it continues to evolve it becomes secular incredibly commercial and really it's the celebration\nThat is embraced by communities many communities as more of a you know child centric holiday because of its activities like trick or treating or decorating your home look spooky really focuses on\nChildren and their desire to be creative or play make believe we're dress up for these types of things\n\nAnd I know that this becomes controversial because of its origin and there's a battle within the church as to what to do now is first and foremost thing that should be thought of is safety always\nIf you're if you don't feel safe in your neighborhood or you don't feel safe at certain things there's all kinds of alternative things to do your community community does other things that are are more controlled that's great even churches do\n\nBut just shy away from it because of its origins doesn't necessarily um a point to balance thinking in the church and it's not that your children should be running around\nI'm dressed as mayhem and the devil and all these things there there are middle grounds that you could do where you can partake in certain aspects of it\nAnd it can be enjoyed\nNot abused anyway because the truth of the matter is with healthy parent parental involvement Halloween can be fun\nAnd creative time for children\n\nI assure you and if you're worried about their involvement kids aren't parsing the\nMultifaceted theological underpinnings of the possibility of antecedent pagan genesis I assure you\nThey just want to play dress up and get free sweets\nThat's it [noise]\nOh yeah\nThis is where God's concern has\nThere isn't a commandment about you should not dressed up in fun and make believe or you shall not receive sweets from the hand of a neighbor or anything like that\n\nOh I'm sure that somebody would like to twist scripture defines something like that but that's not the case\n\nIt's really about

mistake or this\nIs not and apologetic for Halloween or pagan activities\nIt's a defense of reason and discernment\nAnd as a Christian using those tools or to find a balanced approach to the things that surround you in this life you are in this world\nYou were in it by choice of God\nAnd there is a lot a lot of Christians who won from every thing because of origins and I'm going to show you why that might not be as easy as you think\nAnd every year I get calls in tweets and emails about Halloween and yes it is I'll Wayne is rooted in paganism but that doesn't automatically mean Christian can't partake in it in some way or some fashion\n\nSo this Celtic festival of Sao in a later or through a pope Gregory the third designated November first it's all saints day so it's all around the same time this is to honor a saints and martyrs\nBut a lot of the traditions and ideas and certain other practices in from the ... festival made its way into that as well\nThe evening before\nOr this became a known as a all Hallows eve that became Halloween now you've got this very commercial secular\nNon pagan religiously anyways\nEvent and it's important to just realize that God's problem\nWith paganism or other belief systems\nIs not necessarily their practices but that they do those practices while worshipping another God altogether exodus twenty first three you show have no other God's before me let's say if the lord that as God's word that's the concern\nGod wants you to celebrate and glorify him and every thing you do\n... and has\nTo understand this a little better just keep in

genesis eight twenty and Twenty one and I'll read that than Noah built an altered to the lord\nAnd taking some of the clean animals including birds he sacrificed burnt offerings on it the lord smelled the pleasing aroma and set in his heart never again like curse the ground because of humans even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from\nChildhood and never again will lie destroy

of this is that those things that you're talking about have become comfortable to you because they've been passed down do you not because of their origins\nThere is not a matter of fact the early church didn't celebrate it in that sense and those are in those land on pagan holidays and\nWere usurped did both Easter and Christmas\nAnd a lot the ties into those things and the things that you celebrate really tightened a pagan beliefs the tree in the house the eggs and the bunny all of those things but it's what you do with him that matters not with from where they came from you came\nFrom

said wise men still follow him today with a picture of me on it to you know either on the cross or something like that and things like this ... you'd be surprised how much\nIt is it has infiltrated not on its own but willingly by different groups or a leaders like Constantine in the like\nUm that had shaved off as much of it is they could and then apply the others so that there was comfort level in its growth as a matter of fact Christianity can be argued by historians at least\nUm I might have a different talk but um that a lot of that is what propelled Christianity\nYou know Rome Constantine changing Roman and their national religion and belief system at first it was opening it up to all beliefs and it was ... okay listen you're not going to be persecuted for being Christian anymore that's the first day\nAnd then slowly\nOr he started opening that up and then he started saying well no paganism problem or going to start not just allowing everything but now putting paganism down and through the process of the years and so on chained to a point where he says no Christianity is mandatory\nIn ways and then you've got people going okay well\nThen I'm just can take this with me or this with me or this with me doesn't always work absolutely not or their systems that how our polluted in perverted because they brought things into Christianity absolutely\nBut that's where discernment comes from and my purpose for bringing these things up and pointing them out is or even the word holy day um has been muted to holiday and their or things like blessings and the term holy itself that really ... very far back\nPre dating Christianity and the if you start just throwing the baby out with the bath water you have problems the bath water is dirty the baby babies clean and you need to look around and see how these things\nAre are interacting in your life if they are neutral or can be neutralized then that's fine\nThey're infiltrating by way of someone with an agenda or something or these types of things than yes you are to defend yourself and your faith or against those kinds of interruptions but many of these things from thousands of years\nFiltering have become benign\n\nYou know uh you ... the the the practices that these things once held have nothing to do with it a child is not running around in a costume of their favorite superhero thinking that they are ordering off demons and spirits and ghosts as they dance around a bonfire\n\nIt's simply them trying to get candy and dressing up\nWhen it says in scripture that you were created in the image of God some argue that that is that you have intellect will in motion others would say that you're very creativity of a desire to be creative or create and build in any way shape or form is antithetical to the devil himself who wishes to destroy\n\nSo when you find children having a desire to create or be creative is something that should be encouraged\nOthers will look at Halloween and the concept of death and mayhem and say oh well it deals with the death or death or a skeletons and I've always appreciated the the the look of our brothers and sisters that\nHave cultures rooted in a in Mexico and their uh their understanding or they're at peace\nWith the concept of death and they celebrate the day of the dead not as something that worships the dead but as something it's kind of like all saints day where it's time to look back on the those from your family that have passed on and to celebrate their life\nBut it's done with him injuries are the imagery is goals and you know people get confused what is about and it's it looks I'm dark and sinister and really it's not it's a it's about life\nEven the place where I died ... is the place of the skull Christians are taught not just here he who can kill the flesh but he can kill the spirit or both\n\nAnd so that that the concept of combating a the fear\nOf death is a scriptural one\nI walked through the belly of the shadow of death is your fear no evil\n\nAnd that kind of attitude is can be healthy and productive now as an adult you need to have discernment in all things and apply it to your life in the life of your children absolutely\nAnd find where that line is for you and how you would want to practice or something like this but I Will tell you that when you\nWhen you\nKind of sequester a child from something that's going on in the world and it's not explained properly or it's just well that has demonic roots a kid doesn't even know what a pagan is or any of those things\nThen you end up cutting off a much more than you think you are because an environmentalist I'm yes on one side you can say I'm being good Stuart with the world the God has given but on the other side\nEarly pagan Z worshipping and taking care of the world\nSo is it about taking care of the world that's good or bad or is it about while you're taking care of the world and to who that glory goes these are the things that I think our last in these battles of well it's just bad or it's just good God is just good\nAnd there are a lot of Christian liberties and a lot of battling that went on and and the church of ... and\n... should I eat this if it was the given the idols or a sacrifice to idols to do this and in many cases it's like eat what you want if you're glorifies God you're fine\nAnd then on some cases if there's somebody who's going to stumble by the very fact that you're doing that you don't want to cause the lesser minded as scripture says are those that no less um to fall\nBut you also want to educate them in educating them then they won't stumble on the smaller stones\nThey'll see the bigger picture\nAnd that's my only hope here it's not to champion a particular holiday or to tear another holiday down it's to be reasonable\nOr partially because if when you're reasonable others will see you're reasonable and they'll believe what you say about your faith and about God if they're non believers if you're unreasonable they will reject what you say and what you do in your belief in God [noise]\n[noise] patterns oh Mm\n\nHouse I mean you\nA a\nLot of Jesus Christ show will return in a moment\nA

Christian households yes but my parents let a celebrated and how long have you been worshipping the devil now\n\nIt it's it's not necessarily the way the path goes and you want to protect your children to the best of your ability but also keep in mind that if you're over sensitive on things that are benign or neutral or that you can um [noise] uh you can put an understanding\nOf Christianity on it then sometimes it confuses and causes great rebellion and that's not to say to be a lukewarm and wishy washy upbringing 'cause you don't want the kids rebel it's not my point\nPoint is that uh make sure that the things that you're trying to cut from their life that you make a good case for it and that it's understood across the board otherwise truly is they ah\nGet older and start doing their own ... search and seeing that there's all kinds of things in your home that have a pagan origin and customs and things like that then\nAnd then they'll start turning it back on you and\nOf course that will be a problem\nCharlie welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nHi Charlie how can I help you\nI um I had a question about I'm like how do I give\n'em glory to God and any um every day and voting\nAnd life like going to a movie with friends or mowing the grass or anything like that you know\nWell there's ... it really comes down to if you hear a a child talk about their parents and you asked that child will you know would you give your life or your parent\nThey'd say yes but you asked that same child if they'll mow the lawn\nOr do the dishes and they'll go oh I don't want to and Christians do this sometimes too it's like they you would lie lay down your life for your God if necessary but you won't live your life for God and that means every little boring thing\nYour parents don't want to be a you know you to get their foot every ten seconds going gosh you the greatest parents and the whole wide world I live ... they want you expressing that in the things that you do showing them that the life\nThey've given you will be a life that's productive\nAnd righteous and ah with filled with purpose and God wants the same thing yes God wants you to worshipping God once you in church God wants you to pray God wants you to do all those things that have become religious in nature but truly\nGod wants you to live a life I'm\nA vet is filled every single day we'd

incessant cough\nIt means always be in that state of knowing that God is there and that you're thinking about God and that's kind of what you do with everything and and if you partake in something Charlie where you feel like how can I bring got into this and it doesn't quite work than maybe that's something that you want to not do in your life\nYeah I'm ... yes\nI had a question about like what about like uh gone to the like scary movies I mean it doesn't affect me like I don't think it's bad but like it is it not giving it already God like if I were to go the scary movie\nWell it's what the purpose is there are many scary parts to scripture and I know that movie's depict or you know angels and demons as particular types of creatures but if you saw a good angel\nRaising credit scores and

peeves if you will is the concept of zero zero tolerance you see a lot in schools\nSo that a child that brings an aspirin to school is considered um as as big of a problem as someone who brings enlisted drugs or\nMarijuana or whatever it might be cocaine\nBut they're all drugs even though it's aspirin\nEveryone gets expelled\nSo that kind of concept of all or nothing that is it really points to laziness than it does anything else\nAnd if you're going to be lazy in your face and not use discernment then why\nDid got put you here and give you the tools like scripture and prayer and a steak things like there's wisdom in a multitude of counsel so the people around you to get insight if you're just supposed to go okay not doing this ever\nOr they're not doing this ever type things sure

don't just cut it out now I have to read scripture and really understand things and know whether um this is right or wrong in this context and it just takes too much effort I'm just going to say

is what brought this to the surface oh yeah oh that breaks my heart to thought that something might as well [noise] [noise] okay\nI'm changing the thing is that she's in the vulgar and I'm a major church and we weren't all that made your church together and then said she made the decision that are divorced me and stuff it's a piece of\nThe church it seemed like back them up they kind of\nMake a statement the family's forever you know a lot of their teaching about family forever and eat out of the good part of the church for many years and and I haven't had any contact with these people and I and I I've tried to go back a couple of God I just didn't feel like I Want it kind of thing now so ...\nSo I got it feel bad about that and my wife and my youngest daughter still go but yeah see\nAnd the whole aspect of this too I mean a couple of years ago I I uh I got a double them all getting swine flu and I had died a couple of times on life support or ... yeah\nI think uh my goodness so you died a couple of times and ... and and this yeah this is did we speak before\nNo I don't think [noise]\nAh you you don't hear that often the whole died a couple of times now when when this occurred uh ... when this occurred ... this is a clinical death rate that they're just stopping in a heartbeat is what you're talking about\nRight yeah the first time it stopped for failing to that man that's a couple of days later the three that but\nMy goodness so when I'm On my ...\nAnd everything all that stuff [laughter]\nSo you've had your share of some some ugly time some very rough times and you're trying to work yourself through them now\nYeah that's that's exactly what that well\nYou're ... the thing that is about churches is their their community\nAnd unfortunately sometimes in that community um they don't always know how to deal\nWith everything we can just been running seen throughout the show and started with the concept of Halloween in paganism all these things and what you cut out of your life and what you don't sometimes the church\nReally doesn't know how to respond to certain\nUgly parts of life or the divorce and things like that or even the death of someone or strange circumstances or whatever it is\nAnd they just\nThey they don't run to the aid of and this was an all churches but some do and this may or may not be the church that you were attending\nA in the case but in that case as well but really um the important thing is for you to find a church to grow and to be rooted in regardless of whether it's that church you were originally in or not is there a\n... ... what is your goal in all of this what are you trying to trying to get the family back together or you're trying to make yourself whole again what is your goal\nTo the primary thing would be to to make myself whole again so I can get the family back together we are for children to so so we're ... we didn't just screw up their lives you know their friends all of our friends all over relatively liberal thirty one years\nBuilding up so it's a lot a lot of you know ... the crazy thing is that you know it is though\nThat I think there's some way could be a man that I just don't know how to get it all back together and you know it it with the long I think the long term plan but\nThey are and I just don't feel comfortable going back to that church right now and then they have it and you know like if they haven't reached out one diamond said hey you know how you doing you know it's like\nReally is it a large church very larger yeah that happens\nAt the very light and many many of them you know so be it the way that like I said there's\nA there's you know there is a factor the\nChurches that I've always been turned off about is hypocritical ... some people it's like it's okay you shouldn't do that than I should do this and listening to you ... you're saying that\nTo find a middle road because everything you do not always so that's a terrible thing you know just by watching you know a Halloween movie or something you know that's not like a year the devil worship or you're you're just joining a movie or something you\nKnow I find that the church uh likes the pendulum swing hard left or hard right and\nAnd that doesn't mean to be mediocre eh I say in scripture if you're lukewarm ... out of my mouth it's not not to be warm it's a matter of finding that balance gym it's a matter of saying okay well\nUh uh where is a place of health for me and something that will not distracted take me away from the gospel or my face and\nIn your circumstances a\nIn going through pain or a a divorce or any of these things can be quite distracting and God's desire is always for reconciliation possible if your wife's not here to talk um and speak for herself but I'd be I'd be curious to see\nA gym if your wife was on the phone and I asked her why you guys got a divorce what\nDo you think the top three reasons she would give\nA she would probably start off with a weed I have to\nHave a steady income during you know because ah yeah I had you know of all the yeah I was in the hospital for two weeks but you know a couple of years ago that they you know it took me two or three months to recuperate from that so okay what would be the second out there so that would be the financial aspects that I Would think it would be any ... any type of\nDrinking of alcohol whatsoever but but at the same time she she has a martyr either that there too and I'm not I'm a casual drinker but you know she thinks that that you know and I've never ever get on that a person that gets abusive or whatever you know but you know\nOkay I'll I'll let you go by these point by point your butt and then the third\n[noise] I Would say the relationship that I have with the uh for kids you know though all four kids are pretty much like ... and I hate to say this but on my side you know\nThey take their mom you know their their mother with is gone through about a ... you know for after doing all that that a positive stuff and everything\nShe did like a one eighty at one point I was you know I was actually trying to help her and her ... her things that she was doing and she got to be kind of a drain on the family money than\nThe ... yeah we we ... about the money and her sister ever paid it back in okay well we have a bunch of issues there you know a lot\nOf issues there and those going in a couple of different directions gym so I Would say the financial one me deal with something just a beyond finances have you always been kind of in and out of work I\nWell in a ... is the would you consider your home a Christian home yeah okay so you're both believers yeah okay and uh you say three or four years ago um did it like kind of a trickle out\nYeah can't do that I mean well you know we had our ups and downs in our relationships are like any couple does everything like that and then just trying to disappear and that never been able to ah I get\nThat part back I mean to get along great as friends we go out together we go on vacation together but the physical part has not exist\n[noise] and um you know what I Want to\nTalk to you more about this because I think it's it's it's a bigger issue than some people may think and the fact that you were so bold to call in and a lot of a lot of men wouldn't I'm In this case I really want to take a look at a couple of things and ask you some questions can you can you stick around\nFor a moment yeah okay hold on them when we come back last year more questions\n\nHome\nLike I'm ... now\nSee in\nJesus Christ church

every single Sunday right here as I answer your questions and talk about things that truly matter in life\nAnd the afterlife if you have a question or a dealing with the theology or you're going through something right now I'd love to talk to you or anywhere in the usa Dell eighty seven seven holy host\nUh for those view like plain and simple numerically it's eight seven seven for six five nine for six seven\nWe were talking with Scott Scott you're still with us yet you were saying that uh you've been married for ten years\nYeah about ten years okay and the past four or so um three or four years\nWith her for years your wife is slowly had less and less interest in sex and you say other than that the relationship is great you guys are you know go out to see movies you hang out together you go on vacations together but no sex\nRight has your wife prior um had any medical issues at all or changed medications or anything like that\nWell yeah I mean she's she's got some medications like comes to the things that ... and things of that nature which which should be intervening that she had some hormone ashes and sleep issues and so forth um that she'd never been a you know real\nSexual type of a creature um\nSo going into this marriage or when you guys were first married she wasn't even\nThere is terribly interested in sex or yeah\nShe she she was not a short in a while yet another lady at that\nWhy well oh okay [laughter] okay to cut that I that might be filed under a TMI maybe but I appreciate the inside um ...\nThe reason why ask these things is not a medical show of course we look at the spiritual aspects of things in from biblical in mainstream Christian a perspective but I asked to sing\nBecause all of that kind of points to the direction of um you know where one might look for answers in something like this now when it first started you say three or four years ago what would be the excuse or the response to\nUm uh you becoming amorous and I'm a approaching her sexually\nUh for her for her you know when she just shut you down cold I have a headache I've got to rearrange my sock drawer what what kind of risk I mean it\nJust it just about anything you know it would be you know uh [laughter] not feeling well or too much stress at work or those kind of thing\nOr even when we get ... ... Haitians or whatever it's into land on her cycle so to see those kinds of issues that she would come up with and you know we've been rebuilding our relationship are slowly so we've had some upside down then\nOkay well what what are those ups and downs when you say you're rebuilding what are you rebuilding what was torn down or broken\n... well I you know I have a sense from a previous marriage for this for a bit not a previous marriage but still find it and uh you know that caused a little bit of a different opinion\nA year ago I used to drink every pet it and I haven't drank in years stuff like that so there there there were some of the issues that\nWhat kind of drink or were you\nUh where do you mean drunk\nI'm sloppy\nSloppy okay an embarrassing drunk okay yeah yeah and it it did in that was done in front of her quite often\nUh yeah she she well when I did that at the same time you know she loves me and that turns out there and I went to care of that and she joined that supportive of that and you know that that issue certainly now that that to some time ago\nOkay and you know I'm In\nA reason why I bring that up though Scott so you know is that um sometimes are in relationships you get in different modes and let's say she you know of course she loves you you love her and she's in that mode of taking care of you when your sloppy drunk\nAnd it takes her energy and all of those things that sometimes the resentment builds up and then when you were well or your partner can become quite distant\nI'm Still working through those things when those memories or gosh remember this or that as they won start to learn new you and how the new you works and healthy works\nAnd all of those things and they can be resentful of well how come how come you didn't do it sooner or do you not care\nOh there's a lot of things the fiber of my ... uh um the illnesses let's put it that way the illnesses that you named to four or five of them actually um that might play a part or even hormones\nI'm specifically some of them deal with pain some of them do not this year for comment about a pain\nOh yeah yeah and and uh quite a bit I'm ... and so on [noise] but I don't think that that would necessarily the the the ring run behind it I guess my concern is you know I'm married\nBut her fiber miles yeah does that does that manifest itself\nIn pain yes okay and that's been since you didn't\nMess hall", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "28"}
