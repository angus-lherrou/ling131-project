costume to wear on Halloween one of their favorite days of the year those who wait until the last minute\nTake the risk there won't be any of the hottest get ups left but by or make a costume too early and physical kids change their minds are you the parent that will make the switch or force them to stick with the original here's Wall Street journal reporter Leslie Brodie luckily set this up\nSome parents think they're being really efficient and they buy a Halloween costumes or make them I'm In uh when they're on sale [noise] back in the summer but then they find their kids change their mind by the time Halloween rolls around but the parents who wait till the last minute sometimes worry that there won't be the exact way costume that their kid one left anymore [noise]\nAh so parents play at a ticket game of carrying out when to listen to too\nI'll desires cause they little kids change your mind all the time\nDid you figure out by the way like go on a which types of parents were the most likely to cave weight in October and scramble to get the change of mine costume\nNo I found like a pushover a and tough parents are of all stripes but one one really made me laugh when she said that um [noise] you know for her kids that that ... is what you're wearing it's like a marriage are committed you're going to need a lawyer or a body bag to get out of it\nThat was a whole area's quote I mean these days right it's not not the same or you just throw on some makeup or you know as you mentioned ... a white sheep back in the day and be a ghost immune it's you're spending money these days [laughter]\nWell the average according to the national Retail Federation is eighty seven dollars per person for Halloween celebration but that would also include cards and candy and costumes decorations\nAnd all it's about nine billion dollars across the country [noise] um and some parents and some kids to make their own cost himself to shut up for those who\nTake all the Amazon boxes and make them into dinosaurs [laughter]\nWith the is is there a particular range of age where the mine changing right before Halloween seems to be most popular\nWell a telephone Klein who's an expert in toddlers at Barnard College she she thinks the preschool years are particularly I'm full of surprises because he says that young children are left pretend and they live in the present they don't have the same sense of time or a ton of counter that adults do\nSo for her she said that they get a full clash between a young child world and a parent's world [laughter]\nBut her parents they can they can be shared and tensions and tricky and you know stressful\nThanks Leslie Wall Street journal reporter Leslie Brody it is seven minutes now in front of the hour on this weekend [noise]\n\nWill face plays a part in any word every belief system the fate of Christianity should be one that is preceded by recent\n\nScripture says that\nFaces the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen\n\nInterestingly enough that word evidence there it's translated as evidence means truly proof or proving\n\nAnd what kind of face I call you to have is one reason of understanding that doesn't mean that there are things that you can't know scripture says the secret things belonged to the lord but there are things that you can know should know and should pass on\n\nThree is a wonderful thing it is that which comes at the end of reason\n\nJohn's dot regs seeker so the faith is a reasoning trust you trust which reckons thoughtfully confidently upon the trustworthiness of God\nThere's nowhere in scripture where you will find God calling you to a blind face\nTo an unreasonable faith\nAs Christians you've been bullied you've\nBeen mocked in the air is been a straw man set up and your name\n\nAnd continually burned with the idea that your face lax reason\n\nThat your belief system is archaic outdated without intellectual and when he\nI'm passe I assure you it's not\nArchie Bunker\nSet on a on the family many many years ago that face you know face that's when you believe in something you know downright is not true\n\nAnd unfortunately the world tends to see Christianity is that way it's not that there aren't people with that have been gift with a simple face\n\nTo face that can move mountains that does not need all the articulation and all the understanding\nBut isn't it wonderful how your God sees fit to provide that for those who do need it the intellectual aspect\nIt doesn't replace faith faith will always be there that is that trust that the information is true that is that trust the guys there when you can't see him\nWhen you can't hear him when you can't feel him how many times have you heard on this very program people calling and saying I just can't feel God today\n\nWell God can feel you God Knows you're there\nTo get in that mindset that it's OK want answers to not want to know\n\nWhy and how things work\nIs okay as long as you know there are going to be some things that you can't know\nOr wouldn't help you if you didn't know\n\nHow many times have you gone through a trying experience\nAnd you said God why and you push through in faith and trusted\nAnd the circumstances changed and more of what I was going to pass that you were going down now unfolded before you\nThat you looked up and said oh okay I get it now\nThat face at that place of\nStrength when most people see chaos is what separates you\nHaving that understanding that there's someone that transcended the cares that's in control\nThat faith is powerful and it's real but it's not ignorant it is not stupid or foolish\nScripture says that you love your God with\nAll of your head all of your heart\nAnd all of your spirit\nThe entirety of who you are your physical nature your spiritual nature your intellectual major all of that\nIs how you love God and faith plays a part in the entirety of all that is\nBut when you apply face your life don't feel that it's out of ignorance don't feel that it's out of the lack of knowing that faith is based on your trust and understanding your knowledge of ... in your life\n\nAnd knowing that I Will never leave you nor for sake you\n\nThat is the beauty of face\nThere's T shirts that read ignorance is bliss faith is not ignorance\n\nIs not running around not understanding\n\nIt's truly burst from knowledge from knowing who got is knowing who got is in your life\n\nHow much better would it be for you to have faith Justin yourself the way others do\nHow would that help you how would you benefit\nIt's not that you don't have confidence in your abilities and your gifts the things that God has given you but those have faith only in themselves stopped short\nHaving faith in the creator\nThat one the one that knows all your nooks and crannies every ounce of who you are and how you work and even more so how you should work\nThat if the person you apply faced it\n[noise] uh\nFor\nFor [noise]\nIf you didn't bring it it's food it would crush your head\nUm the child doesn't have that strike so a wrestling with whether children are are innocent by biblical standards or not is\nA is not necessarily worthy of this discussion but is an academic one nonetheless I Will say that uh\nUh that this question deserves a little more focus so if you if you have a moment I'm gonna ask you Jeannie that hang tight as we take a really quick break and I want explained a little bit of a the dynamics of what goes on because everyone comes and says hey\nHow come you don't do it this way ... wouldn't this way work wouldn't that be much better and we'll look at those options and I'll show you why they are better at all\n\n\nFact\nLandmines man\nJesus Christ will return to be

taboo to be with you this Sunday's I'm with you every single Sunday right here answering your questions and talking about the things that truly matter in life\nAnd of course the afterlife I'd love to

problem same time same place\nAnd you can follow us on Twitter at Jesus' show at Jesus' show\nWe were talking with Jeanie Jeanie there yes I Am now your husband uh is is having issues with the fact that the babies are born with with disabilities and this and Pete's on his face\nPardon bison feeds in faith for food but does he have faith is Sara yes okay yes so he wrestles with it doesn't keep him from having face but it it he wrestles with it\nRight in ... and bring him down at that brings up the Turks somehow\nI I don't know well I Want to help them but I I've gotten thought that cat on\nWell it is normal and it is healthy for him to question these things because it it shows compassion on his part and and that's a good thing yeah so the question becomes you know I guess academically it becomes will know why does God allow these things right and not just reach in well it sounds simple\nBut it's kind of like when you start looking at things that you don't like in the United states and you start going I you know I don't like the way that person thinks oh I don't like the way they act I wish we could just ban that route then what ends up happening is what in the United states or the constitution says once you start banning that then\nThe things you can vote you believe in can be banned as well and it starts this whole cycle right the breaks down the entirety of the system so you have to let people be who they are um within reason as long as it doesn't cause danger harm to anyone else you have to allow people to be they are even if\nYou disagree now you stretch that or to God\nOver the universe and everything in it and saying what I Want are creatures that can love and the only way creatures can truly love is to allow them the option\nNot to love so I'm the only way you can allow creatures truly to love God or anything else the the only reason your husband knows that you love him is because you come home to him every night by choice that you ... if you had a gun to your head it wouldn't be love right\nYou'd just be doing it because he was forcing you so God force people to do right\nIt's no longer doing right it's like the uh\nUh you know putting a murderer in solitary confinement he doesn't murder anymore right he's not good because if you had the opportunity you would murder right so just because uh you know just because you took\nA the morality out of it or you assume that you you know I keep a this prisoner I'm so we can't kill that he now he's a better person no it just means he doesn't have the opportunity or the choice that's not better that's without any morality so\nGod in order to to create a a creature that has that can truly love has to give them an option not to love so what these creatures do some of them go towards gone\nSeeking God seeking God's will and God's love and loving God and therefore trying to abide by the rules of God which are the rules of the universe truly\nAnd I'm a when it comes to pollution or drugs or things like that um they would uh shun them but then there are those that look to cut corners to make more money to build a their empire to do all kinds of things are to get high to do whatever that\nAh pollutes the genetic line\nAnd then what ends up happening is you have mutations now not seeing the parents of some of a of a disabled child have done something there's themselves you're talking about it could be generations and generations generations of a a a go of people that they don't know\nI'm the purpose of that is to understand that everybody is responsible for one another and in in doing that you know it keeping in mind that there is the percentage\nOf of Americans that are disabled is approximately about Seventeen percent and of that percentage of disabled people about fifty percent of them are born that way so it it it makes you one say does it is a disabled person worth less than you\nOf course not of course not so what she looks at is the quality well why does this happen at all and and why would you know why would not allow this it has to be allowed in the process of things because in order to eliminate that I'm very boy that possibility would be to have to take away\nThe consequences of anything that people did wrong\nAnd you have to allow consequences in life 'cause that that helps build character it's like um if you think about all the wonderful things in life that you know ability courage all these things\nDo you need those don't exist without adversity do they uh you know a fireman or a firefighter cannot be a hero without a fire or some sort of adversity same with the law enforcement or anything like that so the balance of adversity\nAnd faith in strength and nobility and all these things love versus a indifference or even hate that these things only exist in this world in this way because this is not the best world Jeannie well it's the best way to the best world which is heaven\nAnd home advisor

they don't care\nWhat happened to them is the possibility of them being saved I mean I I I I'm Still confused in my mind that I'll never lose my faith but I can understand why that anybody can go up and killing innocent child with a guy\nWill there be extra people Murray there's going to be horrendous things that get that to to our and acted by people are without without any sort of rule of law in their heart there's no God in which the answer to there's no [noise]\nNo sort of rules they're going to exist they're going to continue to exist the purpose of\nOf preaching the gospel and teaching about the good news\nIs in the hopes of changing the hearts of man but until that happens until everyone comes to that conclusion you're going to have people that reject me that reject the word of God I reject the rules and the will of God and that's going to affect everyone\nThe worst thing about this is that uh it wasn't an accident and it wasn't like you know get dying of a disease or an accident or something and this was a deliberate murder\nI've been in the in fact he had just gone to the bank a few days before it started college fund it was only Seventeen\nAnd he got hurt anybody any what\nUh so we don't know it was some kind of an initiation at these gangs do or what we don't know anything about it\nAnd you're and you may never I mean law enforcement will do the best they can find out the answers but when you have when you have someone like your grandson there and then another group of people they may be the only witnesses\nWell I don't know if somebody had to call nine one one yet bullet holes in his chest ... you know I mean just riding a bike\nAnd and being ambush like that for no reason at all ... ... ... ... nobody can realize how devastating that is I'm an old lady I'm eighty two years old but I I my my health is I'll never be the same again and neither one of his mom\nYou know it it's just so devastating and these people don't they know that they kill off everybody along with you\nKnow they're not thinking like the breed they're not thinking the way you think\nYou know 'cause I could never heard anybody know of course not I wouldn't even\nPut my hand on a gun or even get near one and they go round carrying guns I don't I don't I mean I'm so confusing so injured I and I keep thinking that the child I Hope it goes right to heaven\n... of your grandson yes\nThere is there any reason for you to believe otherwise now than there you go\nNo you gotta you must be confident in a way that in all this chaos um the the the father has a plan\nAnd it says that in scripture that God turns all things to his glory and will reach an even into the ugliest times and there will be glory there will be good that comes from this not because that's a good bumper sticker whether it's a pat answer but because that's the truth of the matter that's so says scripture\nAnd that that there will be something to come from this but\nThat doesn't excuse what was done they know it's ridiculous to think that there are people that have no sort of moral compass to understand the direction they should be going and you're not going to understand I'm Glad you don't understand that Marie ... hit them but so you're looking for vengeance\nMarie you're looking for some sort of a immediate justice but I'll tell you something and this is where humans often look to me and get frustrated\nIs that I didn't just die for your grandson I didn't just die for you I dodged those guys would that gun to\n\nNow at this point they have not received that's completely obvious\n\nBut if if you think that the only people that can receive salvation or the people that are exactly like you that's not the truth but now you're you're mixing academics theology\nWith emotion none of this is\nThis is going to make sense not to be something you really care about when you're in pain\nBecause the theology of it all is that I came in I died that anyone that receives me and repentance and truly turns away from the that lifestyle\nThat is your goal Murray you can't bring your grandson back your hope should at least be that these people that did such a heinous and horrible act would be converted into human beings that are worthwhile\n\nThat can be productive and giving rather than destructive and taking\nThem\nBut to wish that loan them as a normal reaction emotionally\nA reasonably you should desire that they change\nFirst and foremost so they don't do this again so that no one else will have to go through the agony or the pain that you're going through Murray or\nThe family as a whole\nThat should be the goal not just vengeance scripture says vengeance is mine says God\n\nBecause it is only right just when I applied\n\nTo just sit in that place and be embittered\nOver it won't help then it won't bring your grandson back the fact is there a very ugly parts of this world world that continues to dying at the table of the enemy thinking\nUh well it doesn't matter and I'm not into all that religious stuff anyways and\nI'm tired I don't like all the rules and being found and tied down to everything that scripture essay I'm going to do what I Want and even in that small brass of saying he will do what you want you a partner in yourself you're married yourself to the same\nEvil as these gang members that would take the life of a Seventeen year old boy it's no different than the eyes of God you're rejecting the will of God\n\nAnd people have to understand the marriage between those things\n\nAnd I'm Sorry that you're going through the pain you are and your family's going through the pain they are\n\nInto the will of God allow\nGod's will to motivate you and your decisions closer you get to God the more of the world that will ensure confuse you\n\nMore of the world that should seem foreign and bizarre\nThat\nMay sound strange but that's the truth\n\nYou see to a child there ways are normal\nBut when you get older and you look back at the things you did as a child don't you look back at them and go wow that really wow\nThat is different I was just not thinking\nAs you were you're just thinking with a five year old brain or six year old\nBrain did you grow\nIn your face you'll do the same you will grow in a way where you will continue to look back at yourself and then seeing that gross notice how far you were off the Mark Pryor and you'll do that with the world as well you see how far they are away from being in the will of God\nThat's part of your gross that's part of you becoming truly a new creation and Christ you should expect that\nTo win the world starts to make the least amount of sense you'll know that you are at the closest point of knowing me\n\n\nHard radio is easy to use that for music and reading

don't want I don't I don't want that near my name at all I don't want people are associating that with me [noise] but what I Do want is somebody who is confident or in their world view and will stand upon that and defend it\nAnd I don't feel now they're not here to defend themselves in all fairness and to ah make their case but in just in the context in which you're telling me I don't feel they're being fair no I I agree with you that's not very fair\nAnd there are a lot of Christians that do that that's my hope for this program is to shed light on things and help people reason three things strangely enough\nThat's directly from scripture scripture says come let us reason together it says to worship God with all of your heart all of your soul and all of your mind or Christians should not have to leave their brain at the door or when they come into the kingdom of God\nNow diverse in which you're referring to is although your um this is a family member\nYeah I'm more than a lot of the three people or we don't live near that I'm there all the all of them are\nAre in another state okay well I Love your statement earlier that we are truth seekers absolutely that really made an impact\nOtherwise who cares than than no one's right when you can you can both be wrong but you can't be right\nThe purpose of truth scripture throughout you see things where people say God is love absolutely but God is truth and it's not some false truth it's not you know truth is relative all of that is garbage truth is not relative truth is truth\nThey that statement doesn't even make any sense\nSo there if there is truth it's absolute truth if there's absolute truth you know it and you can learn it and you can live at so\nWhen you're talking about um first Corinthians chapter one versus Nineteen although this is where it was quoted from I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the cleverness of the clever I Will set aside its really quoting\nAnd a copy of my latest book the

your holy host\nHappy to be with you this\nSunday is I'm with you every single Sunday right here answering your questions and talking about things that really matter in life and of course the afterlife\nI encourage you to be bold and brave and go to the phone with your theology question or life situation question anywhere in the U.S of a dial eight seven seven holy host numerically that's eight seven seven for six by nine for six seven\nYou can also follow us during the week and during the show on Twitter at Jesus' show\nAnd Jesus show and you can check at our website if you want to hear more of the show during the week you find out about our archive club there the Jesus Christ show dot com that Jesus Christ show dot com\n\nYou know I'm the confines of this show sometimes are not always fun having to cut costs short like talking enjoying talking with Jay I Want to make some things [noise]\nA clear as we run out of time and and one thing I didn't get to say the J is to um cut some slack to your family members and and trust that they're not doing this to be malicious there doing it because they think they're defending me and they're defending truth\nThey're not doing it to the harm you or any of those things they're doing it because they believe it to be true the unfortunate part is when people don't feel that they can actually come together and discuss these things because it becomes a pride issue\nThat's what I poked fun I poked fun at the\nPride of some of the fun ones a fundamentalist communities and fundamentalism in its in its core\nIs wonderful\nIt's this is this is what we believe and we're sticking to it we're understanding\nAnd an open mind it's not by having an open mind for the sake of an open mind I don't understand that people say oh well you you you're too close minded well you know what an open mind is the same as an open mouth it's open until something of value nutritionally\nIs placed in it and then the closest to consume and that digest\nDoesn't remain open\nFor everything there is some things you know two plus two equals four there's no need to remain open on that equation\n\nSo when I tease it because I Know that there are those that get closed and locked in a room and do not want to think past that and I don't want that here\n\nAnd if you get offended by that or you shut down that means that you're not receiving\n\nSometimes a people last go well you know who do you like talking to more answering questions believers or atheists\nThey said one sometimes atheist because their hand is a sense essentially empty\nAny place things in it\nBut the Christian sometimes the ... it's closed and intimate into a fist and you can't get anything else in there can help them see any differently\nAnd the church has gone through reformation and the church has gone through a lot of different things and the way it went through those things is because somebody stood up and said hey look at this see this differently and you may disagree we have Catholics that lives in this program that our brothers and sisters we have Protestants it listens program that our brothers and sisters\nBut you have to admit that change comes from understanding and seeing things in there in newness and there's a lot to scripture and it's an amazingly beautiful book of truth and to think that you've\nIt all wrapped up\nIt's not a fair assessment is Jewish and learn learn together scripture says that ah that are in short burns Iron Man to another man to be in discussion to talk about the things that are important\nCome together dialogue debate healthy to argue hopefully\nDo these things is productive its production to the body Christ and makes Christians look fair and reasonable\nNormal not just like people who are ignorant war unyielding ... teachable who wants to be around somebody on teachable\nSo please turn remind yourself the scriptures says come with us reason together among\n\nJesus Christ

that is if if on friday morning I give somebody all the money that I have uh my name and I gave them even offer them\nKnowing full well on Sunday night I'm going to walk into the California lottery office with my hundred million dollar winning ticket and I I Know that full well in advance of them got this money coming to me than what am I really high profile case what am I really given of myself knowing full well that I'm going to really make out you know like gangbusters and\nSurely and in would that analogy you're absolutely right\nSo so so what did Jesus really give up a what a God really give up because if you die but then you came back two days later and nobody else is able to do that\nWell here's the thing um and there's not going to be an analogy is using you know joking logic that all of allergies breakdown not a very funny joke but to ... they think it's hilarious though all analogies breakdown that means that if you extrapolate and extrapolating extrapolate eventually every analogy is gonna fall apart because\nThey're just analogous they're not truly the exact same thing so um\nI understand is that the the biggest problem with the man is it as it deals with God is that man continues to make God a bigger him rather than got\nSo when you try an anthropomorphic we attach Mike attributes to God there's always going to be a translation problem now you have God that cramps deity into a a human vessel and puts it on earth for thirty three some odd years\nAnd ah there's a great purpose behind that and there's going to be some that you know here and some that you'll know later I'm a depending on where you stand with God\nBut if you were to think of it this way Mike um have you ever done any jail time\nNever would you ever want to know\nOK course not good answer now if you were to uh go to jail when you were guilty it would stink when sure but imagine going to jail if you were innocent would there not be a greater\nA sacrifice if you were innocent and in jail versus being guilty and in jail they both have the sacrifice of not having freedom and all of that but there's an extra element\nThat if you were truly innocent Mike to be sitting in that jail cell cell would be a a something greater than just somebody who's guilty correct correct okay now if you take that and you extrapolate the fact that God he's innocent and perfectly just\nAnd took taking on the sins of the world is a sacrifice everybody gets caught up in the death the deaths and the resurrection was about the payment for you that that is so you have the opportunity\nOr to reunite\nAnd be bridged with God but the pain or what took place is something you will never understand because you can never be innocent\nNever people refer to children as being innocent children or even in a sense there was never a point where you and your life ever have been truly innocent my I have now that the the\nSacrifice it's taking place you see is the physical this is the anthropomorphic language that I was talking about humans tend to look at that and go wow that's great I Would love to be able to die and then resurrect because then I could do whatever I Want it it's not that way\nIt's not like a superhero type situation this is God taking on the sins that other people\nDid into\nHis body which is now flash\nAnd consuming that it's nothing you could ever compared to you because you're going hey it's a magic trick and that's not that's not a sacrifice Mike you give money every month to your landlord\nWhether that be a ... a person or whether that'd be a bank\nAnd that's a sacrifice even though you will make that money up the next month standing on your analogy you do make that money back\nNow you don't make the same money back but you make the money back because you work for it it's still going to be a sacrifice the the potency of what took place won't ever be understood by man because they'll always look at it as well you got your life back no\nThat's not what took place in that sense\nThrough physically taking on an spiritually taking on the debt in the sins of the entire world there is nothing that you could ever analogize nothing that you could ever compare or truly understand the loss which is why you use money as a reference or [noise]\nBeing able to get the life back can I can I jump in here absolutely\nUm I mean I grew up in the Christian faith and I mean I've I've hurt me these statements and sentiments in various various degrees but I still keep coming back to it if\nI understand the preaching the message but I don't understand how that didn't anything and I explained it this way God could have looked around said okay I made all these people that I Love and they said they're not going to get into and\nUm so I Need to create this way that they can get to heaven you know he could do it all powerful you could have just said I forgive you all you still have your free well\nNo no no no no no no no Mike because once again you're looking for the quick way out that's a human way out in just ... I mean there was an option\nAnd no no no but it's not a God ... Mike option it's not a God option and the reason why it's not a God option is because it's not just it just clears the plate\nThere is a balance of justice that is here that people don't understand it is the ability to sin that causes the distance God doesn't just want closeness it's not like oh gosh you just want you to come home at any cost you know it's that it's gotta be through this balance of justice Mike but\nHe died how did how did you dying do anything that's what I don't understand people say well Jesus died for me well okay well what they're\nPaid the price it made it just you couldn't just get in because ah well we'll just it's not waving a debt see the ... still hangs this is the human mentality the human mentality is if I gamble all my money\nAnd someone else pays for it and good but in the world of true justice that balance is still not paid because it wasn't paid by you\nSo in this particular case God takes it on I'm going to ask you to hang on tight uh Mike as we come across this break 'cause I Want to talk to you some more but you can't just pay for it like that it's not about wiping it clean it's that it has to be wiped clean justly\n[noise]\n[noise]\nNo [laughter] [noise]\nVersus a off the U.S means exactly what the words meat\nLike knocked noga knowledge atheism is about a week I'm just saying I don't believe that makes me an eighth I came in ...\nSo you're saying that outside of your knowledge Mike there might be a God\nYes but I was not an offense to it so I don't believe in okay\nThat would fall into it enough to some of these levels of atheism I'm not sure why you want to debate that I mean I've been at that oh so you're you're you're an atheist with a little a\nI'm an agnostic atheist okay fair enough that I how come you're not a theorist\nAnd not have the has become more searching that I Do the more I Try to understand God them or I or you know I did lots of praying I called to him I ask for him to intervene to to change my heart\nAnd there was no no response to your liking the little time again unfortunately\n[noise] ooh\n\nOoh [noise]\n[noise]\nOoh [noise]\nJesus Christ show will return to be a part of a show called

know leaves and branches are ... in your face it's hard to get to the root of things I Will tell you this\nUm and uh I I Hope\nAnd then I'm fairly confident and Michael Cole again some time we'll have another chat\nUm my statement stands that to\nAtheism offseason without God the belief that there is no God is something that stems from for emotional reasons I think we were just starting to get their unfortunately I'm\nIn order to have a belief like that or to have a belief that stamp and forgive me because I Know a Michael's no longer on the air I I don't want to speak for him but I Want you to understand a bigger concepts\nUh I'm not sure the Mike wants answers are necessarily we didn't have the the full time to explore all that so um we looked at what we could\nJust thought that an event changes your mind usually is what points to the fact that it's an emotional response and an intellectual response I Do I Will give you this that the that can they can both play a part do you throw up face\nSeems to be the the thing that goes out the quickest\nAnd so that's unfortunately where we have to leave it\nBut uh we will we will talk again and I just a sink Mike for the spending so much time and hanging over the break to uh to chat with us I Wish it was a little more fruitful but perhaps a next time Rob welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nIdeas here if I\nGot to college with a ex roommate who I've known for about Twenty years you started following a a kind of a religious teacher and he went south and for some reason he just stopped paying rent for about\nThree months and more ... they gave him the boot and at the final and and I said we need to talk about the money that you are\nThe guys just pull on running from me every chance he and um\nDo you think he's involved in a cult or something like that or a\nA he's a he's following a summer radio right or Waco, Texas okay and I'm very big on a kind of like a positive concussion stuff okay I'll be a money\nOh so it's not like the health and well the gospel or the the name it and claim it or is it the label on it\nIt feels like that but it seems a little more scream because\nBasically what when I talk to him and I said we need to sit down and tried to corner among some issues and tried to get a person to me that he won't even eat with me I Can't I Can't even wrecked can't even negotiate or even play to\nFind some sort of conclusion yeah or even\nYou're ... ... well anyway I even read from I'm from the standpoint of our friendship in the back and he opened that the Bible\nAnd declare it occurs to me from the Old Testament weight and boy I don't believe in oh boy I mean\nYou don't believe in the eight minutes per okay good [laughter] I was gonna say I mean he was out half the good stuff okay\nIt cost me a ... award would write me with blindness and madness and um and then he basically gotten it on ... and I don't frankly I use the money I could work come to a solution\nUm I Know that the guy if it out on a lot of his commitment if he's propped up by it quite on issues very um\nWell you're not there to judge is hard but you can judge and obviously this is not a legal show but the uh you can't judge the fairness of ... of the situation and a morally respond you have every right to sue him\nRight oh I Do have a right to oh I'm absolutely okay we're talking about not bringing a brother or and\nI Know the purpose of that is that in Hebrew that talks about going to your brother first and explaining the situation and then secondly you you bring that yeah obviously that was done and then and then you can bring it to any outside a source that's necessary and this you know\nThe Christians make mistakes Christians do stupid things and it's even questionable as to who is following particularly now anyways\nBut I'm ... years still accountable\nThis is the thing that's important it's it's it's it's about can you forgive it sure you can forgive the debt if you feel like it um but I'm not sure who's going to learn or who who gains from that\nAh the purpose of this is that uh to know that God is adjust God and so it's not just about this going away but that there's justice done so uh if you feel that you've been wronged and the you know judicial system of the United states of America feels that he's in the wrong\nThen you you file a lawsuit and see what comes of that but that whole the point of the scripture is listen as Christians you you you are bound by the laws of the land and you're bound by the laws of God\nLook to the laws have gone first to see if there's a way for you can recognize ... to reconcile what's taking place and to do it that way first and foremost", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "city": "San Diego", "day": "21"}
