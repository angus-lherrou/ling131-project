{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "From day one or maybe I'm you know you're Twenty one let's call it\nAlways loved the stuff but as far as the book I think that a lot of ways that came about from just picking up these things\nOver the years I think I could look back to college when you have a beer bottle of beer that found a twist off but you don't have it opener\nUm but somebody always had a bit later on them and I got taught a kind of the party trick or being able to to wage a bottle of beer open with a lighter um and then you know kind of accumulate some others along the way and then you know it was\nSilly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make this a book\n[laughter] the the big lighter that's if if I followed along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against the tightly gripped finger around\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there um with illustration diagrams\nAnd everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're actually using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a for 'em so it's all highly scientific as you can do\nRight [laughter] end up for those in desperation mode even holding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same way\nI think yeah that's a great one that was actually um something of a bar bet to where you tell people buy but she can open this year with a piece of paper that way and\nAh and then you fold it six or seven times until you have a thin very stiff battle hunk of paper um and use the same principles and then somebody owes you a beer [laughter]\nWe're speaking with Ben Robbins and he's got a new book called ... tips tricks and projects he's also editor in chief of the observer what about the some of these projects which put together on that\nOh man so these are really fun um a lot of them in all of\nWrapping a empty beer bottle with a piece of string that you go to an actual tone and awaiting it on fire [noise] um so that was you know one of one of the more enjoyable testing phases\nOf creating this book um but it'll basically sever its way through the beer a and you can turn it into a a glass of drinking glass to then put beer in um I'd recommend you know standing\nHeavily on the edge to protect your mouth I'm can create tiki torches or that you can put outside to\nWard off ... which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their time on this uh mosquitoes love people who've been drinking beer so you gotta\nGotta fight 'em off um [noise] yeah there's a number of other you can make shot glasses I'm with the basically the the bottom ... um that you've severed off\nBut this other southern classification is other type of trial that comes your way is a spiritual trial these are attacks\nThat strangely enough or often brought on by you when you invite the enemy in your life it's like inviting the the devil for dinner for whatever it is in your life that you're doing there are times where you do things where you welcome the enemy in\n\nAny Christian any Christian family can take on attacks from the enemy\nBut as a believer you must remember that the the knob of your spiritual\nDoor is on the inside and it's only open by you the devil can't truly getting your life unless you open the door and give him opportunity\nThis opportunity comes from you rejecting things have God straying from the things have gone looking for that opportunity that you know it was not godly looking for that relationship that you know was not godly rejecting things that you know our godly\nYou've opportunities in your life come your way and you think well just because they came your way they must be of God not always there are relationships that are not good for you\nThere's jobs that you shouldn't be it or maybe there's another one that is coming your way that would be a better for you there are things that you do to manipulate at times so bad\nThat you welcome the enemy and\nYou get to that place where it doesn't matter what the consequences are you just want what you want\nYou're giving the deaf one opportunity when you ignore the warning signs the red flags in your life how many times in this very program have a we open the phone lines in and talk to people that have called up and they have warning signs and relationships or situations and they ignore them\nWhen you go through something like this when you ignore\nThose\nRed flags those warning signs the alarms that are going off in your life your giving the enemy and opportunity seasons for twenty seven says and do not give the devil an opportunity\nPointing out that you play a part and as you play a part in the dance in the interaction with the enemy the devil himself to play a part in your life\nNow you may make excuses for it you may look for a reason and say well I was doing this because well I was lonely and I wanted someone in my life but when doing that when the loneliness\nOr your situation supersedes what you know to be right or good or the will of God then you open up that door and say come on in devil and you invite the devil dinner\nBecause that seems like a better plan than waiting on God\nThe enemy profiles around you looking for this opening even masquerading to look more pleasant to you\nTrying to fool you to look like an opportunity for relationship to look like a job opportunity to look like an opportunity to get something easier\nLess stress making something more Tina bull to satisfy that that quick fix\nPeter five eight ... be a sober spirit beyond the alert your adversary the devil profiles around like a roaring line seeking someone to devour don't like\nThat someone but you don't give the enemy the opportunity to consume you second Corinthians eleven fourteen says no wonder for even Satan disguise themself as an angel of like if you get caught up in that that appearance way things appear to you\nAnd it looks like hey here's that opportunity I Want it\nNot always is that the right way to go\n... says to test all things hold fast to that which is true if you're constantly running after whatever opportunity comes your way\nYou'll set yourself up\nYou allow people in your life that you know aren't good for you you set yourself up you open yourself up if you disregard the thing is if God you treat people poorly you don't\nFollow the rules in life changing them all ways to do your needs\nYou open it up for the enemy\nYou surround yourself self with a things in life that are of vulgar or contrary to God or ugly\nYou open up the opportunity and each of these opportunities\nAre an opening a crack a possibility for the enemy to enter a fishing for twenty seven again and do not give the devil and opportunity\nAny crack any Fisher\nTeeny little opening in your life it's an opportunity for the enemy\nSo how does the fateful believer defend themselves against the enemy

then there's all the various holiday in the world [noise]\nAnd um you know if that confusing thing because people do different things and uh and I I'm Betty how\nAre we to witness and um I was ... by their thing about Christmas that really brought a light to me that that is tempered twenty if it's not a that it isn't there and then I think about it and think about it and I did research and things and um\nYou know like for example a lot of these cards are greeting card or they'll fight like Mother's Day Father's Day grandparents a secretary a an added in them\nAnd that you know in in scripture kind of take a Roman a Fifteen five\nI'm On work till the end of the subject but really the heart that\nWe don't live for ... well we have driven to the lord we there whatever a we have served to God and that we do it and get spanked than we shouldn't be checking our our brother that that we should get not do the things that are are blatantly um\nSo are you worried about celebrating holidays\nBecause I I I'm I'm not so much worried about it I ... and I am totally embrace each day it's a blessing and and and do the best you can with it and you know 'cause everybody knew how old they were you know in the Bible\nI won't tell you this there's nothing wrong with holidays are they the holy days of the past no hum are a lot of them a ... at a bare minimum embellished by the greeting card companies absolutely but that doesn't mean that you can't celebrate a mother or someone's burst or\nAny of these things I think that uh\nThere are some groups or some may consider them fringe groups or\nThat or take this to a degree where they don't celebrate anything and it's a it's to me that is more\nMilitant\nAnd on Christian in the the attitude of celebrating all things I mean for this one ... of five sixteen and Eighteen rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks all circumstance where this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you there's\nThere's ... ... do you need a special day no but then you could say the same about the Sabbath you don't need a special day for that either it's just a matter of taking the time and\nAnd rejoicing and celebrating people and sometimes it's easier\nTo put something on the calendar or than it is because people put it off all the time\nYou do it with relationships of any kind you do it with friendships with getting together for coffee or tea\nHe or lunch or dinner or whatever it might be you put them off constantly and sometimes it's easier just to get something on the calendar and said this is the day that we're going to celebrate mothers or fathers or family or friends or whatever it might be\nAnd some of them may feel silly and you don't have to celebrate them and yes you can go back to the origins of Christmas and Easter and you can look that they weren't celebrated by the early church and of course I wasn't born in December\nUm it wouldn't make sense biblical e based on what was taking place during the time on my birth all those things absolutely true however there's nothing wrong with taking a time\nPutting it on the calendar and the case of things like Christmas and Easter there were pagan holidays during that time or the early church wanted to try and root those big and holidays out so they kind of plopped\nMy birth and my resurrection into those slots to try and squelch or squash\nThe pagan a religious ceremonies or uh festivals for things like that and that was the way of the early church trying to kind of get their way I get all that but\nIt doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't even matter there's pagan uh ties in\n... when it comes to Christmas and it comes to Easter the the bunny rabbits the eggs all that stuff comes from pagan roots of the Christmas tree itself I'm is tied to pagan roots but it doesn't matter because that's not what people are celebrating\nAnd so to take a time of celebration who enjoy any more than people are celebrating you know pay guns

I'm saying is when it got cut up your ankles if they landed in Atlanta or it could five hundred years ago and what does it go and the nutrition culture happier than its variants head and all that energy just came back to\nConfess that you know that that was the wrong way of worship the right way to set the record straight if you would if you take out all the religions the timelines in which

record straight because we are actually a couple of ... actually took our Bible ... ...\nThere are theories are based on similar notions the\nProblem is that\nUh the timeline is based on the timeline is when it becomes difficult when you're dealing with falling angels\nAnd the concept of fallen angels I talk about revelation twelve seven through nine talking about the battle with Michael in his angels fighting against the dragon or\nSatan there's no specific time as a matter of fact when something's happening in heaven and that\nConcept it's really outside of time so if you're using that as a basis to say okay well it started here and\nThere are similarities no doubt similarities may point to a\nStandards through point where you have a belief systems starting here moving through here some parts are taken some parts are removed some some of its polluted some of it's added to what have you I get that and that has most certainly taken place but to try and track trace it back entirely\nTo the fallen angels might be a little difficult\nFrom a historical or\nTimeline perspective but absolutely no doubt that with\nThe falling of the angels and the angels coming to earth as it says in scripture says in that very scripture revelation twelve seven through nine talks about or that he was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him\nThat in that process that there there wasn't counterfeit and destruction and things that went along with it so I get the big picture of where you're going and how you look at it looks like\nHere you had a face and then how you have those those that would be motivated to destroy that face\nCausing pollution and counter fits in all these things that would twist it around and that you say that you can kind of traced that back but I think there's you're dealing with other things that are\nOutside the timeline of history and then within the timeline of history and that poses kind of a problem to figure out as to what\nTook place when and where man stands in in the whole equation as well\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nYour own\nPerson oh jeez\nSome on the youth prayer and someone who cares\nYou know or something oh

didn't think they were all going to make it\nIt's not a situation like that so no worries there there is there's no a limit to where somebody will be left out that believes there\nIsn't I mean there there are all these people are shaped by chosen perish just going around and have and I know this sounds parents like many school as far as a white is whatever but [noise] it\nIt does not just not

our\nIt yet doesn't it doesn't matter doesn't there is no uh limitations there now as far as the second question and answer\nBefore you're just like coach high percentage how I Do have a very brief ... third question about the practices and trust and very ... I may ask you have to answer this other question [noise]\nSure sure or ...\nOr ... being reborn not being able to remember going through\n... ... ...\nThat's not Christianity that say you you quoted some versus earlier in Corinthians and uh in Hebrew loosely paraphrase them about a ... in Corinthians about so is there to be up to from the buddies to be present with lord\nBut it also says in Hebrew state your um it's appointed for men to die once and then the judgment\nSo there is no there is no place for what is referred to as to some sorrow that cycle of life there is no place for reincarnation reincarnation was never in scripture a there is no place for it it doesn't fit\nAnd uh and and so that doesn't make sense with Christianity or\nEven in the church and I know so little not out there but he does have an urge to Cape\n... stuff beyond [noise] basically ... that had\nGeorge ... a lovely man a very smart man and he does have very interesting I guess on coast to coast\nI Am a but but his his job and his focus is not the same as the ... I saw the show\nSo so ... he's looking at things from a broader spectrum then this this program as we're very focused on the Christian Judeo Christian priest opposition and the Christian theology and specific so\nUh we obviously have a different point in and when it comes to that so in this particular case\nThere is nothing in scripture that allows for that\nReincarnation and there's no need for it now there be those that argue or Catholic brothers and sisters argue that there is a purgatory but there are different but there's different beliefs in that that has changed throughout the years as well as to what that means what's taking place\nUm but as far as mainstream Christianity or Protestantism um they differ so mainstream Christianity deeply Catholicism in ... in that same basket they're going to they're going to defer I'm Still keep in mind there's differences are very quickly so we can make sure that we are shared everyone else\nYou had one more question you want to do a as\nQuick a venture\nProbably the most part we know until it for hours I went to Catholic Church going up on everything\nI Do it on my other friends that I mean I [laughter] I Know this is why when actually\nIt's just I mean it's like why does that manifest an entirely true when I got on President only under what I call here I\nDon't get that I I mean I get my hands [laughter] got to make it\nDepends because in this is nuts or specifically speaking about anyone who refreshed themselves as a faith healer a lot of that is garbage a lot of it ties in to theatrics and whatnot and psychology that takes place during\nA a group experience like that that doesn't mean that it can't take place of course\nThere are gifts to the spirit that do take place nearest humans that could take place to this day but that is God's will ... will up an individual or um their ability or we'll speak through somebody like a profit and got ... ... somebody like a healer\nBut it's not done in the ... go way the way it often is portrayed in Christianity across the board there are many of those that um you know act as if they are faith healers and really it's amount of theatrics and people get caught up\nIn something the same way you can watch a movie that you know was absolutely fake they that it is factors that you've seen many times before you could start to cry or get angry or a beef thrilled by the outcome\nBecause emotionally you're having an experience with those uh other people in the cedar while watching something so you have to be careful as to what your experience is your experience should always be lining up with scripture and things of God and it should never be to the glory of an individual other than God\nI'm you shouldn't have to pay for such a thing these types of things\nI should be thought of a before you you go and experience and things because they can be a quite emotional\nAnd um yeah I mean you can get you up in that kind of overall attitude and and excitement and you can think that it's spiritual when it's just psychological something to think about a brother and not be lost in that\nObviously a Christ is talking there about the children being in heaven um and this is an argument that goes back and forth this is a place where really safe comes in and you have to trust that when uh the ugliness of something like a child dying takes place that a God\nI'm God has a way of balancing these things out that really accountability and salvation is based on acceptance or rejection not ignorance and that's where the confusion sometimes

was going on I have mixed feelings about it maybe I shouldn't do it or maybe it's cursed um is this really what God's Plan is is\n... ... if they use the white guy and you know I decided that you know this wasn't about me any more about my daughter accepting Jesus Christ or why I'm a white her what happened I'm Wade decided to do it but I was wondering if there's any metric after all\nWell I'll tell you ... ... ... ... first I'm very proud of you because you push through it the enemy had you at every turn on that one he would have loved nothing more than you to turn that car around and not have your daughter baptized\nIt would've been a huge victory in his eyes\nAnd you push through it there were a lot of things that are going to take place you drive on roads every day that people have lost loved ones on every day\nYou've done to hospitals where people have died you've gone to restaurants where people have been a it's gotten sick or might've choked on something\nDeath is a part of life it's everywhere\nBut you need to see the significance of the instance and what's taking place rather than the fact that there's a history of something now if that child died because there was something in\nThat water I wouldn't blame you but because of a freak accident or someone dying\nOr to not use you know there's a reason that it's the same place this particular church or churches in general in that area may use this for you said it was a Christian camp or a a and now it's a Christian baptism\nThat they're just you know it's a body of water in the area it's it's normal for it to be used\nIn different purposes but what I Want you to take from this is the fact that things aren't evil unto themselves there isn't an evil thing in the world\nIs when morally neutral things or have bad relationships so for instance when\nAnd a child is an a unintended or doesn't swim well water can be evil in the relationship between that person in the water and they can drowned\nBut in a baptism that's controlled and uh there are people around to watch and it's done structurally um it can be a beautiful thing about the awakening of someone's spirit and the acknowledgement of their face\nSo likewise if someone broke into your house heaven forbid with a gun that's a bad thing but if\nBehind them law enforcement broke into your house with a gun that's a good thing\nAnd so I Want

like that situation link it's very sad that you had to witness that it's such a young age or at all and it's going to be a you know an indelible mark on your life forever\nBut I Hope that it will be

I I think my children every two weeks before you know they that's what they said that a number of all I can do\nThey'll do you drink at all uh I I did I did a juggling and sober now excuse me you're clean and sober now\nI'm not quite not quite and what is not quite man\nThe times when I when I Would do anything to kill [noise] you\nKnow that that's not productive and it won't help you see those ...\nAbsolutely and and I I Am I'm a Christian and but I Know that it that if this is not the right thing I Know\nI mean you are you drinking today at all no I'm not good that's a good start\nSo Dale when it when it comes to relationships you get two people obviously you both have a say and you both can take the ... the you know you can either positively move in one direction together or you can\nMove into different directions chances are if we parsed your ... relationship when we looked back there was a time when you saw\nSigns of maybe she not being the right one and then people bring children into the equation all of that we don't have time for that but what I Do want to tell you is that\nUm if you live in a bowl of just staring at that circumstance she's married and she's moved on\n'em you won't be able to dig yourself out you know\nIf you get it to a place where your bettering yourself you're not you know getting into the ... you're not drinking you or are being productive and you're finding ways to me I Would encourage you to help others\nA and there's programs for people that have been cheated on and things like that that you can go into talk and find out the things that people have gone through and how they've pushed themselves through it\nPrayer and church and all these things play a part of all this then you can move forward yourself and find\nYou know that happiness or or a partner in life but if you're going to focus on the past I'm On the program a lot of times and and I know pain it's difficult to get through but there's a limit there's a certain amount of pain that comes from the experience and then the rest is that you putting it on yourself\nAnd I um I like in the past two driving ... and when you're driving you have a rearview mirror but you use the rearview mirror only to move forward right to change lanes\nUm to make sure that you're driving safely but you would never drive staring in the rearview mirror ... wouldn't you because if if you just stared at the rearview mirror you crash right\nAbsolutely and that's what you're doing right now you're driving I Know staring in the rearview mirror so\nI Know I and I don't want to I I Want to move forward I really do\nSo today you need to you need to start and actually have a process whether it's setting up time to go to ...\n... and be a constructive there you need to find a charity or something where you can put your time into helping others not ... in your own pain\nAnd you need to dedicate yourself to those things and continue to build up your own wants and desires in life and the things that make you you do so that you'll be attractive to somebody\nBut somebody who's ... who's ... ended up is not going to be attractive to any woman that's going to be good for you\nYou got to clean yourself up your daddy and your child to God and you got to clean yourself up and then when we come\nAnd you'll you build your life and fulfill it by yourself and then you'll be ready for another partner but to sit in the pain isn't going to help and that's the best I can tell you it's about ... right now\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOh Jesus Christ show will return in a moment to be a part of a show called seven seven radios\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a seats that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an airline while also having easy access to it while there is\nCheck out the rhino iron works at ... dot com\nAmerican Made an antique styled our Shapes Our part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you like the classic look of our rental iron works shapes we also feature beautiful matching told chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and a huge network\nHere's the rough part when it comes to abortion um\nIt's important it is a a a vulgar display in many ways\nAnd to get into the details what's taking place or would make most people lose their breakfast however I assure you that the ... everybody has made it a political issue which is to me\nAlmost equally as vulgar because what gets lost on both sides\nIs the fact that there is no one in less there's some bizarre twisted in an individual there is no one on either side that wants to see a baby die no one of the confusion comes\nBecause there are ... what really sets the two sides apart is the definition of when it's a baby\nSo the but no one setting out to kill babies and I it's the that's an ugly sought to think that that's what people are really doing they're not a ... it's just the definition when it's a baby so science says something different than theology [noise]\nYet as a scientist you or they're representing the laws of the land and medicine to take care of your patients\nWell the ... currently says that under certain circumstances um during certain times of the pregnancy that to abort the pregnancy is okay\nUh-huh if you're in a public facility your job is to\nUh give them the information they need to make the best decisions they can but the decision is not on us on the individual just like in anything your job is to give them the best information but the patient can say no I don't want to take the pill or no I don't want to follow up\nThey can even tell you that they don't want you to resuscitate them right correct and you\nCould say that that's against God's will because now you are allowing them to make a decision to to not live\nSo there's a lot of weight on you as a physician and uh in the nursing community as well that those that are in the medical\nProfession to give the best information and that's what you're called to do it's not a point of preaching\nNow if you feel that there's an opportunity and you want to make sure that they have the best information of both sides that's fine but as far as allowing somebody in the United states to make that decision there are laws to protect them to be able to do so and if you're going to be a physician in a public\nOr in the public arena uh-huh they are going to be allowed to do that\nFor profit article author fact not\nChris from a pet I mean we treat people are fake or not on my farm and lever and so what would you say\nThat lead us\nWell if they don't if they don't feel comfortable with doing that there might be a way around that for you to allow someone else to uh-huh or ... or things of that nature or wherever there's a point where if you're going to be in that industry\nAnd it is in the United states and it is legal\nThen there's going to be issues and she can even or he can even make a claim and say hey it as a person to face this\nMe and I don't want to be a part of it and it's fair to a certain degree but there's a point where if\nThe laws are with the laws are and if you don't want to participate in that then you know if you had a job is witness and they're just didn't believe in blood transfusions uh-huh now that becomes an issue and and that starts to infringe on the individual's right\nWho has a legal right to get a blood transfusion there going well I don't want to fill up the paperwork or I don't want to do this and that becomes a little sticky so if there are ways around it that can be done ... and just does not impede on the legal rights individual rights of the person wanting whatever treatment that is legal\nUm then you can adapt to those but you can't just hope the system based on your face because in that process um you're taking away the rights of an individual um that is legal in the United states and that that becomes a problem as well um to those that want to choose that so\nMy comment kids like ... that\nI'm an either or but that's why I Would not have a fund that portion lifestyle good but here I\nLike on Saturday eater I'm not sure that I worked when I Would be with you and that would not perform question right yeah and if I wait you're betraying who\nHooked up with the abortion I weigh referred to a colleague of mine and burned down because people were out there right here\nWhere there are right or wrong and I am I right on that if I and I think what is\nComply with the Irish than my thought is\nThat one out so far away and that that with my comfort to like I Need to get you\nKnow I think that's a very honest way of approaching it because if you start becoming the the Christian police it becomes problematic now let's say you're a checker at a grocery store\nAnd now you're ... you're looking at Twinkies and ... and the person in front of you is overweight\nAnd you start going all I'm not going to sell this to you because you're obviously abusing it or any of those you start policing everybody's option and if the freedoms exist in the United states you have to allow that now you don't have to do it yourself in that sense but your your practice has to have somebody\nThat is able to write that referral or to do that otherwise you stopped being a practice\nAunts or a medical practice and starts being a religious practice um which becomes a problem and I think that your your your console was very fair and honest and looking at making sure everybody's taking care of and I think that was the right way to go about it\nI think you're You're welcome and thank you for what you do it's a it's a\nVery important thing that you do it and I I Know that your face ties into it and you're praying for people and you're being there and that makes you a even more important out there is a position to have the balance between your scientific mind and your spiritual sense as well I think is a very important a part\nOf the medical industry this is a incredibly difficult subject but I really want people to here and the ... the left with the thought that nobody wants to kill babies\nNobody does I Know that's the easier way to think about it and to look at it it's not about that it's the definition of when they see a baby\nAnd it may be different than yours and that's part of the fight part of the fight is to to get science to see that in and I'm as they see that then that will change but as if the majority of doctors see that as tissue and not yet a baby then it wouldn't matter what you do indoor say\nWhen he got himself says fear not those that can kill the flesh\nBut he can kill the spirit\nGum heat me and my brother's gum he want to know uh\nDon't brag about stand your you surely oh nutrition and your line
