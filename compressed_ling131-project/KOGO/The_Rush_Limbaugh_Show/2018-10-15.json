I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important or turn on our lives and it's like it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now in the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing if you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of\nThe election is uh the the drive by have their formula and it's rooted\nIn the desire they haven't everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the results of polling data and since the media is so hates Trump they want everybody else to\nTherefore the transition pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling David because people have a wake up and realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patriots hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I say just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in the history of landslides the Democrat Party deserves to get bombed\n\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then a decent world and in a sand society they would be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nI mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but we don't really teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done the hostage and yet they shot hostile sounds hot he always hassled the way they treat us\nPut somebody in dealing with in my head in this country for so many years I Am willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like they don't let her side\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but it's just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so it's this is confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nDot com well Saturday Adam ...

one and a half dozen varieties not so much a celebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses\nTV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is that just another sample from last night\nTrump and Leslie saw\nIs that you know General Mattis said tails the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in states prevent World War three now it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know my aunts and my answer is this I Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage\nOf like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and pulling for natural\nYes shipments explosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice is sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO Trump already called her out on it for doing this\nThe Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians about Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can't sneak up on people any more particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got at the roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I played golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell him about my opinion is that the media he\nSaid to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said and I I think\nComprised thirty and a half percent of taxpayers the top one percent comprise thirty seven percent of taxpayers so the top one percent of we're we're we're not talking all that many\nPeople were not talking about millions appear people hear\nIt in other words the end and the top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of total individual income tax so in other words the bottom fifty percent pay three percent\nThere isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes and yet how often do you hear every ... both parties\nPoliticians running around and we're going to middle class tax cut in the middle class pregnant burn is through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut the anymore when it comes to income taxes\nNow which small percentile of taxpayers also paid three percent or more\nIt's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone paid free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty little round that to fourteen hundred and fourteen hundred tax payers paid more\nThan the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one and the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent of the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing it is not true to say they are not paying their fair share\nNow this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay it plus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more\nIs actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for\nGene hungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair it is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it gets a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever going to change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to have so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share in taxes were going to ... and so the bottom Seventy physical yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid

going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here is my educated guess okay other than a warm serotonin flash of happy hormone imaginary headlines and black ... black or they're Obama Cuomo said\nWhat other kind of racist thoughts as Trump may be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the racist here the son of Mario the pious who sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not president even when he cannot\nPinpointed\nAt my house in an educated guess of the critical moment thinking that you're going to guess here in an hors ... west ... speaking Trump is thinking this is great this is great disguise blacker than Obama this guy's on my side just guys going to do wonders for me how does he know what's going on and Trump said\nThey have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist\nI this is the kind of think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it but I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him it befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall we were up here at number oh this is a big number three\nThis is Trump talking about the necessity of\nConsequences for illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their\nParents at the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it went on the books by painted and enforce hang on for them [laughter]\nYou know that the zero tolerance policy [noise] terror families with tonality then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to porn talk console you gonna go back to that Adam is less is\nLeslie for coming into our country illegally and part of\n... I mean part of the reason that I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states to get my fault\nLeslie I've done such a great job and the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now she says she misspoke there\nThis law on the ... Obama certainly didn't for separation of just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama dead at dinner had to be good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nOnce they see it was on the books but he didn't force\nIs that what you\nMean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump begins enforcing but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely Rona law or just enacted one that separate they don't run from their family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and\nOrder in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole premise some guy keeping abandon kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat\nOf a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families whether it's a law that he inherited I've looked at explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally it has to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids were put in much better surroundings and Sanders wild their uh their family their their their adult\nParents cases are being adjudicated there's nothing\nNothing I mean this is the United states of America we do not due to kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more honest me or\nThat the Democrats on the left of engaged in and Trump does not backed down from it and even as I say for writing magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next\nShe says do you think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose\nMillions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland watch these huge chunks

and sexual assault allegations involving Brett Kavanaugh five Republicans with close ties to the White House\nSaid that instead of preparing for what could be a years long attack by a newly embolden Democrat run Congress Trump aides are wasting time trying to respond to nonstop controversies Trump tweets and the investigation into Russian interference in the twenties sixteen election\nTheir story says that the White House should be hiring more staff to handle a congressional inquiries advising administration officials to retain their own lawyers and researching potential areas of vulnerability ranging from the death of four soldiers in Africa to the sluggish response\nTo Hurricane Maria according to people who worked for Presidents Clinton Bush and Barack Hussein oh [noise] now\nAt first glance you would think that this is a story that Trump and his buddies are not aware of the show lacking they're going to take in three weeks that they are\nBlissfully on aware that they're going to lose the house maybe lose the Senate\nThis story focuses on what's gonna happen if that happens and to that extent this story under cells what is going to happen if the Democrats gained control of the house if the Democrats game control of the house\nEvery investigation into the deep state and the scandal involving\nHillary in her emails and the ... the spying on the Trump and all of that stops\nNo answers will be forthcoming no punishment to those involved they will get away with it\n\nAnd that's just the first thing\n\nVirtually every thing Donald Trump has achieved will be rolled back\nThey will do their best to reinstitute tax increases you know what I'm going to prepare a list of things this might actually make a good ... I was talking about this is the first the artist might make a good\nUm illustration of what's gonna happen if the Democrats win it's not just the Democrats gaming control and by the way it's not just\nThis story focuses on Trump and his buddies are not yet prepared that they're not aware that they're not focusing on that the Democrats are gonna come investigate Trump and everybody associated with him that's going to happen and I can't believe companies people aren't aware of that\n\nUh I think it's my Trump's doing for rallies all week\nI think that's why Trump is working harder than any Republican at this moment to keep the Republicans in control of the house in the Senate\nIdea Trump doesn't get what's in the door if if if if this happens but specifically aside from all those things that they're going to aim at Trump the policy initiatives that have led to this great rebound and recovering economy is going to be brought to a screeching halt smokes\n\nYou can say goodbye Trump these trade deals that Trump is they're going to start working on on doing everything Trump did at the same time paralyzing the remaining two years of the Trump Administration in terms of what he is never going to get another judge confirmed any court any court anywhere\nNot a single one the talk will be we can't confirm a judge nominated by a guy who may be impeached we can't confirm a judge\nBy a guy who's not even going to be reelected in twenty twenty we can't do any of that in fact we've got to prepare by unraveling everything this man has done and they're going to portray this as a dangerous twilight zone two years apart were for the American people\nIt's\nIt's gonna be it's going to be brutal and you know when it's ... it's going to be what would have happened if Hillary

his campaign his presidency stop and think of all the things we wouldn't even know\nIf Hillary had one\nRental Lynch would be on the Supreme Court probably a Lois Lerner might be running the IRS or take your pick Koskinen wouldn't go anywhere\n\nStruck stroke Lisa Page McCabe all these people still be at the FBI\nCalling me\nWell Hillary might have gotten rid of him she hated him she was blamed it but but call me might have been the only sacrificial lamb fusion GPS would've become major players need ministry ration during opposition research on any opponent to Hillary and by the way any opponents of Hillary or the Democrats would be targeted as Trump was\n\nIt's going to be brutal let me get back to the audio soundbites oh it's the one more thing about this poll the headline Republicans worry trumpet his aides have no idea what the hell no idea the held that may away what does this may business it is is there is no you're not sure you're going to win\n\nThe White House is
