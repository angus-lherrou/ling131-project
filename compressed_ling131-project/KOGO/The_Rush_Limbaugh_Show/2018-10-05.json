transfer America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist back\nLook and there's a poll out here today this is the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials\nIdentify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taken a [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the ground as to what you see [noise] even though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen\nFor this millennial men were far more likely to identify of some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo socialism Congress on how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets the the masculine as they should have men and they've been

... men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant\nAnd it's just the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism\nIt's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be the limits in most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just slapping

Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nNow however that rush a good to talk with you I'm this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person they contacted 'em as Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony ...\nUh she she's the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how are those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle it polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in mainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press\nPeople have not heard either a blood\nAnd there's other things like for example or Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean in her and the testimony she goes she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this moniker McLean\nCorrect yes absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when\nAnd when ... Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with my client yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering if not the Democratic oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nIt's\nGoing to go through at the last minute chain where people are saying they're going to vote changes it is currently it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nAnd it's not about to come out that's the whole point you\nKnow it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference that end Grassley said there's a lot more\n... men are acting like they're having won\nBut you're not supposed to say these kinds of things\n\nYou know you were you what Trump allude in any way to women this time of the month and all hell is going to break loose\nBut here ms Rubin gets to talk about it as Lawrence common and every day and everybody gets everybody understands it and everybody knows what it means it means to stay away leave it alone don't engage yes ma'am yes ma'am three bucks for whatever and go on\nShe said many minutes\nBy alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has\nUm I've never seen him this animate I've never seen the turtle is animated this week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley sent his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to show him or you might have sent it to Feinstein and in this wider he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by E N Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grassland his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you will surely wouldn't produce it as quickly as you could\nBut you have repeatedly reviews to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucially Dr Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence but the the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls the Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWell her warriors did and that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed elect attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nSome reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce it\nAnd grass and they say you must be you must have something to hide that and he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy knowledge the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweat neck of the representatives what what what grass is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them they are how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her whatever\nI mean he's loaded for bear this is the kind of college out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is a kind of decorum that you you don't see broken\nSenators don't challenge each other they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't intend to the Senate or are they the media people\nAs [noise]\nUsing by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here and this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason

people at every restaurant where you can find\nA cabinet member they coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened\nTo judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to\nConfirm judges Kevin on the floor\nThat was during his ah southern for remarks today in favor of capital he was even singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule\nAnd that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\n\nI may have to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got\nAn email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election

that we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked Feinstein's wardrobe on a particular day of hearings but\nGo ahead Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental ... there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally wasn't Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a pain to look on her face Feinstein looks like she is where the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand up she got her cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein leaning in to Murkowski\n\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the dental camp do you see\nThe pain expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of die for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it

see [noise] Marsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is Phil Bredesen\nAnd\nBreathe is and he's saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn what is a Democrat and doing\nSaying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh this is in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to losing ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is ... seats And Corker by the way he was also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody you haven't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose the actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody we are going to design a seat on the court because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperate temperament and we're going to deny because they committed perjury and I've been going to deny it because if your eyes at a bar\nBack when he was in college but Corker made it plain that he doesn't think\nKevin or shouldn't be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action argue but when one of the world are we going to be punishing people here
