which had pictures of Trump and the presidential seal plastered to a window\n[noise] um [noise]\nI also have something sense to me here said that he was um I'm from Avon\nTour a and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty\nTwo ah income information pending what does this site can't tell what the site is it it's um [noise]\nAny weight identified as soon as a member of the Green Party a yeah he's got pictures of Trump and he's a GOP stickers all over the uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference waited for two thirty\nThis afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory\nBooker the New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients today all saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them blow 'em up because\nThey might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to them is still a lot that isn't known here\nAnd a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this is everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd until a law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to\nBelieve the first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concern that the media without waiting just went ahead and assigned this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy identifying the\nPeople as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh the narrative if you will drive by attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nAre matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we ever GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so the drive buys are reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is they didn't come in at the at the British in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector\nIs taking a bath specifically Google also all those alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still truck getting right along with the drive laws are reporting the day\nThat it has slowed down there could be trouble on the horizon\nAnd then there is this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that had been created but apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today\nAbout the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and that the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly swallows news is not talking\nAh as it becomes available now as we're learning this morning officials have now identified the male bombing suspect direct a arrested in connection to the suspicious packages or they've identified him as Caesar ... junior it's a fifty six year old man from the floor now\nI just outside of Miami they confirmed that he at one point lived in New York but it's unclear if the exact location\nI science junior said to have had ... a previous criminal records and officials are expected to release the charges he's facing that's coming at a press conference at eleven thirty today so we will also run that live right now we're just waiting on the president\nTo speak on this arrest\nNow in other news today a man is dead after trying to cross the five and national city it happened just before eight thirty last night with that man was walking on the off ramp he was hit by a car that hit by another car and dragged several the police have not yet

cannot have and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nI've just concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspect\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service the department of justice the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York the NYPD and all law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people have worked so hard and to have done it so quickly\nIt's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate [noise]\n\n\nWhat a bottom line is that Americans must unify and we must show the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens\nThere is no country like our countries and every day we are showing the world just how truly great we are so you are really very special people I wanted to say that before our little talk\nAnd I appreciate the time you've given me and boy one on one day one of you is going to be standing it could be three or four of you actually\nThis is without the ... are you listening to President Trump at the White House making remarks about the arrest of that man in connection with the sending and mailing of twelve suspected pipe bombs to leading Democrats\nAround the cut rate more now on this continuing coverage with Rush Limbaugh news ready to go six hundred Kogan and\nI have a lot of data you know is a highly influential a major media figure I Am all kinds of people trying to influence me with what I'm saying flooding lose on with things they want me to repeat\nA now say the Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines but they're calling him Native American\nI and again I'm Wondering is only here with the with the information for you that as as Irish David [noise] um and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind that you watch

ourselves he's got a big powwow headed up there and\nWe showed it for the media thank you very much I thought I'd do that and uh we feel very strongly a again congratulations to all law enforcement who have the best in the world and they just showed it thank you very much\nFor young black leaders of the White House [noise]\nTo the subject at hand\nTo be with so many brilliant and that's what you are brittian courageous and proud of them are so let's blow up\nOut of this because you know getting on to this the the real meaning the reason for the meeting there which is unprecedented by the way it's a leadership committee or hundreds of young black leaders are in America that are gathering at the White House has been a lot of ... about this\nI guess the president made and acknowledgement to law enforcement for their great work and tracking down the bomber and\nBringing that story to what to a conclusion\nAnd we were rolling on it and whatever he said that was relevant we will pass that I'll say I want to grab the phones get started there it's open line friday and I know you want to weigh in on this ah so are we going to start a just as if we have the ability you don't have the ability to give them\nOkay Jimmy in Omaha Nebraska we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jimmy and all my heart rate to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory about you I'm and I'm going to say in advance\nI had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I become so cynical or the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of each day\nAnd I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there is no red ... I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\nAnd I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\n[noise] and I think the the I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say between ... between these crazy right these these nationalist right groups planting bombs on the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the wind and the selection for the for the Republicans\nAnd I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nWhat do you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose they're not going to win the house back Democrats than than they've stayed thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws or that they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean I like I said rush three years ago I would've said I'm Crazy well I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nTo sixty so have the new balance Cardiff located at the corner of Birmingham in New castle defined your perfect fit with all the new head to toe\nArrives smarter\nSan Diego's morning news week days five deny news radio six on\n\n\nReadings welcome back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal\nThe Alexandria, Virginia this is Tammy Ron open line friday welcome great to have you with us high\nOh my God what a privilege I could imagine if I can imagine at the very much for me to have you here too so what shaking\n[laughter] um well I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was quite a few for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted\nAnd I loved that pedigree look at where you come from you come for you you have a federal judge was working and that's who recommend that you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree that's a that's a like a great resume that we've got you into the Institute\nAnd by the way I recently gave them a gift of a twenty four seven subscription [laughter] I'm so I'm sure he's listening today\nOh that's awesome that that is that what I Can't tell me how sweet that is you know what\nYou bring that up I have to tell you we we we are ... I don't know how to say this other than to say it we are continuing to\nSet records with the size of membership at Rush Limbaugh dot com it continues to blow my mind pleasantly so\nUm we don't know if it's just it's great people are signing up left and right it tells me how crucially important to people think these times are\nAnd where would you would think that the record high would be shortly after we introduced at some twenty five years ago Twenty years ago but no man any assistance is rolling and people like you make it all happened by giving away subscription I Can't thank you enough\nWell it's a good product right now you're willing to spend money on it but I wanted to ask you ask the question of case that on his comment yesterday about the caravan yeah I\nI Know how lucky I Am to be born in ... I have compassion for oh people all over the world we live in poverty who live under a horrible condition\nBut it it kind of the world's population live on less than ten dollars per day fifty percent that I'm less than two dollars and fifty cents a day so my question is are we obligated to let all of them and to the u._s. um art to deport them all with us tax dollars\nAnd it's not how do we choose who to give the gift of coming into the U.S and he's a trick question\nI'd like to suggest that we have an answer for that and it's called the legal immigration which is the only way to make that choice\nHere here exactly right the way we have always done it you know getting into this\nCountry under legal circumstances has always been a privilege it's always been an honor its always required some effort you have to learn about America you you have to want to be an American\nNow as for governor case that I don't think governor Casey was advocating for anybody in poverty around the world being led into America that's not what he was doing\nHe was simply trying to advertise the size of his heart to I think governor case it is still one of these people\nThat thinks Donald Trump has destroyed the Republican Party and the things governor case that cares about\nThe governor case it once everybody you know hey you know I saw big heart I look at these people that are down trodden a disadvantage that I still love 'em and I still care about about I don't think all of them and we've got to be able to put ourselves in a in in their shoes and understand he he just want everybody to understand that he has a caring\nFought for compassionate person as opposed to this bunk and he thinks is in the White House\nAnd uh 'cause he clearly not advocating for every one of the lead in the country\nThat's a ... it's not possible number one um and and would never happen so that's not his uh his real objective anyone I'm so glad you called Tammy thank you again have to take a brief time out of time is racing on stick\nWith us all the way already so bring it up to ... be poor\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure it\nNow I I don't know that any of my thoughts here a minute thing obviously I'm just sharing with us some of the thoughts that I've had that I and I ... process but you know I just didn't work these out when I first started noticing this stuff\nBut let me go to audio soundbite number twenty six we have there there is a CNN sucks sticker on those bands [noise]\n[laughter]\nHe goes to a post office kiosks whereabouts are cameras\nTo mail these these bombs none of them went off and from what I'm told for reliable law enforcement none of them could help now there's also a story out there that some of them are so unstable that law enforcement Heather detonate them rather than the transport them into the FBI lab in\nQuantico, Virginia you know these watches excuse me so I have to I'm OK I'm OK I did not fall you know these new watches have fall detectors not\nMeaning if you fall if the watch the tech ... that you have fallen it will offer to call emergency services for you if you're incapacitated all you have to do is do nothing if you do nothing after a certain number ... it'll call\nUs a call nine one one where you are it also gives you the opportunity so no I didn't fall I'm fine I'm OK this thing goes off on me twice show while I'm sitting here\nMy wild Jess ... my expression field manner of speaking as drinking my watch triggering my watching the thinking that I Am calling and I can't get up\nGet starts vibrating not you know what this is a great health feature that a lot of people are buying this watch for grandma and grandpa because it does\nIt work they've ... they've tested this watch on Hollywood stumped actors and ... men and women and it works but it's also it shows it nothing wrong with is comes back with false positives\nBut I'm my my hand than even hit the table at the end it just wildly just sticky waving around to her in my fall alert has been triggered him to watch that's what [noise] just interrupted me but my my point is this guy\nHere has been screaming notice me and now here comes Dana Bash from CNN justice after the CNN sucks sticker on this man [noise]\nCNN sucks [noise]\nHere we go that image CNN sucks course the president and direct that's he's not technically of responsible for that but in responsible for not just allowing the chat than on south at his rallies joking\nMaking clear the single life and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for ten years\nOne may have emerged and that is the danger and that is a reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you can have political discourse but when you've crossed the line\nIt is extremely dangerous and that has what has been giant on mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs\nAnd you know in a in a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist mediate is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except the theory is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crackpot CNN and viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about\nLetting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely for ... ... people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN can damning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump ... this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there is just what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard ball you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people are seeing her find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless lay as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our\nIssues they have lied about them is dated them is characterize them they attempt to do with ... and the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun in a bullet there is no wringing its hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to ...\nA lot of people said but Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is turkey perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam\nFrom having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted\nTo decorate and dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable\nIf you went to this is going to happen maybe before this program is over there is going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox\nIn a call Trump total front calling for unity winning e is responsible for\nAll of the chaos and division they will say that Trump was on believable a brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the old Limbaugh the room the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which for rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portrayed himself as\nOn involves getting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up [noise] um

there is enough information to glean simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today and you add that\nTo what you know or I think you know about all of the various political players involved here\nAnd do you think for example that the the deep state not ... the Democratic party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous\nWhat has been done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanning spies and the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia that Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate\nThat project is still ongoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was no guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned that in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Waller\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign you never met Trump and never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was hounding Trump or your advice or choose obviously goes out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign and stuff and help her\nHe was introduced a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea he drugs do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that stuff on August twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London and ambassador to step in not just\nYou know I told the we we know that the Russians have what was your\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head he didn't know it independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the best to go get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back\nWe don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have and entitlements to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to we can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years ... who\nThey are held back that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever find out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue\nNobody will ever know what really happened these people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wit and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to
