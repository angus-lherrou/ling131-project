into this country back to greatness as he's lost donors\nAllowed on airplanes as though anybody had to be told but I just I I Want to join everybody here I'm a people stature all over America\nAre issuing statements today condemning the use of bombs for any purpose whatsoever and we here at the E R B network heartily\nAnd energetically endorse the premise that we oppose bombs for any purpose whatsoever [noise] ah in domestic politics or what have the only time we support bombs is during warfare\nA declared hostilities warfare but bombs in politics or caravans wrote we hardly\nWe hardly condemn this dastardly action\nAnd wouldn't no way encourage it or support so just to have it on the record that's my official statement yeah should release this in writing\nTo I'm just ... get it to make sure that we here at the number are included in the list of people condemn 'cause I don't want to be on the list of people who support\nAre ... are there any is there a list of people's support bombs that that is going out there yeah I think the list is only people who condemn them right uh we want to make sure we are on their ... that list we don't want there to be any doubt\n[noise] that we condemn the mom okay so suspicious packages slash bombs that did not go off\nHad been sent to Democrats before the mid term elections\nIs it real or is it a political set up\nIs it a political stunt and if it is who's behind if it's a political stunt who's behind it and for what purpose I've seen some people today who think the Republicans are behind this to try to scare Democrats away from going to the polls\nThat's a new one on me that just doesn't compute that that's not the kind of thing Republicans do in fact\nYou remember when Steve ... got shot by a deranged Democrat at congressional baseball practice you know what our side said\nWe did not make a political the Republicans in Congress said this speaks to all of us we join everybody in condemning there's the Republicans did not attempt to make that part is in any way or to try to make hay out of it I'm not kidding go back and look at it if you've forgotten is\nThe Republicans did not make a point of singling out the guy as a Democrat and condemning the Democrats as essentially said that this is about all of us Republicans just don't have a behavioral history\nLike this so it was a political staunch who is behind it and for what purpose\nWhile the cabinet thing was a set up but it looked real for a while the Kevin off thing was a set up from the get go we of course here at the E R B network knew that\nAbout a lot of people thought it was real on ... it was exposed as a fraud the Democrats couldn't covered their bases long enough\nTo what\nTo pull that off Hillary Clinton rumored to run for president just before her certain to be prime I intended national tour with her husband\nWe have a massive land force invasion heading toward our southern border meant for a confrontation just before election day\nWhat if there are leaks from Mahler about his report before the elections political stunts or not\n[noise] would\nMahler in the media really do that look what happened to the FBI in two thousand sixteen they tried to fix it election for a Democrat they tried to screw a Republican out of the election and to\nMe these are all things don't we know and it wasn't just a handful of rogue FBI agents involved it was the top tier leadership\nThe one thing that we know to be true that Democrats are pulling out all the stops they see this election as their last best chance to take down Trump and his agenda\nIt's October [noise] another way of looking at this\nFor the last few weeks the Democrats have had all of that horrible PR all of these angry mobs and I don't care what anybody thinks\nThose angry moms are not good for the Democratic party those angry mobs are not going to stop turnout those angry mobs are not sending a signal joined us\nMuch as the media would like to portray about her was and much of the Democrats would like to portray of otherwise the people in this country do not want to spend all day and all night every day enraged and angry\nThat's not what life is to most people and they don't want it to be that but that's what life is where your average Democrat today enraged angry upset certainly unhappy\nNot content\nAnd they're hoping to win elections based on that there hasn't been a single that I've heard a single statement of condemnation for any of these acts\nCommitted against Republicans by Democrat mobs people who have been caught on tape threatening Republicans' in restaurants\nPeople who I've been caught on tape for ... named Republicans at airports\nRepublican office\nBombs are discovered\nAs the day goes on a fairly police

I'm\nParaphrasing 'cause I didn't hear the whole thing but she was going on and on a lot about is\nHorrible terrible but we've got to come together\nWe got I got together and she said the way to do with that is still well what candidates that can bring us together\nAnd of course that means Democrats so you're ... by the way the bomb that was sent to the Clintons and Obama never got to their homes just F why we still condemning them don't misunderstand the bombs were intercepted by the\nPostal service at one of the distribution centers so they were discovered very quick into bomb that\nWas sent to CNN didn't even get sent to the right place\nIn terms of where people work at CNN and it was addressed and John Brennan a who doesn't even work at CNN he was over at at a at MSNBC so a\nHillary Clinton right on schedule is now out reacting to this [noise] putting on his face of bravery and courage she is willing to be subjected to attacks like this because America is worth that kind of things\nAnd that you got to make sure they get out there and vote for the right candidates who are going to bring this to a screeching halt\nArms Mrs Clinton it's your party forgive me that is encouraging this kind of saying it is the Democrat Party that's home to all of these mobs it's the Democratic party Mrs Clinton herself who said that being on civil\nAt this point in time is entirely proper and understandable it's time to go back to the village he will be after the Democrats when\nYou've got bought and paid for operatives by Mrs Clinton money showing up at Trump rallies trying to make them look like deranged Trump supporters the Democrats are even paying people\nTo ... to to to address swastikas on American flags waving him around\nMade to look like I'm a deranged lunatic Trump supporters and so in the midst of this\nAtmosphere we have this series of bombs that were supposedly sent today explosively to Democrats and it just there's a smell test that this stuff has to pass\nAnd so far a lot of people's noses are in the air not quite certain what to make this uh this is just it's it's it's not it's not Republicans that show up for example\nAt the offices of the family or what what is it uh well the pro life groups offices some guy shows up with a gun and was going to shoot people got caught before he was able to shoot at family Family Research center I think yeah Republicans just don't do this kind of thing even though every event like\nMass shootings remember every mass shooting there is a Democrats in the media to try to make everybody think right off the bat that some\nTea Party or did it or some talk radio fan David or some Fox News viewer did it turns out it's never ever the case [noise] not one of these bombs went off\nAnd if a Democrat operatives purpose here is to make it look like hey you know there are mobs everywhere to the moms are not just Democrats mobs I mean look at this you got people here trying to trying to harm CNN\nAnd Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton and Debbie ... show\nYou know it just it it it might serve a purpose here\nAt the end by the way I guess what's also is not in the news now and that's the that's the other mob\nThat's finding its way north through may call attempting to crash the U.S border at or near election day that story is off and I'll tell ya there's another story and it's not being covered right down that is the declining blue wave\nThat was supposedly automatic and going to happen a week ago at a month ago but we're not going to let this side track us\nWe are not going to be distracted there's only so much you can say about this incident until we have more information about\nSpeculating would be fun but since we can damage all bombs here at the ... network we don't want to go too far down this road\nI Do know that people want to weigh in it or wait in on it on the phones and we'll get some of that in right now starting in Atlanta this is Tanya and you are first up with is how

be apprehended and we will find out who they are where they are why they did it\nWho paid them or if they were not paid\nThe simple fact remains Democrats in America are at risk\nTo save them to protect them vote against them\nA public service announcement from me your host Rush Limbaugh and the E R I beat him\nNow the uh the bomb here as the bombs it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise] I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing to show me right\nSo Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill showing and come back here and they started sending out bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn aide to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy rains is is [noise] I mean [noise] the elevator doesn't go to the top floor [noise] like to say is an order of fries short of a happy\nMeal\nWhy would someone smart enough to make a functioning mail bombs actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\nAnd ... and and so close to one of my chin what kind of food do something like this\n\nIf a smart bomb maker [laughter]\nIf somebody really really good at making bombs have left\nThis much does he think\nThis is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise] um I actually think in all ... what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative\nAnd you've watched everything blow up on you you watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports\nThan at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans too that the words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that\nBackfired and ball leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of the worst that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side\nYou might want to do something to make it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it\n[noise] okay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday [noise]\nI'm ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average\nAll of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle\nSite real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of here\nAnd Tom ... all the polling data that they had a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five and a half so two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sleep every Republican away and leave only Democrats stamping\nThe generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past week cause of Trump neutralizing much of it [noise] [noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies continue\nNow another retired historian and political analyst sent an email that I received\nA lawsuit but I've been able to have it it was just this morning and I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them\nBut I just want to share with your some of the things I get some of the is by the way it legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me a into promoting whatever it is that I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passion Italy this guy who is in historian who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone just not as well known as he looks at things here is an absolute\nTrump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to beat curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge elite syringe\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls picked it up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before the bombs could it happen again it\nProbably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg says but it did in ... and it's going either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go and ... what what is this an decision all of a sudden\nVersus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nPolls couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be\nCorrect so they still have their reputations all of a sudden it could\nBe really really close much closer than we ever ever new it's a cycle and you

pogo\nGuy answering that question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a [noise]\nTwo thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they\nHave the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nSo no I mean how how many are the are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterms the Clinton now is Obama an obstacle and they know I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this uh Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour\nThird team locations stadium tour they're going to charge admission for people to come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what what if there isn't a\nWhole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons art anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state and Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phone it collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger their wife or the mirror here it's not safe that just it's just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time on\nThe phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Roger or there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father at the pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very much\nRussia you know it's a you talked about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by and on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail [noise] you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that how this will be owned by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is already George Soros\nHillary Clinton Iraq saying oh you know that that information out there for the masses to obtain now quite being there was never any country these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrat they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they want to do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something to do it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around would\nIt make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today\nAnd the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us but the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they
