fix\nWhatever problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument of the purpose of government\nIt really is used to take all of this that's happening domestically and then when you synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependents grown up in a mass thinking that government\nIs the solution and the solution is not really a solution the solution at

advocating one of the other I'm just I'm just saying that the modern NFL is somewhat reflective of the snowflake culture of today it's still a brutal game do not anybody misunderstand me but it isn't

I say go live local\nYou could be mega rich I'm Ted Garcia in cocoa new center and due to strong sales\nWhy are they doing it well if if you listen to any of the Democrats campaigning like Beto O'Rourke we have a soundbite coming up\nOur own buddies I kept campus reform when one on campus and found some people go to vote for Beto O'Rourke is it would you be surprised to learn that not a single person they ran into can tell them what a single Beto O'Rourke policy it\nDoesn't surprise you at all does it not not not when the media is promoting that whole as middle name Kennedy\nThey're promoting his good looks promoting the woman ... thing that promote well I mean if you're going to promote Kennedy got to promote it all I'm not accusing a bet on that but if you're going to say hey I'm just like the Kennedys then you've got to be just like the Kennedys stay away from sixty nine Oldsmobile Z\nOn bridges but I mean ... not a single person voting for Beto can tell you one of these issues because it doesn't matter\nAnd in many of these other places that Democrats are running on issues that are not at the forefront of people's minds or they are on the wrong side\nBut if you're really stop to think about it mob\nBehavior bullying the appearance of insane rage and anger is all they have left they don't have any issues or policies to run on for the same old reason they can't be honest\nAll they've got plenty of policies all day got plenty issues\nAll they have plenty of ideas they just don't dare tell anybody what they are\nNot at the run up to election time\nThey have no leaders to rally behind me look at the presidential front runners of this party\nJoe bite me\nCrazy Bernie who is losing popularity and if you haven't heard Hillary Clinton has all but made it official she's running again in twenty twenty\n\nHillary Clinton me a two time loser wants to go for the trifecta and I'm telling you there are a lot of people in the Democratic party hierarchy particularly in the media who don't want her anywhere near a presidential campaign again\nKamala Harris big walk by the time the microscopes get through her we're going to find out how really\nIntellectually vacant that woman actually is and the same\nThing with Cory Spartacus Booker these people survive on an image and reputation built by the drive by media but when the time comes to find out what really goes on between their ears you learn that it isn't much\nThey're frustrated because they've tried everything they tend to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has\nThrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with fatal here\nThey have failed in every ... every effort to get\nDonald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and forties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven\n\nAnd the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how the drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get\nRid of Donald Trump and yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about is simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump removed from office since the day after the election I guess what ... about that is what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making it\nAce for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box in twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the arranged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed\nThey've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road\nDay how many times they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not fifth say they want him out of office every day now the failure compounds the rage\nLook at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks and in particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward\nThat was a tool for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem that's what they were trying to do\nChristie in Boise for Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero\nTo the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then towers in as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes\nThat was an issue that was after investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead how about\nThe shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the under ... how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and where\nIs he now and where is the issue of gun control where is this story and that young people\nHigh school and college students that had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus of government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the in Iraq where\nIs that the day what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issues\nBased on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real when are you man Russia's ... he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience Damon ... did not literally create a bond neither does okay seal Cortez these people do not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump has are like other successful people immediate do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real like\n... gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hog we may want to see if nobody's saying where's hogging\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is none of this is real it's all soap operas script material what's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton is affecting late killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did anything wrong with Monica Lewinsky she was an adult she wasn't consenting adults jihad ... she was a consenting adults I Know what was\nIt not abuse because Bill Clinton knew that she was an adult\nWell bye-bye me too movement\nI mean if the ... that random bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women\nClaiming her husband abused them comes up not to defend her\nGuy what good as the me too movement\nI have it's not on

wants this to happen\nI'm trying to figure out how this caravan let's say they get to the border and storm the border and just run across with how they think that helps the Democrats unless it's just the pictures of chaos they think they're going to redound negatively the Trump anyway\nOkay I Walk I promise I promise soundbites and your phone calls are coming up after this break I\nNews radio six

right after the news at noon it's all happening right here on news radio six hundred coal though [noise]\n\n[noise] that's right that's right the course of course we're back\nOpen line friday Rush Limbaugh to Springfield, Illinois Todd ... thank you sir Hi\nRush hour today sir no good really good work do you remember when you have to take cell phones up front because they cost much do you\nUh when I used to take cell phones or ... what do you mean\nYou would you put them at the top of the line because it costs so much for oh yeah\nOh yeah we that's right because we ... we the eight hundred number didn't apply their cell phones cell phone caller had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way way back that up are you back you go I\nI've been way back before that even fell a but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nLast two years there's only one thing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done this at this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize that Trump is not the winter that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought that it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get don't call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon Trump do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these are one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nIt's not so are you are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their\nNext year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say that these are smarter than than I Am\nA maybe but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding lose own\nWith four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump pass a bill for walled Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOh I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them will what\nMy question is what else do they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh\nWell that's exactly right and\nRight there that the store and the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want but it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I didn't even start so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just\nKeep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all up you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget deals we've\nHad continuing resolutions um we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against\nAnd I'm ... before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that wall\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors in the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[laughter] they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's a lot of other\nThings that they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted them a into doing what he wants\nOut and many of the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea of the Trump was going to be ongoing or a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise]\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side but\nWe'll see if this story on the caravan turning around palm pay or is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having that when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince either floated may call\nOther people investing other industries individuals investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars are Petro dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places in other countries as well and part and parcel of his reform is the\nI don't know what word abandonment origami a distancing from ...\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\n\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to ... again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want while habits of watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin among represents a bit of that it's fascinating that he has been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith the death of shaggy this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wondered well who determines but these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives\nSo a Saudi king can have twenty sons\nHow do you determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines\nThe winning edge of the crown prince the heirs and in what order then saw him on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current\nKing Solomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says it the widow if it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as ground friends\nKnow many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what your his sons is gonna be the next king but it's not the case so all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cabin up all these plans for reform\nHave been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of democracy show in Turkey which is also very unhappy with Saudi

Trump\nTo show Trump's ineffectiveness or to show Trump is aligned with tyrants or whatever I by the way I was thinking there is one issue\nThat the media and Democrats you have to say had some success and that was the allegation that the Trump Administration was separating children from their parents at the border that one had some legs that wouldn't work and that might be what this\nCaravan as about as a as well\nUh even though it was totally manufactured and made up it required the ignorance of a lot of people for it to a I don't mean stupidity\nIgnorance of a lot of

[laughter]\n\nI Am I going\nTo get to the production I may last night on hand today about the mid term elections and Fox them and asking people all day to react to it so that some of the soundbite we that we have coming up\nOther stuff here on the soundbite roster as well which I I thought I was little\nIs to demonstrate to Trump voters that despite all the talk he hasn't done a thing to stop illegal immigration\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory\nAnd then you add in the chaos that will happen then you throw in the possibilities if they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's the one of all those issues and I went through the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs when dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of mine was one of\nUs\nAnd it was during the times and Dr ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families\nFrom their mothers ads and this guy\nWho's up to speed on this stuff's just rush those pictures look past that come on you know the pictures are made up this is ... the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really for one for the rest of the pictures look bad we got to do some pictures Louis oh my gosh\nI I was the guy was smart enough to know that he was falling for a media trick\nBut at the pictures with what he was telling me was I Can't defend this I have people\nComplain to me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio sound as if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen and that are going to determine outcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew that\nBut there's four hundred and forty five of these things that I don't know I just rely on hope which was the gang naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been a ripe\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity so I this process if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a an savannah is Julie ... cohost out there talking to fame and Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment\nFans deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will add some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nWhere you are not buying into those are some of the holiday Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't count those flights I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seat there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats seats are in place for telling me on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through them and say this is stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally absent are there any any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired\nOutcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand six day and I mean that those people were literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win it Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any other way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nIn them [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to\nBe what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried that Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went on for like a lead the balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats has reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no polling shows that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so we were coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the

your ... your what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy they were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar people and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we didn't three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in her forties earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of a necessity I I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were\nThey were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I

think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I ...
