to have you with us on the program high\nThey did it was very thank you\nThanks for your program thanks for your common sense and not going across America\nBut it's it's a British network and the title it's six episode one hour per episode\nMiniseries called press and is about two competing newspapers in the current you're right in this modern day and it's amazing how on this it is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country\nIt is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small\nOne of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than ... trash and it's\nThe one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does its fight out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same\nPowerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the big people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the dumps its breaking the rules there has to be something air mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em\nOut and and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the biased well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes rebuilt\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people\nIn that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to\nThe early days of sixty minutes it was all about that and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watch this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is pick up all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years\nAnd he is totally on affected\nBy life\nTo him every body is a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides\nHis journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions and he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not particularly like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from one to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it went with it\nAnd the ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody he doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you would have to be if your job is destroying people no conscience the belief that everybody is law that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a

get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nTo run it and so the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of it is ...\nI have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the
