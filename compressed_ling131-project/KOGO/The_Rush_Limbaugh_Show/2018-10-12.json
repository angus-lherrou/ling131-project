climate change do people over north but\nJust rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy\nBecause while this guy is jumping all in my chili\nListened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserves what thank God because they support Republicans\nNow do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely deranged like this you know they're going to make up the fact\nThat a bunch of people like me who know or the climate change man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking\nTheir lives does University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham\nHe's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this guy was published in the guardian and not some obscure little rag\nOr penny saver this was published in the guardian on Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching at ease engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states\nWho voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity and manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane ever hit the panhandle\nYet he blames\nThe intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claim that southern voters brought this upon themselves by voting Republicans into office\n\nYou tell one or the other states like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio and his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction dissolve so this clown\nWho is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\n\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally there's one that's what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are tax on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the ...\n\nI mean this [laughter] if if it if it weren't so irresponsible it would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West and what Kanye West Dan is simply venture\nOff the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\n\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you now do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking\nThere were people\nIn the leftist medium who literally weren't trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nWhere as Democrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you can get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and sort of people out there saying that Bush actually won his or her and came to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have\nTo leave would have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing when he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\nWell\nI didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out\nThere talking maybe ... takes on the Internet who were claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was fearing the hurry and and what this guy is professor at the University of St Thomas's no different\nBy claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be\nAnd whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know\nYeah it's the redneck Riviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida and blow both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we looked at these events are these people do as one wants to political events some of these people who had been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with I mean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives or\nIt's just heartbreaking to see what happens and they only upside as it was not\nYou know a densely populated area but that doesn't change\nThe impact on the people who lived there ... there were some who didn't evacuate and I made up their minds themselves the media found them talk to them they wanted to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like every hurricane has\nThose people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious to hear how devastating and how big it how\nNews

have I doubt that he did [noise] I don't think this guy is probably ever laugh with his wife in Fifteen\nYears [noise] but that's just me speculating let me continue\nMy husband did not defend his remarks he did not defend the men he sat hunched and hurt and he listens to me for a moment it occurred to me to be grateful that I'm married to a man who will listen to a woman\nThe wins calmed ever so slightly and that moment when I realized he was okay and then the storm surge wound up at me as I realized empathetic and buttons of nice men's plan to rebuild the wreckage by listening to women\n[noise] guys you're really not hopeless this is this guy get anything right and he blew it\nHe listened to everything and his wife still well up and exploded because what he was doing there

haven't had occasion to play it recently but might revive it from the archives today just since you brought it up\nThat still hilarious beyond description of a I Hope of that for science degree what NPR graffiti and we used to talk about ah what is it the optimal kept when you hear of these uh people or the U.S and we're talking\nAbout well the climate change everything burning up oh they never tell us what the optimal temperature is a but every time the temperature goes up a few degrees\nLarge swaths of Canada Russia China that are it all on terrible turn into a better agricultural areas and we ended up feeling more people are case in point\nA mayor ten thousand years ago here enough to read west we have this giant oil a shirt sitting over most of the country\nAnd then this wonderful thing where the climate warmed up and we have this area that's suddenly feeding the world so every time the temperature goes up a\nLittle bit a way the more people so I don't know what the problem is I mean\nLike oh yeah she ... the problem is they're trying to scare everybody into signing on to this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing to the whole premise of climate change your dream to a lot you're agreeing you are to blame\nAnd that's a big one\nBecause when you agree that you are to blame then they hit you with but you can fix it you you you can make demands and how do you do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you you agreed to start criticizing everybody else\nSo they get you to accept blame then you also admit that gigantic\nOrganizations are the only way to structure our lives and to protect everybody so it's it's simply a waving guilt people into\nAccepting when they don't even know this is being done to them the premise of socialism communism\nUnder the guise of saving the planet but your point about the optimal temperature I've expressed that in a different way over the years how do we know folks that climate conditions right now in the entire\nHistory of this plan on how many hundreds of thousands of years whatever it is how do we know that the temperature and the climate right now\nIs optimal is perfect is what it should always be how do we know that we don't\nGet to the vanity obese people assuming that this is the bass line this is perfection anything that veers off from here is a problem

you\nDownload the free I hard with us today [noise]\nAnd I got\nSome emails rush that woman from Grinnell getting she's Seventy [noise] where does the woman that end [noise]\nWhere does she do learn that kind of have [noise]\nThink I have the answer\nI don't think that's hard at all [noise]\nHaven of left wing commune living answer and Palo Alto and then we learned that she is a professor she's a doctor of some kind of psychology at Palo Alto university well I have never heard of Paolo Alto university so I\nBegan to dig deep what is Paolo Alto university what do they do there\nAnd the short version of the story is it is a place run by women\n\nThey count themselves as a school that prepares women to become experts in the psychology\nTheir website\n... saw the wonderful things they can do for women and Seventy three percent of the faculty to students waiver are women never on their website is there a mention of seeking men about psychology so I concluded that this is a haven for women\n\nNow this this this professor here from uh ... university Victoria Bissell\n\nYeah I I Know women my age who grew up\nWith the Gloria Steinem ms magazine Betty for Dan version of militant feminism\n\nAnd back then it was basically about equal pay for equal work and not getting married and not letting demand defined your happiness or relationship a marriage or what have you\n[noise] but where do these women come up where do they get this hate I have a theory that it has to be it has to derive from the fact that a lot of its media\nI this particular woman published in the Washington Post\nProbably listen to NPR religiously probably read the New York times religiously probably watches CNN religiously\nAnd as a professor at a university\nThey are surrounded she is surrounded by other like\nMinded women\nThey feed on each other's bad experiences with men they retail and retail story after story after story\nAnd it's kinda like oh Kanye West said yesterday Kanye West said that\nIn groups of people where there isn't any male energy people are going to go nuts after awhile\nKanye West noted philosopher an Oval Office visitor made that point yesterday and I think that's where this comes from I think it hanging around with with the other angry politicized leftist women whatever\nAnger areas get\nRe told and retold and it becomes more and more intense than the ... this woman does not hide the average actor range the almost stung container bull anger even for her husband who she admits it's perfection\n\nThis the reason why this is Rob this is the American left folks this is the Democrat Party this is the group of people that thinks Hillary Clinton is the one where he is one of these women\nHillary Clinton is exactly one of these women\nRunning around filled with rage on controllable rage hatred an anger that is compressed and intensifying each and every\nDay and I'm telling you no matter what the drive by just think it's not infectious it does not make you want to join the team\nIt makes you think these people are not\nThat far out of the mainstream yet to them it is the main stream and this is not\nGoing to sit well this is not a good day for me to move but actually happened yesterday in New York judge drops sexual assault charge against\nHarvey Weinstein and we're not hearing much about this shockingly because Kanye West is eating up all the oxygen and the news bubble\nDisgraced movie mogul Harvey Wang's team has won last count a sexual assault being brought against him before his trial begins according to the Daily Beast\nOn Thursday morning a judge dismissed one of six criminal counts brought against the disgraced mogul by the Manhattan da ... ... ... Evans alleges that winds dean forced her to perform oral sex in two thousand four winds stands attorney Benjamin Brafman\nArgue that the charges be dismissed due to Evans previously describing the sex act to a witness has consensual\nA witness reportedly told this to the Y. P. D.\nSo Brafman sudden a press conference this is not about suggesting that a woman who comes forward should not be believed this was about a witness who came\nForward and committed perjury before a grand jury now wait a minute just to Brafman we're coming off the Kavanaugh hearings were we were told women can't lie and we were told that women don't lie and we were told that we're not to think women lie anyway and you are\nNow saying that a charge was dropped because a witness who came forward and committed perjury perjury before a grand jury\n\nDon't worry Harvey Weinstein Stiller creepy pervert out there still has five counts against\nHim but in this case he found somebody who was willing to sell in what he wanted\nAnd they reduced the five to six charges to five speaking of Hillary [noise] you know what I'm let me let me think of a soundbite rushed her real quick\nI have a feeling that we're going to have Hillary Clinton this is amazing by the way this has three cycling an\nOld\nStory that we have previously laughed at I Can't tell you how many what looks like okay good don't have it here no big deal\nHillary Clinton to Trump you asked Russia hacked me on national TV this is the most amazing thing and this story is another great illustration of the divide\nThat exist between saying an insane in this country\nAnd how the people on the insane side had literally no sense of humor have none no perception of what so ever of humor\n\nHillary Clinton fired back and President Trump yesterday after reclaimed a day earlier that Clinton had engaged in a conspiracy with Russia\nDuring Wednesday nights campaign rally in Pennsylvania Trump told the crowd there had been collusion and he said well if you look at it when you think of but there was collusion between Hillary and the Democrats in Russia there was collusion there was a lot of collusion with Russia and lots of other people by the way\nAnd he's right what he's talking about here is the Clinton campaign the Democratic National Committee hired fusion GPS founded by Glenn Sampson who's refusing subpoenas to testify to Congress claiming the Fifth Amendment\nFusion GPS took the money from the Clinton campaign the DNC\nAnd went to a law firm cut out called Perkins ... this was done to make Hillary and the DNC money look why they were buying a legal advice and campaign advice but\nThe law firms then funnel the money\nAfter laundering Christopher Steele and he then went out and created this lying stinking phony dot CA the one that has the story that Trump hired a bunch of prostitutes\nIn Moscow to urine aid on a bad that had been slept in Bible rock Hussein all and Michelle my bell oh\nThe ...\nIs is not a single bit of it has ever been corroborated like balls the foreign story not a single bit of corroborate ... no evidence whatsoever and yet that dot CA was used to get a finds that weren't the spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd that dot CA is what kicked off in a truth ... special counsel investigation and try to find collusion between Trump and Russia to many of his old knows but that's what Trump's for learning to and Trump is exactly right the collusion here between anybody in Russia is Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC\nAnd the route is Hillary Clinton DNC to I'm a fusion GPS then on to ... and then just deal with the money still got\nWent through a bunch of different layers before he got it but they essentially commissioned an opposition research hit piece on Trump that they tried to sell every body was legitimate Intel's Trump's what it is out\nHere what rate goes bananas she can't believe the truth is being told about her she can't believe that they can't let this day and so she has to Trump is the guy that as the rushes to heck me he did it on national TV Trump is the guy that he would and they have tried to make this case\nI it's the funniest thing in the world Trump was down in Miami his resort down there to route and this was a

engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump ...\nThe Democrats and blue wave is drying up oh that sounds great disappointments\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth team in terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely he'll Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we've\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling and people have been asked well how can this how can this disparity be how can you have\nA generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\n\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning\nThe ... in the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other seats if they have\n\nThey held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's [noise]\nLet me go state by state to show her and this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this is a\nTraditional here party out of power winds ... that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting the hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer\nNow ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanting to murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interest in in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that climate guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and more I see an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they wrote over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so the trick is how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in a\nMovie equals Hollywood how do you get stars and again people will start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed and how do you find in theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and\nViolence in the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt\nTo you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's\nNot the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics\nBut it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murder\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the room\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and this trial that was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your a moving target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so the way I looked\nAt it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass\nMurder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left abortion is not even human and some Bible tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified\nThe American media\nIs attempting here to blame Donald Trump is Donald Trump and his open disdain and criticism of the media\nIs said to have made Mohammed bin Salman comfortable with the fact that he can get away with murder and journalists because Donald Trump made him think it'd be okay this is what the American
