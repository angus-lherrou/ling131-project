and in fact they encourage it\nMaxine Waters is out there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was out there in your Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist is totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this dirt range psychological upset is tied to them\nWell let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death\nIt would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of Iran's lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all [noise] some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so up to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this\nWhen you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the middle [laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea\nOf what we don't know you ought to be your shoes are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh it was during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of that\nAction fade away on either or both\nSides of this and that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad in saying crazy percolating compounding come\nPressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election\nDay and the day after a two thousand sixteen then this ... situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical and I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean there are still talking about investigating Kevin off for under ... wants\nTo see the F. B. I. documents released\nShe wants a full fledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are barking at talking about Gerald ... House Judiciary committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're going to impeach cabin on they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up\nAnd motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what you and I wouldn't call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is and genuine child like I Know it's not even ... like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this uh anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a Democrat voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddle their funds all weekend long if they weren't being pay that I think the Democrat rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they were going to win that aren't they go to a landslide they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrats protesters they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats\nReally get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they couldn't be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not but for those that\nDon't get it it amazes me but it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of the ah the party\nAt large here's J Christian Adams writing is PJ Media Kavanaugh photos fills Senate gallery was sounds of being saying\nSo but it was any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my

as odd and on earth weight\nAs anything I ever heard in side a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning dude\nAnd then the role was called but it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting howling screaming\nIn an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was rage was hate\nIt was poison in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination and they weren't an embarrassment to\nThemselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to least bit concerned about it\nThe Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large it doesn't seem to worry at all this\nKind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think\nThat this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten the Republicans in tune not confronting them and basically letting them have their ... and they make us who wants to deal with

not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and longer we say constantly there's the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges rule on law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nNumbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past\nAs the laws in America they have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that that was forced\nOn the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out half of this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point what\nThey believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\n\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests it's the same\nReason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all\nThese years\nIf Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever would be they routinely\nSoft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexander the gift to task who's lunacy on display in a left his district of New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and besides you they're sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review\nThis every thing they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they show you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when bang and even the Republicans\nThink so a P has them Reuters has some\nNew York times CNN doesn't matter where you go there's always

leftist socialist communist agenda via the United States Congress\nThey can do it in their state legislatures I give you some places like California and so forth they haven't been able to do it nationwide it has to be for them and of course for that to work for the use of force to be working half the cave to it\nYou after it came to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened not\nWith people of white privilege so we heartily endorse the Babylon be anyone there for their points proves my point about humor and satire

Court justice thanks to Obama she has said it would not be good for him to be on the court\nIt would not be good too controversial the integrity of the court would come into question there's no question this is what the weather does\nThey lose control over an institution the institution lots in their minds is corrupt unreliable and must be eliminated from the power structure you're exactly

out of the womb being all over everybody female Dr nurses even his own mother and sure enough my son appears to be growing up to be a white guy see what you're saying is true in the white patriarchal power structure at work\nI Love the satirical reaction [noise] that's what the left is asking everybody [noise] their beliefs\nFolks I I'm I'm telling you these kids that have now become adults but maintain this adolescent\nDegree of range psychological disorders and what have you they have been taught this stuff and they really haven't been taught that the founding of America was one of the greatest injustices in the fall of humanity and the Emmy buddy other than white men\nAre victims\nAnd if you are a white woman happily in a relationship with a white man then you're part of the sound like you're part of the problem you're letting everybody down you are subordinate in yourself to the patriarchy for the\nBenefits that you get you get a relationship you get an income you'll get a nice house you got a family and so you are a sellout at I'm not exaggerating this is what they're teaching and this is what these young people believe\nThe audio soundbites we've talked about this woman before Rebecca Traister she was on C. span two on Saturday Saturday show called afterwards what does this she was running for attorney general or is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid that we've highlighted here and I forgot what it is but it's in the Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez vain and it just it just after nine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's an hour show archives but this is the first I think maybe we've had assigned by the hurt before but\nThis is an appearance about a book that she has written called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger and the host of this CSPAN afterwards show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\n\nQuestion if the devastating to me that if a white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nWhen you read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life for private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister are we\nAngry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white man and and if their power their products no power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nAnd then in fact this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white linen question at every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kevin ... and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kevin ... is that they were ... it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men they have sons they have brothers and anybody would have half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind\nTo see that the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were told not to lay guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable\nIn fact [noise]\nWe'll see there's actually a story with that exact point made here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kevin wrong\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it\nBecause he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball Z forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and sort of brothers and you're watching this\nA rush to begin to your show you are you at a record of a question about a dozen Democrats really believe in this this new tactic with the mob and I'm and the Democrats learning the urgency they become a political uncertainty and as you know within thirty the learn to feed\nIt they just change tactics and the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had to they had someone that not only educates argued\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp through cannot has put some ... on the spinal Republicans\nAre\n... true true ... but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to is\nWilling to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior\nWhich was widely publicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so\nThey got an elevators they shouted these people down to Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think the American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue\nCollar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely the that the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to a who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my ... I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my saying and just world the Democrats just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm a king book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this bunch of ... for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone\nThe Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case [noise] Democrats think they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election uh Democrats think the whole country is except they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied no I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event had happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around a lot of people\nI saw him on Fox say a lot of learned pungent commentators oh this was going to be so old by the end I actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yeah I just have to chuckle\nThan Democrats weren't enraged at the Supreme Court stopped the count in Florida of the hanging chads the Democrats believe that the Supreme Court Hamdan George W. Bush the victory ill legally\nNever mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here\nThe U.S Supreme Court heading to step in and stop it because it was out of control and when they did the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward George W. Bush was an illegitimate president\nAnd he didn't stop being illegitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the money's six years later in the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have\nTo pay that country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back and they\nAre going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and that Al Gore\nBeing duly recognizes the legitimate winner of the president's seat even though Al Gore didn't want any part of it by that time they were feeling so\nUp so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial honoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks [laughter] prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand two\nThe Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a store Paul lyrical rally\nThe purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone Republican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing it fully showed up\nAt the arena they did this arena in a place in whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people it was some time after a while most of them died in a plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was\nI don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial\nAnyway Republican senator is not knowing up from down as I'm Trent Lott into boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial a religious memorial ... there for one colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm boozy and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having arrived in sat down it was identical\nBut what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was democratic voters are going up to the worthy Republicans receded and getting in their faces and pointing fingers and I'm a booming at them they thought they were\nThere to participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left and this memorial turned\nInto a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial\nThis ... took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve and\nI remember I was invited as the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted\nAnd I went\nAnd I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they\nThey cycled other people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans had gained ... seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big because\nDemocrats told everybody hated Bush everybody of resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just like ... and the the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence\nAnd as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats to take back control of what is right probably there's Washington DC\nExcept it didn't happen to Republicans gained ... seats\nTim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said\nMemorial but Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why and the truncated RSS\nShould have what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president does elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's I like ... if it's happened once it can happen again\nSomething it hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if it has\nThen it can happen again and this is a replay of that\nExcept this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior but we'll still memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display for two full years\nAnd ask for longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public the arrangement public insanity\nPsychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too have sat in the Senate gallery as a young boy [noise]\nMy parents took my brother and me in Washington DC\nOne summer and the Senate was in session and I remember a Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill\nI was fourteen or Fifteen\n\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet or a book some some kind of a a manual explaining what the Senate was and what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed that book away from\nMe and said you are making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted the gallery could not do anything more than ...\nYou were not allowed to chew gum\nPeople were chewing gum and the pages said you're leaving Russia or putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it you're not staying here chewing gum\nThey would come which brings us to you\nThey took my little pamphlet a way\nI felt like they just stop all just come and then I'm watching this thing the other line these and these these these these\nWomen are going batty sounding literally\nLike they are in things out of the loan that and they don't want to be there and I couldn't even make out what they're saying\nIt sounded like Christian Adams said it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there and Tom Mike Pence was saying over\nAnd over the sergeant Yvonne I'm starting to learn to restore order and the gallery there's are done an arms will restore order and the gallery sergeant arms as having a hell of a lot of trouble restoring order in the gallery\nAs I said the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I.

I'm a turban on any number of them wouldn't even take a call from ... a member of their own party\nBut it's ... ... they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there because they
