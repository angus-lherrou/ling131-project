illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year end note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we've got Trump out there they claim he was mocking wealthy forty wasn't mocking or\nWhat guy I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is one of the acceptable I don't know why the president that he did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to before\nAll this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week it could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate of last week was not the time to do it so Trump joys of course I find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes and Trump just pointed out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge her because it just wasn't\nSmart especially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhat an odd been politically useful but in in a normal congressional hearings to many hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenges in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't\nStep and it it made it looked like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times it's been investigating the trumped for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit it was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia at ten for bats yet\nThey want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because in due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and then not able to find any Russian money\nActually or whatever is on somebody and James are or think mostly are too young to remember\nBottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman sort of political by\nNow what grams point there's there's a lot of young people in the audience just don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nHey you never know what you got to know when you're grabbing gotta do to try to walk like what you got to come up and get what you know like I'm going to come up with the women like New Hampshire gray the ... not a\nDemocrat and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted a a Republican senator and he pushed back this was\nThe attack or a confrontational walking down the hall or any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill\nAnd they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices in Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin Oh where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated Gerges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your life your son's life or your husband's wages to answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushback that it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor\nOh no no wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protests I Would fight and I would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protester no there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for less\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of southern like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them\nYou can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media [noise]

was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again\nTrump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump wasn't necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting orbit dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\n\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've founder compelling then as we learn more and then there's the vents play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him the credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord and what did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right to oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned what he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really\nThinks it's a pattern it's a technique it's a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation\nSenate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has established that after he makes that initial statement on something if he can make fun of things and what really irritates the left he gets away with it I cannot tell you\nHow it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lion flee insane [laughter] it has made the with rage other Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand and three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hit

psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for bad description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or The Revenge

group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened these people that capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people are so I have\nNo idea how to deal with this no idea whatsoever so we ended up in a debate
