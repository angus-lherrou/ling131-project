there\nAnd has gone\nFar I'm telling you foreign policy wonks is not getting any coverage is Kevin O's morphing everything but I'm here to tell you that all these invisible swamp dwellers who live and die\nBy such things as NAFTA are beside themselves that Trump got this done [noise] it is a huge middle finger to them\n\nNow to Bill Burton is just trade Limbaugh British show talking about trading not Kevin Kevin O's not inspiring anybody how can anybody listen this program and think that creating NAFTA took these people years Trump guts it\nKeep replaces it in ... and do an insult to injury that Mexicans and the Canadians want to be part of it they ask to be part of it\nAre noses we're not out of joint they're not crying and moaning about them also NAFTA they want in on this new Trump deal and that is also\nProfoundly insulting to the swamp dwellers they can't see straight this is just more hatred for Trump this is just it's blinding them\nAnd now there was a companion story didn't have a chance to get through it yesterday the child comes\nAre getting ready to lower their trade barriers on us exports because of Trump's tariffs it's all working\nThis is something nice guys never even tried to do to straighten out the trade imbalance\nThe ... the swamp well there's never even tried to do that that was just another circumstance we had to accept in the modern world and watch what's going to happen next I'll tell you right here and now Iran is going to come to the table you watch when that happens\nThis is all falling into place for Trump exactly as he said exactly as he is making happen\n\nI don't know how many of you do wire transfers but there is a form of wire transfer called swift and if you're goes ahead and puts on a replacement for swift Trump is liable to freeze uranium out of using it meaning it may have trouble moving money around\n[noise] [noise] that's why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal\nIn so many ways it's a huge deal and turning the swamp upside down on the inside out and it is a huge deal for\nTrump making America great again putting America First and following through on a deeply deeply committed in highly touted campaign promise trade deals were among Trump's top three campaign issues\nIt's not an accident that Ninety thousand people tried to get into the Trump in Johnson City Tennessee Johnson City Tennessee after the NAFTA deal is done ... ... ... ... that the people in Washington the drive by media are totally missing this it's not sexy told them it ... it's not a big deal NAFTA trade deal yeah\nScrewed Trump for doing it but they they don't have any ability to see its connection and its relevance and its importance in Trump's supporters remaining\nRamped up and loyal and then there's this\nOne more soundbite featuring your host CNN this happened and just before the conclusion of the previous hour I said ten minutes to one CNN aired this\nThere are some Republicans have have it all went down if he was defeated or he was forced to withdraw that that would just stand up Republican turnout because the quarter is there a holy grail and they would come rushing out his Rush Limbaugh saying don't bet on it\nIt's very easy to sit here to say in the midst of all the Democrat trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be so ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they never voted before\nBut his that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in because if that happens take that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate you think it's going to be easy\nFor the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin all were in the majority that we couldn't get a good ... you need to come out and mom for us\nHow does that work how does that work pretty good point I Do think that that's an important point that if Kavanaugh goes down and it'll be because moderate Republicans decided not to vote for him and that could depressed turn out in some ways that could lead to a number of people saying what's the point\nThe point I was making is and I I've been hearing this from a lot of people that have capital goes down it's just going to fire up troops because Republicans are saying and trying to make it happen and if if it goes on paper\nI ...\nI understand the thinking but it just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why do we have to\nIn order to win I never understood that\n\nWhy do we have to lose cabinet in order to gin up turning out I I ... and depending on how it would happen I'm not sure when Jenna turnout anyway you got the majority party\nSaying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and I go to the voters site where the majority and we tried we tried but we couldn't get anything from you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in\nIt and there's a disconnect there [noise]\nAnybody ever heard the name of Chris theme watcher

before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it in a sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live up this cartoon ladies and gentlemen was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right\nSpeaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was there some local talk shows but seeing as the only cable out and there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites start everything's starting to ... to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still ... four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the\nUh building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course uh I I was living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio [noise]\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio isn't the by the way it was more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine in a way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know there are the techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick that was his name grew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby that was actually a cover of\nTime magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine and the artist that his cartoonish interpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\n\nWell one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties at the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back some public and the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons not gone viral all over the Web but of course\nOn Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other little camp this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\nNow as I say if\nYou're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot camera and you don't have to

weapons are thinking on why that's been that long ago\nAnd you didn't have anything to oppose them they're just so\nYou imagine how they feel about this\nI mean they're fools to believe this was real in the first place but they're so damn desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon wife here it is number nine Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat\nWho on friday morning the morning and about held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that\nHe had figured out how to translate it and the date in quite he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he sought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capitalism so under\nMorning American or day George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they have been given free rein to interview whomever they want and that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult\nAnd if you believe Dr Ford\nJudge Kavanaugh\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them rub on allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's up to Capitol lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself and that means he's not quite on what they got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is now the throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nIs a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer yeah I think friday's mind yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear FBI's got a lot of shore or we can get\nThis done that's just to central\nMaybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target or they can catch Kevin in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise] the question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein\nYou don't just dozens of leaking this letter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners have been ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the leak but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and that she told us all about\nIt that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with
