this there's another part and things some Democrats do not think that this don't range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\nWell let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think\nThat conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so um to see if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this\nWhen you get into turn out for the November elections in

these are Senate races it's interesting in the CNN polling data the generic ballot I I'm just going to tell you don't get dispirited by this because it's it's a it's it's CNN\nBut on the generic ballot in a CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground but in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening now to plus Thirteen\nThat I I just I maybe it's my desire maybe it's my hope but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus at West the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of balance that it makes sense

operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of auto elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six wasn't election certainly to the exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially I and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are they answered a what ails America\nNot the dry buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen margin advantage but then you\nLook at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise] and then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh confirmation fight came to a conclusion\nWith independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\n\nEven though the Democrats on the surface would seem to have public opinion on their son ...\nSays the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved of further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independence disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compare to thirty percent who approved the\n\nAlso disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by and narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean in the past\nIt's been proven ... did it you know being ... [noise] I Can't prove anything all I have to go on a experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct I'd just\nDied on everybody believes this blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every\nStory of a drudge for example links links to on his page\nIs a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and\nThere are stories where Republicans supposedly thinking the same thing is going to happen certainly you you talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what ... ... well\nYeah I'd like to get an individual Paul's visual nine percent of the nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the into the new show I'm I'm just talking about over all the\nNational attitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you'll probably are too I'm only ... people that they get everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action now I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic\nParty cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not dumped me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly acted on concerned on interested in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous as they can be and they were the thing because\nThere's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies\nTo her book signing ceremony Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the albums but seriously I guarantee you that\nThey were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'll be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrump with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that\nWould make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try it they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump and draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons the daily wire has the story Washington\nPower couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced

or anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't

trying to prove this guy is a reprimand of the first order and you\nKnow officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or I don't see them\nAnd the cops we bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watched the said well that's it for the show\n\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places

during Democrat president Xi's\nDuring Republican president Xi's nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's

literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend it\nWhile telling him he needed to resign one of them was um [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget

memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John Powell basically try to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around and yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax that you didn't come forward then and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was a nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDrag now where did this nightclub and order brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically I tried to assault and the and the poor cab driver was desperate

some areas I half inch in Montgomery field but this is all about the change\nWhite women all white women or women went for me\nWhite women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against Democrat presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and the swerve into a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why this kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n[laughter] ... the left as as as started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds throughout the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to be calm Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christie on on on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the apps that judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws in reality today is because Democrats activism judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then\nPronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning legislation\nTo implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats wouldn't Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... P. S. not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere ...\nDid you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some ... ...\nBe able to eat to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Chris you're on on on poor listening to one another working out our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the rights of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face that's a Joe Biden ruled the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it but the Republicans\nDidn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana\nThat we're not supposed to ask the question to different things Russia camp extrapolate to voter registration drives an audience was for award show I can you people can make it up left and right I can draw a mild analogies I can ask these questions\n\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but the best stuff doesn't intimidate you I think I think it has an intimidated\nEvery Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have you or how you doing\nWell thank you longtime listener measures her first time caller thank you\nSo it's just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing with Muslim due to last night and I can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in love you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm big on civil to the likes of her\nShort would sure whether it be that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUh our world should be destroyed that is justice\nThat is what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nFinding backer resisting it we deserve what would\nYou know what I'm saying what about you [noise]\nNews radio six hungry go go live local\nThree thirty in the cocoa new center I'm Phil for our rains and clouds in our forecast for the rest of the day ends at midnight after that and we'll see though will see the cloud start to clear we had overnight rains but now I Want to read there was about to do an about face as Santa Ana winds move in\nAnd we have a a fire whether watch that goes into effect very early Monday morning and that's primarily because we're concerned about the win because we don't really expect the humidity's to draw up until later in the morning and in the early afternoon\nPhil Gonzalez with the national weather service and in Florida the search continues in Mexico bay and other parts of the panhandle after hurricane Michael ripped through that area reports of Seventeen dead the death toll expected to go higher\nEvangelical and North Carolina native pastor Andrew Brunson met with President Trump in the oval office today just hours after he arrived back in the U.
