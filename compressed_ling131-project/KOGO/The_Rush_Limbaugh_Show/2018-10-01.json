[noise]\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you were in limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened to what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school at Yale and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his

what is the sound bites them kind of be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ... this whole\nFBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in eleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least another week long handled this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things\nLater trap accusing Trump and the White House and trying to limit the FBI's go because you see there are things to find the Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years same FBI\nAnd it's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation so Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK\nThank you Mr ... two weeks ago two weeks so that White Houses now claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out\nHe's not limiting the scope and bases why course they're lying it was set up\n[noise]\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI has finished talking everybody these talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on\nIt will just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the same didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more\nTime to fix the fact that it was read they're going to do\nThat anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long and besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\nIn November because that's what this really is [noise]\nAnd Kavanaugh is caught in
