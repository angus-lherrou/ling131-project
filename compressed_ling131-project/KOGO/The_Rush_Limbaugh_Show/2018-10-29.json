say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe phone call conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump blame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump and frankly I'm worn out\nWith this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by ... ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten\nInflammatory\nJust said that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed into law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take up to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats and the left wing politicians from taking over the American health\nCare system meanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets its why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stopped in other words\nYou have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of eight presidents and it's so predictable because they hate the president will do anything they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this\nThis anger and if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link at the Trump\nWell I I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can't even get away from it from but Weber extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\n[noise] and then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and

Democrats wanted Brett Kavanaugh to sit back and take it you see the way this works is [noise]\nThirty six year old allegation can be banned for which there is no evidence for which for supposedly witnesses candy been placed themselves at the place because the victim doesn't know where it happened doesn't uh when it happened but it becomes real and we've got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kevin is supposed to sit back and just take it\nHe's just she those are the old rules in Washington people under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans have always acted well that's not that Donald Trump is he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're going to have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll acting and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything just to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works\nIn Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School or they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down to one\nThing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control markets are not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of\nShooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about\nSomething much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that you can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or ... but but but but but but we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned\nThis let's go to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base\nCase you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by the unified them all the cotton joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter\nSaid Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nSeem so a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill and the first\nQuestion a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is\nTrump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nAfter another got himself a bunch of checkbooks and then started writing bad checks for merchandise\nYou chew up a day later to return the same stuff asking for the returned

we can't\nHold them accountable way they have excuses you know we can look the other way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and

time I grew up a hard time I grew up with ... and maybe it's because I I mainly grew up in military and I got my dad was in the air force but there was never politics never came current event that but not politics\nLet me ask you this is like me ask you this up in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in your appearance opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they but they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but could could have said that they were I mean because when I\nSay that yeah because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways actually\nThey're willing they're willing to claim that victim had but nothing else [laughter]\nWell one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how\nA liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is the ... it it it's it's a Jewish state\nAnd yet there is there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's anti the religion and it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's it is it really isn't any type of religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from my religion I don't think you can and it you know any any time you're Jewish\nYou're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal in Israel now what is it always a disclaimer\nI'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel feeling that come to that and that it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics disassociated with with Israel is a ... because if their entire religion that's big I mean the the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches hung on many\nDifferent flavor [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I I feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist and many theaters they're anti Christian Quito um I don't\nEven necessarily being seeing Islam but I you know but I did the right guy\nThis that's exactly right and this is where this is all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are the trend is towards atheism and no God\nOr at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else it bears no\nUltimate power that can meet out\nApprove or disapprove of one's accidental one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so you have this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nAll the liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so ... disadvantage Pittsburgh did it did it\nAdds to any of the uh discomfort or on ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a ... million people out there targeting I'd choose in a way that they would Monica she'd have to bring it on I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country because of the country it\nSo that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he went and it certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I Know I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because they didn't Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think I Trump has anything to do it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they're predominant ... thank you thank you so much\nRachel I prefer just racial slurs Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with them in terms of a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after seeing sort of say a dare I say this\nYear I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by Senate Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the\nPeople I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an entirely different fits why I did the show open today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people\nIn fact I think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happens to these two events come along and they have it on this ... this has\nTo be what it is their thinking and they just can't help\nThemselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is washing the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished\nIs where the enemies of the laughter going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the left is concerned government as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing

they treat him\nYeah there may be\nBlamed to go around on both sides here but for the media just totally claim they've got nothing to do with this is absurd now here's Matthew Dowd this guy formally and George W. Bush Republican\nNow he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to read us a much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful Methodist\nOh yes he says oh Trump's false all of this is Trump's fault\nAnd the media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they they damn well one thing they influence opinion and shape the outcome of election day don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do the same time that seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called up\nOn this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss church who a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and\nMary Jordan of the Washington\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at in terms of murder\nI don't want to add\nTo the murder you know here's what I ... and yeah he is responsible for fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a living and it was a murder we didn't say that no we didn't see
