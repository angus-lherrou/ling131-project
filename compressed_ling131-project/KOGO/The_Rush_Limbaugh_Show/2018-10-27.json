have found today CNN is spending\nAlmost eighty percent of their time on this show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the caravan that tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America does and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on ... and of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen\nHip here and it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever know whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure\nThat was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think\nIt was radio six hundred cocoa breaking news\nTill for our Nicole do when you censor

to know that the FBI work around the clock to get them to answer as to why and how this happened\nThat said we ask for the public's patience in the coming hours and days as we work through this

mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never did push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and form you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting in one\nOf the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to\nThe young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best are being driven solely by a motion governs solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun and this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world\nCome on it because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes are seems to think that they do\nThe Democrat Party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\nOh and it can be any capsule or powder we call it takes a

get to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial sound bite me to make it look like I was trying to make the case of a shell game deserve to get killed\nBecause he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it\nOr in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned or is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but I don't know our constitution that Governor\nCan call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because of ...\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nYou he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do\nStand aside after seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms I joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand\nRussian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics I don't care if you're militarized is the border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring them back for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own he leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get off\nTo Russia and by be Mitt work\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well made take cigars for example the details are what matter a proper assembly properly rolling the cigar is central for a good draw the feel and the look on

their focus on creating the most reliable security for your family shows in the details simply safe centers are small they don't destroy the look at your home the system is easy to set up a news\nThey

[noise]\nWell we have some interesting calls when I hear a false and a couple up there a couple of callers who really\nWorried about this [noise] faster\nTrump's not going to be able to stop this and that the military\nIsn't train service and we have some people on the phones here think this could go south\nPretty fast and wreck and ruin everything will tackled this\nAnd much much more when we get back after an obscene profits time [noise]\nThey use peyote geo ham why San Diego live\nTwo o'clock in the ... center I'm Phil for are the death toll now eleven in Pittsburgh after a gunman opened fire at a synagogue happened this morning at the tree of life congregation\nTo Trump and his presidency and his campaigns and they are to limit their livid at their inability to influence use of what they do is tell themselves you're too stupid\nTo know what's good for you which is how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left in ... it's how Hillary Clinton deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton can says well\nYou know incivility is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past I'm kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to\nPromise to do this that and the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm\nFor the media they've had Republicans who are elected properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support it but able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it\nTo their Jim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside\nJust roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a week\nLonger and he can't stand it after\nAll his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump you'll keep falling for the lives and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show\nAt some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to any more\nBut what is troubling as to what behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes [noise]\nAnd he doesn't I think because it still works instill riles people up [noise]\nDivides us horribly\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected so\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind the Trump to see the reaction of people or what he says and that's\nWhat's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything and so Trump is ... is working is spend like magic on you and\nAnd and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are\nWhich takes me to want peace that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist\nAt detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from MySpace every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nIn for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased print says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says\nEmpty the left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of tearing not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared\nLess this is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left\nAs this or go Lerner says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the ... only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist either no right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his Boston is they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectual they hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all she doesn't have any ... except getting the job done\nHis goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself invents and uses\nI'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he\nIs certainty that America is decent then exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years the people that have had some serious problems\nWith me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so certain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people this is not right and everybody has their you you just don't wait too\nYou know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it fine no you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you wouldn't be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they love equip vacation they love people see the both sides of the things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certainty especially when it conflicts with their\nOwn now back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guidelines women\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for it sometimes\nHe's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left and right or ashamed of him as they are I'm JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the ... of on constrained average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look band other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents\nWorry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep\nOver it [noise] the difference between citizens who hey Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nWhether they love are merely tolerated even comes down to their views of the typical American the former factory hand the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\nWhat Trump investigated to aunt there just to be tied to heaven persuade you to join them\nSo now you're part of the problem\nAnd so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of

Ohio David Europe first today high\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir\nThis morning I was listening to NPR and Steve [laughter] I ate a reference to the mob but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the\nJohnson the stench of snow ban is making his eyes water so they use the mob they don't want to say mark they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people when it's good for them but when it's not good when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster that there's you know thousands of the other line went on he couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so ah your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR is a great did you want to listen to NPR you wonder what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can [noise] that the uniform\nWe've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I've interested in NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said a further audience and and that happens when I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks [laughter]\nAh but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar torn poverty and the violence in ...\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings they just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hard it is so bees are want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an assault me screwing Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of\nWhat's this guy's Jorge ... Ramos or whatever it is it is what does he tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell them no but what is it Univision right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and\nHe's bouncing for him he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want us a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I ask myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nAnd then they quoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting they come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered the germs\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye of the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats spoke asked about the timing worried them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that there spoke to over this even before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Coney end up Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrats\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border\nThreatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the caravan\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in a group to tour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense it later with that because this report is right this is helping Trump's uh why would the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so ... and\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotional say have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put yourselves\nIn their shoes every day they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times out Trump's toast they've\nRead it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been God's so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nVote them out of office remove them from a daily public a political circumstance where they can anger so many people\nAre just a public service and it is a\nA heartfelt attempt\nTo be compassionate and helpful [noise] time will go on and we've all we've all learn who it is targeting these innocent Democrats\nWe've all learn why these innocent Democrats were targeted and probably whoever did it will be apprehended and we will find out who they are where they are why they did it who pay them or if they were not paid but the simple fact remains\nDemocrats in America are at risk\nTo save for them to protect them vote against them\nA public service announcement from me or host Rush Limbaugh and the idea of [noise]\nNow the uh the bomb here as the moms it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise] so I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing a shaggy right\nSo Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill showing it come back here and they started sending out bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn aide to Hillary Clinton fully brains\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy ranges is [noise]\nI mean the elevator doesn't go to the top floor fight to say is an order of fries short of a Happy Meal\nWhy would someone smart enough to make a functioning mail bombs actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\nAnd ... and and so close to win the election what kind of food would do something like this\n\nIs a smart bomb maker [laughter]\nIf somebody really really good at making bombs hates the left\nThis much does he think\nThis is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think and all candor that what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn mad I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative\nAnd you've watched everything blow up on your your watch Kevin I'll blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you\nAnd it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what couldn't you'll be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense\nTo show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans to other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt is brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that backfired\nAnd ball leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of the worst that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it okay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday [noise]\nI'm Bevan who cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what\nWhat real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today he said that\nIf there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here\nAnd Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they had a real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing he says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles\nHand to hand combat is how we described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project I pick up a twenty five states twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nAll her on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple to Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sent an email that I received\nA lawsuit but I've been able to have it there was just this morning\nAnd I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them\nBut I just want to share with some of the things I get some of the is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me a into promoting whatever it is that I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passionately this guy\nWho is it a story and who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone\nJust not as well known as he looks at things he's he is an absolute\nRed wave and he did not believe this until last night\nHe's been seeing trends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to\nConvert any of these trends are the actual prediction until now he says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is craze wearing the whole Democratic Party now Amy ... is in a seven point race she was not too long ago in a in a\nDemocrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months drive by is ushering everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it\nYeah it's got to beat curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys mislaid changes story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about Bloomberg says but it did in ... they could go either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go and ... what what is this decision all of a sudden\nVersus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nSo they still have their reputations all of a sudden it could be really really\nClose much closer than we ever ever knew gets a cycle and you can print\nNews radio six hungry go go live local\nAnd the ... for our eleven people dead\nAfter police say a deadly shooting took place at a synagogue in Pittsburgh once again eleven dead more than ... injured after a gunman opened fire during service at the tree of life congregation happened this morning and it's very horrific crime so\nAuthorities say that suspect forty six year old Robert de Bowers\nSocial media activity shows Mr Bowers shows the history of anti Semitism filled with slurs in references to anti Jewish conspiracy theories\nHundreds of Mexican federal officers carrying plastic shield blocking a Central American caravan from advancing towards the United states today after a group of several thousand migrants turn down the chance to apply for refugee status\nAnd obtain Mexican offer for benefits there\nPresident Trump in Indiana speaking at an agricultural convention he also did talk about the shooting in Pittsburgh and across the country security tightened the Jewish community centers and synagogues on this ship bought the last day of the Jewish work with the week\nYou can dispose of unwanted on this ... prescription drugs today it's part of the take back national drug day and maybe a Notre Dame at S. D. C.

Brendan ... trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part to overeat budding emerge\nMounting a murderer is now on the ... radio I just open the Fox\nNews radio six hundred cocoa [noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's weaken reviews are quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaign name [noise]\nTwo thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] schools we have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nSo no I mean how how many are are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterms the Clinton now is Obama an obstacle and they know I mean what are the Clinton and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour third team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people to come in and spend\nSome time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about\nPolitics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale at every event here yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on everybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft troubling as phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with somebody leftists tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred and so much anger why not say that this is just to back it it's just [noise]\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what in form ... and a educated suspicion about this one tells you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time on\nThe phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Raasch then within that there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very much\nFor us you know it's you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these\nBombs in the mail [noise] you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be owned by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information it's just not out there for the masses to obtain you know there was never any country these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrat they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't stoop to everything from they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's well it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be\nInstant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWhat does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and a lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today\nAnd the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab Lee a tweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then lose", "year": "2018", "show_name":
