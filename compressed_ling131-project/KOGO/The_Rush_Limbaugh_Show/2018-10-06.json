to meet people and had a festive a good time and a and all\nThat oh everybody was raven ... American flags and uh I haven't bought or trumped up forever but\nLet me did you did you see any a depression sadness a defeat is him over the fact that the Democrats are going to win everything in November\nI Know so there was none of that there was no roller coasters and I'm I'm Tania everybody had a great time\nIn fact um there was a gentleman who started walking back down to ... and he told me that it was far away from them and are you still had a smile on his face so\nAnd that's great [noise] well it sounds like\nThe news reports this we had our uh our accurate and of course this this it just doesn't jibe with with any of the news we keep hearing about Republicans being depressed or on the e gr waning and who is he has them and all of that\nAnd it's just it just is kind of thing all during the two thousand sixteen campaign remember all of the experts said this does not matter you can't judge the way and election is going to go by campaign rallies\nSo they they don't mean anything I mean every candidate is going to have a rabbit and followers it'll show up at her doesn't mean anything well Hillary didn't she couldn't fill a symbol\nCannot require or demand investigations into women\nYou imagine if somebody tried that I mean women as an entire gender population of the country men are under investigation and this country being through cabinet or through Trump or whoever\n[noise] now that's got the Trump mock Amy this is the hill dot com mocking Christine ... let me look at the audio soundbites here um what's your grabs soundbite number five\nAnd six this was what the left is a is really irritated about today last night in South haven ... suburban Memphis it just barely over the Tennessee Mississippi State line and here is Trump there's another make America Again rally\nMake I wanted to get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where I don't remember how many years I don't want to but I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know [laughter] I don't know what I mean that's the only thing I remember [noise]\nMan my visiting Saturn a man's life is shattered\nNow that is not marketing for word mocking would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her\nTo be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they\nThey they they played ride along and without ... Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was\nUm all Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this country an accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristine ball the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying but this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything\nAnd he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat\nGives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and I have taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there had been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about like ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at the moon to the right\nTo own and he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans having Trump has Trump has a ... that after\nIt makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you\nHow it irritates them see he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has ... continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how ... insane it has made them with rage other Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand and three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\n\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski in Collins or shuttering and cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said it's true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply boy she came back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why you're not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accused any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me two were all women can joined that can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine if men organized for the express\nPurpose\nOf destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRoche ... million women or nor do there should we do\nWell yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not\nAbout even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female range\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and I've been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats are Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nTrump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party isn't so and that's what Democrats senators have said\nLet's go to the phones I've got the suburban women story I'll save it for just a second I gotta get to the phones an hour and a half I'm Sorry folks ah this is Brian St Augustine in Florida really really really appreciate your waiting thank you\nThank throw a corner to save at our capital are gonna go for all the women who have really your fault but were afraid or embarrassed to report it\nUh well I knew you may have a ... I I I think you're right or wrong you're right in line with one of my new found theories\nAnd it's actually not a new found theory what it is is a very late arrival on my part of being able to verbalize\nYou've you've heard over the years liberalism mental diseases are all kinds of ... and I thought that that that's too simplistic and besides it's not effective I mean even if it's true it's not going to be effective say that\nBut that doesn't erase the fact that we're dealing with some genuine\nIn comprehensible emotional problems on the part of these people and I have to give credit where credit's due it was a little blurb by Jim guarantee at National Review that caused the explosion\nOf brain ... in the frontal lobe beer\nHe said\nI'm paraphrasing I don't have a right in front of me but you said I don't even think this is what is I think psychological disorders people but psychological disorders have become liberals in politics that that that that that psychological disorders\nPeople who have them have brought their disorders into politics and rather than just a singular thing had happened to them they make it all about the country did it to them or an entire population did it to them\nAnd I think that's exactly what liberalism and has become and that's where we agree\nNews radio six hundred go go live local\nIn cocoa new center I'm Phil for our a

Diego's moaning the weekdays five and I\nWas radio six hundred cocoa\n[noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review readings and walking back Rush Limbaugh the ivy network for here is the is the James with them to the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them\nUnder the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or The Revenge is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this um [noise] it it well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes\nBecause the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has\nConstructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is American\nAs she founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in\nFor men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination it racism all of this [noise]\nThe Democrat Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never that range and the anger never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply resign did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had Woolsey forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary", "show_name": "The Rush
