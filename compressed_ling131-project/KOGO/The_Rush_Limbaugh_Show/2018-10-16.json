hasn't been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of\nVoting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world\nUsing common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave the trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections\nLeft and right
