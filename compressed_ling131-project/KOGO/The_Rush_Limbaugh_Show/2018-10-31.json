you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many

can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blob vi\nAnd become flat line and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much and at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever\nPitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump print to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's totally constitution no it isn't there you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting in the country's again Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all of this Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump\nDoes made it it is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded there's no complicated mistreated this is just what it is that's who the opponents are\nVery hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come back to the life remember had told yesterday I made a leftist were convinced that Mahler\nBy now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of indication and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up to election there's a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump first day they heard at the Trump stole the election they have believed Mahler has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it and it's holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time\nDespite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Mueller\nAnd his people trying to remain relevant rising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about\nThat how many\nMonths maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking showed lawyers making sure that Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen from never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story\nThat both sides were participating in the news now is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump end when the house and Senate has fizzled it's not there so they're turning they always do\nTo other things we also have the usual parade of celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that where you really are not motivated to do anything celebrities in vi is\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist we now have\nIt was the protesters outside wherever the president goes you're hearing about forty four thousand people who signed some petition saying we don't want you here\nMr President\nWe don't want you we don't want your wife we don't want your Jewish pretend daughter we don't want your joints son in law we don't want any of you

getting in the countries that can Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as Olivia is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rally the base that's where you're wrong Trump\nDoes made it it is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing we have a crisis burrowing\nIn terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded the snow complicated mystery to this is just\nWhat it is that's who the opponents are hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went and now the Mueller investigation looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come back to life\nRemember had told yesterday I made a leftist were convinced that Muller by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of indication and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up to election is a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it\nAnd it's holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time\nDespite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen in between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope\nMuller and he was people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that\nHow many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking showed lawyers making sure the Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen from never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides were participating in\nNews now is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThat take away is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled it's not there so they're turning they always do\nTo other things we also have the usual parade of celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advise\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah were told they offer is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democrat governor for Georgia Stacey what is your name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah\n... was treated the wounded and it gets very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\n[noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you got us the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in this story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a saw out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what pulling you look at I don't care what professional here talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows bottom line\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good world do you know why I think it was was it two thousand and fourteen thousand twelve\nWas one of those two elections were Nate Silver look into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat won the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he's in the tunnel\nSince that won election where he was an infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver to stay sane when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want to go\nHeard pat ... can I say the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll only does this analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poll even at the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nTo the guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\n\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blob vi and become flat line\nAnd it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much and at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever\nPitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump print to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about

all in favor of his many people getting in the country's again Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist

... what is your reaction to this I mean there are the folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's down on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the American left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration that a real objective has been to transform America away\nFrom the traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary and evidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still

there was there was sucking hot or they were in the last place out there\nAnd ah this was that was pre Trump and the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of

indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became\nA standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything or do a success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for

nevertheless Boynton racist\nComment not reported on not highlighted but we will [noise]\nHe's halo geo ham why I have to go live local\n[noise] get the impression that all of that inertia and energy is lost but I think people in the news business and consumers of those are two different things and I really believe that people in the news business in all businesses are among the most detached from their customers consumers\nThat any other business out there any other retail business I think the news business\nHas people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know the business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does\nDon't know if one I don't know of a business\nWho ... who reject half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit negative is is assuming and an operating on the assumption that whatever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks or everybody cares about so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf the momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline that wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like in Fort Myers\nYeah certainly there are thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies planned between now\nAnd election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election and he's pumping a ...\nThere is of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence consumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all of the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media is not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking\nA lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb in the synagogue shooting\nThis was you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on election day and I don't believe in the videos does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd you only have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe in the ... not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close to me that we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Portland should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even\nGetting that message out I don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus if it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade\nOn this that's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these ah incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why\nIs that why is it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is\nThe design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats questioning Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the Ford with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present as any but the media and the Democratic\nParty were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets to convert gets ... get the confirmation vote\nAnd isn't sworn in why did the media drop it if Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all that just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway\nIf the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political\nNone for which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there's a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made humbling guys to terrify here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYou Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking\nA Democrat opponents they still oppose Kavanaugh don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot to wait to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost and their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one is that cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be

unusual during her from my heart rate [noise] I'd check it now and it's when you want to watch\nAn apple you can't help but tracking it's constantly checked for you and sometimes my heartbeat racist over a hundred and twenty beats a minute during this program\nThat's more than when I exercise\nCourse exercise for me as a relevant thing uh back to the phones we go to Minnetonka, Minnesota this is a Ella and it's great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much for taking my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because ... was becoming more than I can handle I started writing my own class has caused courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration as a general the book probably gets about one paragraph what most people don't understand is one needs millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way that Democrats want to do now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nEspecially looking after I used to take a device him like open up\nThe upper I live and if you had a disease called truck karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when did\nNow wants to ship doctor perform has examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the CIA coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quite not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong\nYou realize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nThat's what people are thinking listening to tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who could work\nUm there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one paved streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me to listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we were on the whole global everybody not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about the kind of history he's gonna be learning it so I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books to oh wow you know\nVery was because I think that where's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history books all revised they give even a paragraph maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph Abraham Lincoln John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the night is that a survey\nAnd the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference they ram like one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example in American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard\nZinn as a textbook writer as a as a as a isn't quite as I socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this good but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the\nProgram so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process now we were a much newer and younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth\nAnd it was Rick wired that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they'd be helping we we're not going to open the borders to\nIllness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nHad to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nGot the loudest and most sustained applause of any announcement are you ready when apple announced that the new Matt book air is made of one hundred percent recycled\nAluminum the young people in that in that room\nErupted into a ... game standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's all over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that their main\nUh be away for life\nTo be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who've been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer year and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes\nNow that it's going to the audio soundbites vis vis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history president was greeted by a hundred protesters singing this land\nIs your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not so ... what what does\nImmigration refugees have to do with this have been in any way why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper the protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump just hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come in every did gum they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump's first lady\nYou Monica Trump Jared course they're walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shooting\nThat road\nRage drinker and go to\nThat you can't keep having chances\nYou will not see this on any network those cast you will not see that video on any news channel anywhere\nThank you thank you President Trump that you were ... thank you we love you thank you for coming thank you very much no thank you sir you're the best the best great job thank you Mr President we love you thank you can I shake their hands thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jake Tapper so the protests are not surprising nobody wanted to president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your sham should my thought this was not to replace you know business going they don't want you to forty thousand people signed a petition asking\nTo come away we're not true we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center\nAnd now I'm a lawyer you're the first lady and if Monica Trump get some love to\nThank you very rainy [laughter]\nThank you very much her name is Jim you've paid me ... [laughter]\nThat was a male employee looking at Jerry cushion are saying nobody ever heard of you laughing at his wife was a bigger star that's fine no problem everybody laughing about it but what is you're not going to see it as anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program that this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers waving a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants Donald Trump anywhere she everybody hates Trump everybody despises Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait\nTo vote for Democrats Trump can't do anything you know everybody wants the Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that's your drive by maybe\n\nThey don't show you get a reaction to real people you will not see those videos you not hear that audio and\nReduce the number one of your personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh be\nListening to Rush Limbaugh\nRadio\nGo [laughter]\nEveryone you know let's stop what we're doing right now\nAnd ...\nJust like that we had a nice special sort of moment together [noise]\nOf course they don't all need to be quiet moments to be special that they can be loud moments goofy moments sporty moments\nDorky moments moments where we talk for a\nBecause every time dad like us take a moment like that\nTo spend with our kids\nSounds like somebody agrees\nSo let's take a moment to make a moment\nTo de ... eight seven seven four dead for one more and more visit fatherhood dad got\nBrought to you by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the ac [noise]\nDownload the free I hard radio ... today [noise]\nWell CNN was the first to do it a month ago CNN declared the Democrats have won the house because of one of their falls in the poll lousy\nIs declaring victory in the battle of the house she was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night and set up until today I wouldn't have said is the election were held today we were when but what I'm saying now is we will when we when we will win the house\nNancy Pelosi\nPredicting a house that was already been won by to divert so no need the Democrats for zero\n[laughter] they use peyote geo ham why I have to\nGo live local\nNews time eleven o'clock on live on a Harvey firefighters are trying to put out a fiery crash involving it overturned pickup truck it's blocking all lanes of south at eight oh five\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but\nIn mid term elections I can I can show your count was ... in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nNobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because I'm so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody\nHated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the electorate in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're\nExamples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from uh most of the real clear politics by one of the written down the poll\nAnalysts and data analyst there is Sean ... I'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out to four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as mid terms\nFinal stretch nominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as many germs that her final stretch\nTo twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and Fifteen majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democratic majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother\nAny sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not Mr trend days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president is job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race than there are likely a lot so\nTrump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIsn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things [noise]\nAnd then the next paragraph how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been in the massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines\nOr California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this would be enough to flip the majority but it's never craft run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into way closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how reliable aren't on this thing [laughter]\nAnd then the next ... are we relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next ... what is it\nEarly voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise]\nSo the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before 'cause the stuff that's going to determine the way I hadn't even happens so we're going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate goal competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh film [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of prices regardless of whether that happens\nWe're well set up for such an eventuality bottom line I happen to the slightest idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize as one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up with as much intelligence analysis you can muster\nReal milk butter cheese

is a man and get those are the kinds of things that people are up against and you know there's a journalist David ... who ah who writes and [noise]\nOf quotas work here a bunch of time and he's out saying something that I have mentioned on this program countless times that of course the Democrat Party is the drive by media and vice versa drive by media is the\nDemocratic Party they are they in fact I I think the drive by media is actually the organizing power a behind the Democrat Party and Mr ... saying this but he's he's saying that in his opinion a growing number of the American people are aware of it now\nThe federalist that's right that's right he was a Mollie Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are succinctly aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and it'd be a way beyond by us if if that's true for a number of these things are true then they're convert will be a major surprise and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on
