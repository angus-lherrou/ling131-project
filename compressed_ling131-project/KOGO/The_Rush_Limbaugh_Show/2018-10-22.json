time on the show the\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on the show again they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms with the same point in his presidency after two years there just resigned themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't\nI don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure\nThat was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting it was not born of any evidence there couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think it puts sort of things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening not\nSeven thousand a day but but but every day this is one that has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military now and they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families at the border and how Trump doesn't like the narrative and didn't wanna glass so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got to show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that what do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right word but they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras\nTo the southern border of the United states assistance and Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\n\nNews radio six hungry go go live local\nDNA leads to a murderer rest on the Joshua Lipton

group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way the\nThe details on that story are from the ah\nHere's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what Tom pales saying sectarian saint palm pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes to\nPoint out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind wouldn't want this who in their right\nMind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote their son wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what takes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and form you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intended across the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this [noise] I think it's a classic illustration of how tough discovery is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest for being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and say to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get into the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with\nThe people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt

who would exploit them were also concerned\nThat this punt pale saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say what you can use the military because of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do\nWith using the military just stopping invasion from another country so\nThere is nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what Woodrow Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you know you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics I don't care if you're a militarized is the border they if they bomb rushed the border like it is down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a a house and Senate back in the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean you you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and he started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is it a whole lot of different ways will

whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get in that is not the kind of thing that happens with in a political party that is losing\nLosing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies\nYou know I don't know posters that Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in a in the Phoenix area\nAnd if the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going through it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be and they sent me a video that they took what their iPhone tennis max driving along the entire line in order to make the video fit\nTo be in a size they could email to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis is that this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get and how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national\nMedia CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing us because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democrats' side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of ...\nThese kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\nThe turtle and his wife are at a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky and some mad cap asinine\nProtesters shows up and just start shouting things a turtle just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in a restaurant or just watching all this go by this guy is making a spectacle and I watched them talk about this on Fox today\nAnd they were talking about such a [noise] a weight loss of loyalty and she'll board and this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\n\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side whatever you want to call a lack of civility indecent see whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes\nPositive outlook these are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people to Nick might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can\nThat's a number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\nSo you think the Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have marched jumped through Mexico mad look out committed they are those people are really and we're supposed to sympathize with if they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\nHealthier brain better life\nNow available in stores everywhere things up and evaluate anybody at the product is not intended to ... prevent any disease where every news happens\nStay connected to stay informed news radio six hundred cocoa [noise]\nOkay\nBack to the phones we go to a voting in Macon\nGeorgia great to have you with us on ER network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well it's great to have you here\nLike the reason why I called I spend a lot of years the military are retired from the brain and although we are very good a lot of things we're not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we've not good at so this situation and look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this is not a military invasion and talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving or steep poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it play\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and yeah the harm on them is that what you're saying\nI mean I think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're into your sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nTo okay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross\nOkay what happens then if they do and are\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your ... your ears bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use you use some kind of force but not lethal\nYou only have ... thanks to you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal and like a pig and then it's you know we we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\n[noise] but the presidents would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is\nJust put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a ...\nWell this proposition no I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they are not used to it I don't know how to do it\nBut I still got all these I think we should but we have to be prepared politically and militarily well then what is it what's the preparation for you to have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay and I'm just doing this in the interest of time on my bed may it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome doing not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to want to tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line probably what Bush or talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but\nWe'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got to hit that it was storm caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they're mad when people strike or we just have to\n... even if there is a casually or to the drive by half their story Trump cherry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd they're still peril yeah okay so the alternative is still a lot of men no no I have to hold\nA lot it and like I say somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to eat one for the team to legalize let's see it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is um I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it got to take a break\nThis kind of thing does not happen\n\nTo political parties losing favor it does not happen to the candidates losing favor and about to be overrun by a Democrat blue wave and just to remind you of\nTom ... is on CNN Today the chairman of DNC no no no no we we always knew this election was going to be close [noise] we all we asked you if you know the right places to look the drive by and the Democrats are really walking this back\nNow I Know a lot of your ... rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost ... but they haven't this is just I don't believe that smokes these people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up after Trump won but there's a companion story ... all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out\nTo try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidates and it isn't working now by showed up to do a rallying for the Democratic candidate for\nGovernor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated runs a census last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the wind and Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective\nThat's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective he ... he would be a disaster for Florida right now to elect anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you live in Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters and you and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrat leftist who doesn't want to be in the private sector success because the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything for his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has wanted an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible news of being Zach worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor or in in Florida\nRick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and here Rick Scott is one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just\nCame through with flying colors and and and no one has become a just a static flat line just a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit the Florida or not\nBut the Santas would be great defense is is a is a re get night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nIn it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have ah\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every\nAchievement that has been made in the past ... if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really was undeserved\nWe wave stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I\nCan't I Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like Trump\nTweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt\nAt transforming America into being something\nThat it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to beat and you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nArgue better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or less have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way\nI mean this is just hands down at his Andrew Gillum personify is personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ...
