ranks at another one down in all parts is ...\nNobody's trying to stop it and it's up to four thousand people now it's estimated that this is costing somebody Twenty one million dollars\nThese people have to be fed the they have to be transported and they have to use the bathroom they have to be\nAble to drink water and whatever else they can get their hands somebody is making this happen somebody thinks that this is going to watch or gr well for Democrats were told that\nGeorge Soros money is a is behind this I don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money to make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of the camera pan\nIs the children as it always is there are children\nIn the caravan and that it's kind of like the baby on board science I always hated those I even had one made a baby not on board but we're still as valuable as anybody else's inside this guys we had\nOne of those made that knows bother you baby on board rush maybe on\n... exactly when a rush maybe on board little inside that it'll a yellow sign we made it up and it was available at the Rush Limbaugh store\nBut this is the same thing children young\nChildren also we must do what we must open the gates we must stamp decided we must allow them passage\nSo he's got this we have the\nMueller report as I say more on that in a moment the ... report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio soundbite I have coming up uh uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd this former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nWho who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what helped Democrats\n\nThat it's not just Trump separating the Trump not letting the man\nI go there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion image growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just thick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them an entry or\nTo separate the children from the adult so that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already\nWritten ... that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan already in the can where these people will say they're shocked they came to America to save their lives were their children to improve their latest days won't let the man this is like anything they ever heard about the cuts of pictures of Trump\nSmiling as people are denied them three Democrats think\nThis\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically this it'd be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way or am I missing something somehow a massive group of four thousand people it's growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt just making bad we obvious what it is is there a lot of people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be playing poverty but\nThat happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just read it it's planned this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making of the United states look bad that\n\nI'm not I'm not sure that that that that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the Mueller report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and this is something we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of tropical to go to Russia so if mothers ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the justices really fine lease soundbite here [noise]\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and I look at this [noise] get won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is number ... audio soundbite number tens and this is\nThis is deep state ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\nHe's a counterterrorism center specials what he is and blisters said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report and narrative if you will from Mahler going over Rosen high let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there's going to be some dirt in there so in addition to the indictments I really want us to be within that narrative report\nOkay so this is wondering is this going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff Trump is none none of which is\nProbably going to be an sizable none of which is going to be impeachable although if the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt dirt not the indictments\nWhich\nThere is nothing less they make it up there never has\nBeen any Trump collusion and there never has been the evidence or less they make it up [noise]\nSo the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being sold in over his head that it looked like the Russians have worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence\nIt's hard to refute the idea of going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence that's what\nIt's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWhose work we have referenced many times on this program she has written a book chronicling lay deception\nTalking about the Democrats [noise]\nNews radio six hundred go go live local\nHail brief the president Tom Joshua Lipton in the cocoa new center the secretary of state says Saudi Arabian

what happened to the missing journalist he says the Saudi investigation will hopefully reveal the truth but noted that Saudi Arabia is an important us ally\nBut I think it's important for us all to

the\nSituation involving a death of the so called Washington Post journalist Jamal ...\nWho's now being referred to as a lovable little teddy bear\nType guy in the New York times\nThere is but I Know I went through this the other day but I Am continuing to see this is what makes me suspicious of this story folks\nYou know I read my tech blog ...\nI read everything there\nAre still people attempting\nVia they're reporting to suggest that there was a recording of the murder of ... from his apple watch\nMy friend's ... this\nIs item number one that aroused my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this in certain do Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any relation any any complicity MS story\nSo whoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by the show these apple watch now somewhere on iCloud\nA ... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name has been misappropriated and has been falsely accused\nOf reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNow very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work I Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is el he or cellular signals two years ago when apple in well actually a fourteen month when apple introduced the series three watch they\nActivated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you can do anything you can take it away from the fault inhabit operate it would still get emails and messages and they're recording your workout data and so forth if you could receive a ... like they didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that they they watch\nIt failed to be here don't just ceased to be a slave to the phone the other two ways or blow to and why fight those are the three ways that data can get to watch him David can leave a watch\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watched they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in the car in the parking lot at the consulate there's only one way that watch couldn't communicate with that phone\nWhile there's two ways there'd be why and blow to blow to if you have to blow to it this week by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against other nations being able to monitor adding to over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just like there's ... ... ... that couldn't happen so you don't have the way it would be why\nBut that would only work if\nThe wife find network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\nAnd the wife I connection on watch just because the phone connects to why when the phone does the watch automatically connection but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because the phone it's parents who uses it then like if you're at home\nYou're ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you will connect to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think Shelby did that like he was probably know to do it um\nI don't know that they would give him the password how many got the password of the Saudi Saudi consulate wife signed up the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to the show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud is just so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this\nFive and work in a way of toward story

this morning outside the White House soundbite number one he was speaking to reporters about the meeting that they'd had a with Trump to brief him\nI told President Trump this morning that\nWe ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do have some understanding of the facts surrounding that which we can make decisions about how\nThe United states should respond\nSurrounding Mr joking\nWhen I probably would have been met with President aired on the talk to me about the incident he told me that they were conducting their own investigation so we do believe that between these two efforts a complete picture will emerge for what actually transpired here\nYeah so while everybody else has gone the conclusion everybody else the Saudis dismembered him fifty and hit men

didn't I keep that train of thought going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something of a digital camera I got an email here um this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs that ...\nWe had a call here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw Trump the yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well back camp that camp that says it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that fright also includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's why yard signs of not being put out I I was part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of\nYard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches of Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way so\nI have a video taken by it Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that what a puppet pop up here just second this picture you're going to see us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose and there was this guy a\nDemonic looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then are ripping it to shreds\nAnd at one point he stormed the Cruz supporter who was a video showing him on his camera and got this demonic threatening look on his face\nStart shouting till the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises crows [noise]\n[noise] and I've taken a still shut up put it up there this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping up out of yards\nAnd this still shot here storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera he actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't still shocked that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nA there is nothing [laughter] there's nothing about the stark raving mad\nAspects of today's Democratic Party that is an illusion it is all\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why even the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not an illusion so they want you to know they want\nReaders to do this left turn is by golly by gosh for real\nThe sub bad like many overnight sensations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties and the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past eight years begins and Mr Thomas Bee and soul the Democrat electorate has most steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates\nSelf identified liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party raising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank and come on\nCome on up the Democrat Party elite sad to say we're never these radical leftists now I'm\nGoing back ... Clinton the Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one or two thousand eight team to share a Democrat voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderates has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next graph assist them money\nGraph ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this simply leftward according to Gallup their share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent and because of this growth white liberals are now roughly ... percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrats minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not been growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute\nInto those are the level of white working class was totally go to hell\nNow all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high\nFor Republican candidates while\nA substantial percentage Democrat minorities identify as liberals those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rage that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of the black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination as a factor holding back\nAfrican American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\nPlacing a much stronger emphasis then\nAfrican Americans now wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party Owens white suburban women right we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrat liberalism\nWho are back back in ...\nShrimp boat show me I miss work\nMore rush just ahead on news radio [laughter]\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American lives destroyed by our broken immigration\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin\nThere is no place for that kind of language you shouldn't have said that since Speaker Paul Ryan who is usually measured in his criticism of the president\nRepublican history teacher is Liz mayors have yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern\nWhen you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it and in fact [noise] right on cue\nI have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written it was just thirdly there's the name of Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you\n[noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I mean he was the premier journalist you not was not an executive but he practically ran the place\n[noise]\nI met him at Mr Buckley is home here in ... ... you were good birds but Lance Morrow\nWas a a typical criminalist which means means weapons so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump the always concern is that Trump's outrageousness no longer fuels anger on the left as it should gives people it just got used to it\nEnded up the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing the Democrats have to get their people to the polls\n\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel report well maybe the headline is true the Republican fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case of a suburban woman\n[noise] thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut this election\nIs really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nIt I just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet ... this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes\nHere it may it may have caused other Republican candidates to it'll lose maybe holy elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they\nAssume this is it that Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video then it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the sale dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\n\nPresident Trump today warn that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop the also this is the caravan that's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador are saying that they have almost no control over their population\nI'm watching the Democratic party land because they want to open borders and existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S [noise]\nThese people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help the Democrats get votes\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand ill legal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the mid term elections as we discuss somebody's\nPaying for this that somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using\nFacilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used\nHere I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who\nThinks that this caravan arriving within a week say of the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop so what's the calculation\nHere well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation and may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's got to be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incident of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start in by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats things that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of Trump that Trump weren't there none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting sir you're up next\nThe afternoon rush hey

of them\n\nThat in a nutshell Mr Limbaugh is the voter who was driving the entire Democratic Party\nOff the cliff [noise]\nThat from a woman\nIn the audience who sent me\n[noise] take a brief time out
