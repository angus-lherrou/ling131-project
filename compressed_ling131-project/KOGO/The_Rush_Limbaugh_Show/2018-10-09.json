nation\nApologizing to Kevin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd the ... episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas the left is not\nInterested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us and they have no desire for the ongoing political arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they\nHave no limits on how low they will go on how the Braves and perverted they will be in seeking their reality in all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean to go back to the twenties and Soviet influence from communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention or whether it's because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nI Am so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't do it so the the closer to the president you can trace the beginnings of current problems the

legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledgment\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our

evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he is not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with\nThis and that's what

the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by age twenty eight point margin\nIn the sea and the and poll that's not how it was supposed to be that's not what people were supposed to conclude people were supposed to conclude that\nKavanaugh is unfit capital has no business being a judge anywhere much less the Supreme Court that cabin on needs to be destroyed justifiably so that's what people were supposed to realize that that's what mid term voters are supposed to agree to punish anybody who would try to voiced\nUs this week about miscreants like capital on the country but it

taking my call [noise]\nI watch uh the president Nikki Haley this morning I think Nikki Haley it tells the president a few months ago of her plan I think today will deliver it on the hill Cavanaugh I think he's got somebody in mind\nIs going to announce that person before the election and what are the drive by the Democrats going to do\nThey're going to start fighting oh we can have this person well this is terrible and then what's going to let the election people are going to say it's not going to stop we can't allow the Democrats back in it\nIsn't going to stop whether the Democrats win or lose this\nIs the point you're right but it isn't ever going to stop until these people are so soundly defeated and become\nSuch a a very small group of people even then they're not going to stop it but cannot things not the end of anything they cannot thing for for as far as most people are concerned the\nWay you need to look this is the beginning this just the beginning of the white it's gonna be for as long as we allow it to be done to us\nAt ...\nAnd and you're right they're gonna try to poke holes and whoever Trump's nominee for UN ambassador is I haven't heard any names I haven't paid close enough attention and those are the names being bandied about might be\nBut they're going to do it on principle they're gonna do it because they think it will be a political advantage headed in the mid term showing once again the the world the country doesn't think Trump is justified and qualified to be naming anybody that this was or should he doesn't he doesn't deserve to be president we need to get rid of it and it's an old\nFoundation for which they are going to be have a anyway the question is does this hurts them or help them and not with their base I mean we know their bases ah

fourteen point lead in Tennessee in Nevada Dean Heller has a three point lead over his Democratic opponent rows and now these are Senate races is interesting in the CNN polling data\nThe generic ballot I I'm just going to tell you don't get dispirited by this because it's it's a it's it's CNN\nBut on the generic ballot in a CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground but in their generic poll the Democrat advantages widening now to plus Thirteen that I I just I maybe it's my desire\nMaybe it's my hope but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus at West the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of balance that it makes sense that way\nI just I I find it really hard to believe that after the last\nTwo to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent wants to Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\nI Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThat the first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the ... this is standard operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of all the elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six was that election certainly to the exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially I and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are they answer to what ails America\nNow the dry buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen margin advantage but then you\nLook at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\n\nEven though the Democrats on the surface what it seemed to have public opinion on their side\nSays the Washington Examiner\nJust thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved of further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independence disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compare to thirty percent who approved\n\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by a narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent\n[noise] so what does that mean independents disapproving everybody did it you know being ... [noise] I\nCan't prove anything all I have to go on um experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct\nI just I don't I everybody believed this blue wipe it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links\nLinks to on his page is a story of\nThe Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\n\nWhere Republicans supposedly think the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin coast in the house of representatives\nWell [noise] [noise] what I Know what what what what [noise]\n[noise] [noise] well yeah I'd like to get an unusual polls show nine percent of the nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the into the ... I'm just talking about over all national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm One of these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries if everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do\nIt looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us and I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary one again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be in until somebody in the Democratic party tried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly acted on concerned on an interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just a rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nUh and safety because I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like everybody is preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expand it or hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in\nNumbers we haven't seen and who knows how long since\nNineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and polling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right Rasmussen was one about away Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump's forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the dry ... trust shows them jobs even now after the Capitol hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven\nPoints back the Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it all but the Republican governor California is is closer than who's running as Gavin Newsom\nThan anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think Washington may be on the inhabitable for a while I I think we haven't seen the meltdown that is going to happen among many\nElected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are so so certain they're going to\nWin this they've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital and Trump and the effect doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all [noise]\nAnd very quickly [noise]\nNews radio six hungry go go live local\nNews time ten thirty I Lived on a Harvey and the twenty four hour ... center\nChargers on our allies span of died today at the age of Ninety five to seven of Greek immigrants rose from humble beginnings to become the top apartment elder across the nation and the owner of an NFL franchise he purchased the chargers in Nineteen eighty four\nAnd according to his family one of his most memorable moments was watching the chargers beat the Pittsburgh Steelers play in a Super Bowl\n...

the Ford after her testimony that had no evidence and corroborating witnesses [laughter]\nWe know that people who are survivors of sexual assault that did not happen do not experience justice for
