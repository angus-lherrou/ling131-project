like your health plan you get to keep their health plan with Obama carry your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dope\nUnwinding Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to essential Eby cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they want their doctor in play and it wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out of course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turns out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lines were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's status takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being

are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest\nHimself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn full decision how about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon disruptions and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousand tenet germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell when you think about as great a

going to reveal the proof and the evidence that Trump stole the election it's just how deranged they are\nThis is how distant and absent they are from common sense in reality\nThere's something not right about these people folks they've gone off the deep end collectively saw this is not just a a few Democrats of fuel left us this is pretty much all of them believed to one extent or another that Mueller has the goods because of the goods are there to be found\nEven though the media haven't been able to find a report on they've got this hope invested so now two or three different stories warning Democrats the lower their expectations\nAnd this latest one here from the week it's a it's a really long piece how the mother fairy tale endings\nUm the the author Matthew Walker hate Trump he's and bitter is bitter about having to admit that the investigation has gone nowhere\nThat's why is calling it the Mahler fairy tale [noise]\nThey really believe despite the absence of any evidence

it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's not good when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster but there's you know thousands of the line when he couldn't even see the end of the ... about her\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's great did you want to listen to NPR you wonder what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can do for\nWe've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I'm interested in NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said uh for the audience and and that happens while I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three\nWeeks [laughter] ah but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people who are these people we're\nBeing led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans Osama ... fleeing poverty war torn\nPoverty and the violence or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day assigning to leave and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings they just have a decent life you know in in in in ... and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremists cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an assault base screwed Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thing or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that\nTrump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this kind of thing but but for the media to act like this is a a normal\nNews event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\nWay most Ramos or whatever it is it in one is eight tell among do ... what what what is a ... ... what is it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know\nOn the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then there are different people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands

warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border\nThreatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] that they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that they they attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\n[noise] when when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in a group detour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this is going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this\nIt may make no sense it makes a word that cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned with hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two

rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done his work in a white has it worked that you can it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their wits
