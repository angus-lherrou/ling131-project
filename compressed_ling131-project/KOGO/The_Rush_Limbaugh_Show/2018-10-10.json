civil given the opposition the Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return just civility\nI mean they're making the case

anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify the people who want to be part of America not\nAnything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the

Ford for her allegation what message does that send to\nWomen and remember women went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary seven white women did\nI'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me\nWhite women went for Trump look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there and so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and the swerved in to a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I not to seat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America\nOn a test and they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the lightest and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm a poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh what\nWas done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on 'em and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking\nAt the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nHave you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws in reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take\nCases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most certainly example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats wouldn't Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because\nOur judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\nThe ass not by you in fact the\nHillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us return to civility Chris you're on on on poor listening to one another working on our differences\nVideo [laughter] not allowed to reveal who are who are members are we of course now\nKnow everything about our members but we're not allowed to divulge any of that information\nYou you you you don't have a chance to listen to you you basically check the website twenty four seven the app and the pod cast everyday\n[laughter] well I mean like I say I've been working I'm a fan of yours for thirty\nYears and I understand that sure yeah I um do you think you'll go you're listening to this program the podcasts and check the website and you watch the Trump rally and you hear Trump said things that you\nHeard or read on the ... my website is that right\nOh yeah I mean I hear him say the next thing that I Know he you know he's smart but he doesn't come up with south but so I Know I mean I can see him listening to your pod cast like in the morning when he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know\nIf the president listens to the podcast now he's told me he listens to the program and it gets a chance I mean he is is but\nYou know who knows what he's told me he does I I I've I'm very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I'm just I Want people to hear it how do you get the podcast everyday how your range to receive it\nWell I have your lap and I download your podcast\nRight there right there on the app right if it and it's not complicated is that you were able to figure it out\nNow you know I Would not have I mean I'm Sorry I was able to figure it out um I think you have fixed a few bucks which which are good the release you fix were good\nAnd we're constantly working on bug fixes we uh with the ... there's a new wave of them I've I've set up just the other day that the developer and and I said get this fixed I'm tired of waiting on it\nYeah it used to be if you were in your car and you're listening to our one and then our one runs out it wouldn't go automatically to our kids\nWell that now that interestingly that was not exclusive to us that happened to be the way they ended up being tagged and\nAnd we did have to change the way they got to have the download 'til you want to play back in the proper owner but that wasn't just our podcast it was any number of people that originally it was an eye Jones problem it was the way I tunes organize them\nOr we're ... able to overcome that with our with our own ... did you use I tunes ... got a straight to the ap\n[laughter] yeah I mean in fact I bought my first I thought you know I didn't even know what it was right and I bought it because that's how you're cast\n... doesn't want to people here that I Want to hear how easy it is and the cast is how would you describe the podcast\nTo what is it how would I describe what is it what are you listening to when you listen to the podcast\nOh well I mean I'm listening for what you say but you know it's not broken out by the commercials and things like that so I'm I'm getting your whole show I can get all the information about what's going on like you say I mean you\nWent what does it take you about an hour and a half to listen to the whole show our forty minutes\nI mean it's great because like I listen to it on the way home from our\nEye because her any commercials in a pod cast right it's just me\nWant to interfere with anybody want to go as soon as possible you have you know right nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails in this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia's just proves what a ... Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just abuse you of it but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump seemed to have any real interest since he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not convey proper information about him is his only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia or not only are you L. rush but but you are the voice of the mainstream media you should have the best that in part gas\nOr should have the ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that are basically\nLiberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound critic came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I'd see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal after some brushing barbarism again\nJust wanted to get your thoughts are so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is ... ... ... ... were trending one way or not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\n[noise] well uh it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all gotten fine and dandy what more do them\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties and know what\nAre they what not when what why are they what were they light when the Democrats weren't a Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time there they see a issue was a labor laws and um when what purpose\nMy part of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone in honor militants and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nI Want to let you hear if you didn't see it by the way Trump rallies Fox News this stopped carrying them now front to back if you noticed that you have to find a\nTrump rally either on I think one American news one American network or you can\nGet them on CSPAN but Fox no longer goes wall to wall I don't think there's anything about it to be said about I just think that they these things go on for an hour and a half and they don't stop to run commercials doing them and they are now campaign rallies\n[noise] since when they see the campaign seems so I think I think Fox is dialing back you know on the potential equal time claims even though there are Democrats doing rallies like this\nSo my point is that they're not as many people are seeing that men and last night this is such a contrast I have to tell you folks and I this was the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation of powers at all you can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time these are people that are up ... am happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them they want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally in your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that unforgettable picture to me of these kids\nAre slowing at the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon there aren't any gang banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get in\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the ... army or what but it was it was certainly nothing that was inspiring\nOr promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies or the exact opposite and I don't mean that people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people and they're they're having a good time and there is nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy people as a Democrat sponsored of an audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked\nOff\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minutes' worth the Trump rally crowd has find a way and it found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current about senator feisty this another [noise]\nUsually the documents well\n[noise]\nNo no no we didn't [noise]\nAnd I think\nThat don't get about five and can you blame [noise]\nWorst body language in other words did she lake it a hundred percent hand mattress join our students and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats [noise]\nYou don't hand matches through an arsonist you don't give power to an angry oh by the way that word mob left is is in in the Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss up on dictionaries in a wicked PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican the crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up ... trumpet daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so used to having it throw in a ride back at him with the same force they'd dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [laughter]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand sixty to two years ago two years exactly October tenth eleventh we have a montage fear of people

headline\nYesterday at the hill dot com the Republican House is in collapse that's the story that I have the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you wouldn't think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democrats' side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nSome women were there with their mothers somewhat their young children I was amazed at how many women were actually and it tends to\nFly by wire you amazed well\nI just keep hearing that the suburban women have completely left the Republican Party and that was in the exact opposite of what I witnessed last night of the political\nWhen I can imagine you were surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that the women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage innocent all that then you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nIt was I I don't know is that any feedback from any other Trump rallies that you get feedback from\nOr what about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there 'cause you detect that men were husbands are of a a for\nA guy that I was sitting next to brought us daughter he took a lot of small nights which brings daughter I was just amazed that I don't think that there's any massage any whatsoever of the Republican base I think that\nOf course there isn't this idea that this Republican war on women is a completely manufactured ally\nYou know Mitt Romney being asked in a debate by Stephanopoulos do they states ought to have the right to ban contraception wide who's talking about doing that George I don't care do you think so and Romney stumbled around somewhere it's finally made the mistake of answering the question Romney's says Exxon contraception Republican war on women\nWas really boring and ... it's absurd it's amazing the things they get away with the idea that the Republican Party he eats\nHalf the population I have never understood how that works how they pull that off in\nNon synthetic [noise]\nGlad you saw them
