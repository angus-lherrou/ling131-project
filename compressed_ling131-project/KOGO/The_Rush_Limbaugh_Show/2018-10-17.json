discussed in great detail yesterday and ...\nCame to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story I said you mean about the show he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how ... died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it is apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at an element of proving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate\nAnd then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible there is no way that ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession of his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to

percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife I network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently

Don moment is wrapped it up and got big mother is going to be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that is what they're hoping they were hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near\nThe ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWouldn't blow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\n\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein\nThanks rushed thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I have two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat [noise] I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter\nOut there for for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay go to the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against the seven anyway he um [noise] I became\nA a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically haven't overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my show people in the neighborhood because you said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really here and I can't understand why he is not addressed the nation [noise] I don't understand\nWait a minute when he was saying when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweak most at a time\nAnd the fresh prince ... they skew anyway so if he addressed the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well and that shocked geo right\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen or we can take bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read chore audio ... that he that he doesn't rage but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people are in the same boat\nWho are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea newscast and they\nWell I think that you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThat the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a wage is going up or my machine aging my\nPoint is I think you're going to be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can to hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say\nRussia probably by being met work we're listening to Rush Limbaugh on news radio six

morning\nMini series called press and is about two competing newspapers in the current era in this modern day and it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this is not about\nContemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current\nIn either country it is a\nModern era of generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than short trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these papers\nIn this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists to see it stopped call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that had me in their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or up a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs allowed if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved\nTo adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people to think about this series is it makes no bones about\nIt I I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave generally on us\nThis is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most they pick up all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life to him\nEverybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just as there they they have some kind of a relationship not particularly like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it\nAnd the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody is white [laughter]\nIt's amazing how this in the\nEyes of a journalist an editor now I imagine\nReal journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than be entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the pita file story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other favorite doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us Peter found just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have\nThe guts still running until the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of this press I have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um\nIt's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's gets faster because it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's a it's bad hit everybody everybody as a rubber ... including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's Donald Brazil now I Would I did not lose my place ... bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho those are the DNC the Democratic party who in her normal countenance would be out there so oh yeah boy wave Democrat's gonna win big gets it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she found\nSee how many days in a long time in politics [laughter] I'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble ... before I get my chickens why we still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout\nDemocratic victory depends on turnout among millennials one on a farm millennials voted in the last midterm we also got to make sure that we get paid way before we can get a boot Todd we need these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nYou asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats our target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nHelps put these numbers in that context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete picture\nOf registration for those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what that's all you need I mean if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's that seems like a little\nHope well we don't have a full database or numbers for to do so they say well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration if Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration because\nThere's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake and then a column from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull\nTrying to help the Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headlined will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\nWhat Megan McCarthy all in this op ed in the Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats is saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired on the Democrats because it alienated man and now she's warning the Democrats\nTo stop to hide their agenda of identity politics until they get into power she's telling you guys have got to put the masked back on your Democrats have got to read camouflage yourself she's warning the Democrats to hide the identity politics agenda of course we should fight\nMissed Adrian racism whether or not it's politically expedient these are important but the country faces lots of important moral questions Democrats can't answer them without first getting into power she's saying nice to have a shot up to stop your\nYour your everything's backfiring until you Democrats shut\nNews radio six hungry go go live local\nSchool shooting not in the U.S I'm Joshua looked into

upon himself to inform the American people what the drive by maybe were hiding\nThat she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened she couldn't describe the house where it was\nShe wasn't even sure of the year much less than a month she identified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met\nAfter this happened none of it all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive buys had not and that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cars which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny that were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports\nOver and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate her he simply\nReminded everybody and real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and cause the media has to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThen\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford van is she has no evidence there was nothing to support\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well a set of that one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said there were there to say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in Kavanaugh came in and of course his his re testimony is re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger forum on\n... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all of this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform when I'm appalled she was slithering around the dry buyers were they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause ... even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles for rule out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of\nTrump claiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump dead\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by is we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drawn Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the ... the prostitute porn star is paying Trump\nWho among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it\nIgnoring that the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees\nBut when Trump called her horse face in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump\nIs embarrassing goes there which sits kept talking about people that way so it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original tank or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take\nOn the record media says while it was very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible very compelling shantytowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she knows no evidence\nBlah blah by Trump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit a bit from the media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees the media was not reporting of being Trump win\nAnd remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin\nTrump campaign finance

this program has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia has it been confirmed not confirmed so they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music while they did all of this\nAnd of course until I blew up the theory and at the apple watch can paying the evidence they were going to try to make it look like proof existed in the form of audio recordings ... knew what was in store for him and it\nGoes apple watch the

to provide them cover\nThat's\nIt's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\n\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media
