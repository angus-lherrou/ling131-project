kinds of things no longer\n[noise] bother me other than the ... I I I Do get concerned it there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe\nHas destroyed the futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted life it's distorted gender differences and has distorted the concept of happiness victim allergy it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's the and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question where Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and plenty plenty a Eric Holder the attorney general for Iraq who same all\nInvolved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side ... so called conservative intelligentsia shock\nThan Eric Holder was saying what he said\nYou know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high\nAnd homeowners said screw that when they go low meaning Republicans when they go low we kept them\n\nSo peoples of mine got these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally\nI was saying that we can't take it anymore we after Scott being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama method when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people wouldn't get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators\nThey're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to one by one day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe resigned in the poll indicated that house races are over there are poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they most won the Senate\nThey have the Mueller report and the Mueller report is going to link Trump to Russia right they know that Mueller's got the\nGoods all they can taste it fall folks they can scratch their bags with it they just camp is aid and all that Mueller\nHas secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's going to tie Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\n\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\n\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing that's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing in New York and get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a\nTwo thousand five the drive by media proclaim Kanye West the smartest man in pop music\nHip hop class act\nThe firing the rules of rap Kanye West goes his own way [noise] so what would I be Thirteen Years ago Kanye West was in the future\nKanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump asked is Jim Brown\n\nBy the way Trump was funny the Trump Trump pose a why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why do you can Trump said you know what\nYou have a point but there were people that have been lined up for a day and a half to get into this either I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time\nTrump to slam dunk to them on a number of things in a short little press availability at the White House\nSo now\nA CNN handle calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListened black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft okay they've had it with ... said\nAll of a sudden cognac because he's put on a ... hat and he's\nHe's in a catcher in the horror like the president he's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson he's talking negro the Trump Administration is ridiculous\nSays the CNN panel wider so mad folks\nWhy all the desperation they're going to win the house are going to win the Senate Muller is going to prove that Trump colluded with Russia\n\nBetween inciting violence is launching a racist attacks we're witnessing an attempt to bully the American population of surrender that is what's happening here\nThey're soft who failed\nNow it's time for the second phase the soft coup that swear Rosen staying in the rest of the guys are gonna wiretapped Trump and going to wire Trump wear a wire and get Trump indicting himself for certain things he was saying they're going to get rid of Trump the FBI the deal Jay the Clinton Administration the soft coup in your work\n\nRemaining silent about the

joint Republican Democrat baseball game of Thrones ... traditional annual thing\nAnd a lunatic deranged Democrat fundraiser donors supporter from Illinois shows up starts firing and almost killed ... and the Democrats didn't say anything about it\nIn the media didn't condemn it there wasn't any condemnation there was there was an overwhelming silence that shouldn't have been and it was to me a clue\n\nThe Democrat depravity merit attention so now we've got Hillary now we've got Maxine Waters Erin Cole\n[noise] Hudson Valley man arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up

to tell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name as ... a shell game that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it\nAnd it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... and kiss Yogi not common cause show game is as a as a Saudi or Arab name and then they show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a\nA lifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer adamant that the source of his wealth which was made to look like a jet setting party animal\nBy Robin Leach so whether whether Jim aka show is related to him and I couldn't even find out just habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince in Saudi Arabia his father is the king king ...\nHe is the brother of the late ... king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these\nGuys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying\nTheoretically to reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and a oil focused because the world\nIs expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things uh Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states he spent a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know always wind and dying the Google guys is winding dined Facebook guy spent a lot of time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company that is made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last I think it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it\nDo to corruption and connections in stores he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin so I'm not\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\n... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the hidden supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family

greats\nImprovements that will happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise] right here Nancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house [noise] now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well\nI'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want reinventing not a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... in the Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or hide\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the non and last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I Know what\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense he's saying on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan is it the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like an old game we don't have any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to say there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same knock that and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump everything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they are in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right one were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs if we don't go up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough and they could not go up that's the only way they win but Republican conservative stand up\nWent every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to

morning with facts and friends of president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington if he'd distrust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... there's just not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance\nSo ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west weighing on notice\nA\nTrump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I don't want to jump ahead let's go to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams\nSorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise]\nThis is Trump calling in to Fox and friends today is talking to Steve do see a do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we have thousands of people lined up by the time either making decisions on my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already\nThat I'm not coming and I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and you know that area obviously has not affected at all by it we added on a great control I don't think it's really\nHot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people have lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nThe next question or from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr\nPresident started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics to\nBe careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's willing to discuss things safe and for him to make a very dangerous taping older [laughter]\nIs held in contempt by Congress colder when after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled with the IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to talk to like this\nIn the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans at Wimbledon away or not even acknowledge porn or they would say\nWe strongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric co authored by law attorney general holder written ... ... ... ... much although totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely unilaterally condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nHe'd better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I could he'd better be careful\nWhat he's wishing now the stock market's been kind of see song it's been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks\nThere are a number of wealthy Democrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous\nCaller said and of course it it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it I Believe it looking aren't\nPulling people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just\nTo ... but the Republicans in the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market's a roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or at four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression when is the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter]\nDon't forget Obama's was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm paying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when\nThe economy's going great my whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so frightening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time totally unnecessary for right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve

one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your

us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nUrban some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not only that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even a letter to the times that there is a chance there was a very good chance that that was written by the time so I wouldn't be surprised 'cause at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself\nWrote that piece that memo that supposedly memo written by an angry staffer\nIn the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal things the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we love business\nAnd they started a massive manhunt\nTo find out who did this and they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first day would ever go back and check the transcript\nAnd I just really I Am still fired up especially with the

minute\nFor the money\nYou got it and it was but I see that [noise]\nNew York magazine and looking at is Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected\nAnd he's sixteen election results is is not a where he is looking back what's what's retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir and the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not going to sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes and we've counted the boats they wanted\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nThis have you with knowledge of going up as a result of the election of course I'm a great American ... that go since at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win a landslide than my the soundbite would be the headline we covered knowledge is likely to feed their upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up they said no\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy the member\nDid believe is saying there is this is an unwritten so then Obama we didn't know until recently\nDevised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from him\n\nIn October two thousand sixty in seeing your staff and the Obama White house\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the result\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate was Clinton October the nineteenth he said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo laser rice to cry and forestall a political crisis by validating the election results so\nThis is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ...\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were going\nTo get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell and cause a laser rice\n\nIn the event the Trump tried to disputed Clinton victory they would have fun resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot\nWe're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place and\nNo matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're going to use it if Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that\nWas going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame Bolton she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russia that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede river she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this story\nGo to ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nAs a firefighter roughly up oriented firehouse subs introducing new
