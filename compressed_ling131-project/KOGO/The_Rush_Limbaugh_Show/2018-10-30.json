that the\nImplication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote again a classic expression or\nIllustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump button back we'll get to more details that I ... back to my little test so I rented of these people at the event last night it's going to\nBe a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red way but I said I Hope you're right but let\nMe let me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairmen and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party that\nHolds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they caved in\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now has reelect and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\n\nAnd then you've got a contest among races are in in other parts of Senate of course now they're saying now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're\nAware of this they knew about the resign resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump know exactly what's at stake they're not going to send home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected\nTo office and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nMember of my great\nBook great in the presidential election in two thousand six team was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity name\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movement and the great awakening movement and he\nGoes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red\nPill a movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in an electorate that's unhappy and angry and looking for a radical change\nAt least that has been the case\nOr in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive\nBuys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations ah the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy our would argue that Democrats and the media think it\nIs a problem\nThere's talk all over ... that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these falls\nSurprises he calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was ... do we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump\nOr we have the October surprises the usually the caravan of crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these false surprises and other events\nWhile intending to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans\nAnd let's see uh park neighborhood was shot early this morning when they were selling reporting partner to news he woke up to the noise\nAround and started banging on another door smashing the glass that's when the homeowners shop the man in the back the man was arrested taken

birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S the mothers who are not citizen\nCitizens Trump made the comments during an interview asked on HBO\nStating America's the only country in the world

defending himself after being accused of igniting the hate that fueled the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh he said in an interview with Fox News that it's ridiculous to linked him to the shooting in any way because of his own Jewish ties and support\nThe president said he's looking forward to visiting Pittsburgh today and would have done so sooner if it wasn't such a distraction to

L. roofing dot com a rush fans don't forget joined me Sean\nHannity today at noon right here on news radio six hundred\n[noise]\n\nAnd\nBack to the phones week oh this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThank you rush I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are running the miss impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\n... it it it it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it\nYet right 'cause what's causing this is causing a discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody that this is one pushing back is going to look like so\nWhat you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July Nineteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are closed up we're still restricted the plaques that essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThen we're going to formally recognize former slaves the citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished\nAnd that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration\nFrom the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans they didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians as they did though but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique\nAmerican culture which is rooted in western civilization that's what's different now there is no interest in that\n[noise] we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got to come together we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being Senate that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters a\nPre shit that call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you appreciate and with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that is in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nI don't make the solution to this is enterprise zones\nIn Arizona door or Guatemala uh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but\nThere isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another\nAnd this is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... and\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's if people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet but\nUnderstand that they'd be one's heart political theory and economic\nMakes sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know a wider George Soros I mean George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life for these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to it to invoke damage\nOn the United states protect generally Trump into advanced the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network Hi\n[laughter] Hi yes fresh uh two years ago my husband and I adopted for an extra ... who were in foster care and we had had him a

they realize it is a is is is fine with me its course it's it's [noise] um once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on the less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we owe\nAnd so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't\nAnyway appreciate

I thought I saw\nAbout ... Michigan Militia shortwave radio networks what the excuse\nWas so now that's become a me we have here is this a montage\n[noise] yep we got a bunch of CNN people and some National Review people uh radicalizing St ... saying that Trump is radicalizing domestic terrorists just like ISIS listen to this\nWhat are we learning about how the Pittsburgh suspect was radicalized\nThese men appear to have been radicalized these men appear to have been radicalized\nRadicalized people seeing what the president has appointed I thought that thanks\nWhether it's Sarah Huckabee or Donald Trump the half truth thing leads to people getting radicalized who is radicalizing people in America Donald Trump certainly a parent's responsibility\nFor the bomber was radicalized into sort of this Trump super fan community where president has radicalized so many more people than I did\nI off there she is with ah or I guess the ... she pronounces you off his shoes GQ and I think she's a followed jive\nYes G. Q. writer Julia your feet Trump is radicalized many more people than ISIS she said that while I was a guest on CNN and then she apologizes for claiming Trump was radicalized more people than ISIS\nShe apologized or Monday shortly after claiming a on the air but Trump has radicalized more people than\nISIS Twitter blow up after she made the comments since I don't I used to be one Twitter blow up it was all liberals that was all leftists you know Twitter is blowing up ad leftists all over the place now\nHere's the next one CNN Tonight with Don Lemon speaking with the former Republican National committee chairman Ryan ... might shield\nAnd Washington Post columnist Max Boot about the links between Trump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue sugar\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that are political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violent that's a very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack we always ask what radicalized and what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists\nAnd you could not divorced the actions of the second ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's max boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic terrorists\nYou can't divorce the actions of these people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\n\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this\nThe moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs they're being nobody on our side doing this as we did kill us\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable to dispatch Trump\nAnd it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftist so Hillary Clinton ... always just one way street there's always you don't want to root it invokes it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this program\nDating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I ... valley and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in\nThe presumption up superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other\nBut you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh damp or criticized made fun I'm mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto would\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd that we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that ...\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it in the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied\nYou or is the reason that this is all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now you're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity\nI watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here in Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe needy I hated\nIt was in response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these big gets what repeal is to make a cake or take photos on a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when ... when when Indiana passes along Pence who's the governor the media was outraged and they\nBegan to report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out\nPost of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude know thing that they do wear what they report in the way they report it and what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the ah the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it\nAnd then they ran around and they started knocking on doors asking businesses\nWouldn't you bake a pizza when you when you make a piece of ... and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her famous no\nWe wouldn't know it would be against them so they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana big it\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive way and in his leash she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd we're racists bigots sexist home of pubs I Know exactly what the ultimate Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well\nAnd so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is al heartily endorse it and er and accepted and it's this arrogance\nAnd just the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have\nA synagogue shooting while the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the\nWay it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal winning increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition spent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right than their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our site still want a cow town at the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of one of the media as being nice to 'em or not it's frustrating to no end when I run into people like that and they're out there but the electoral\nResults just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what's [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris ...
