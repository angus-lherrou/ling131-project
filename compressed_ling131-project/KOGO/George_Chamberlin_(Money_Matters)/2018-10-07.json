study was arrested by the hotlines one eight feet deep the links that's one ...\n... five four six five suffer\nWith Albert and this is the community could actually\nUse peyote am why my\nDuring a\nTwelve noon into Google News ... there is a new Facebook hopes going around and it's targeting your inbox\nOkay well as it turns out the Dow and the S. and P. five hundred for all in intents and purposes we're an changed\nFor the five day period okay yeah we got beat up bruised and battered the last two days but they don't even talk about the first three days of the week but those of you that I listen to this program for a while know that that's hardly a surprise that sort of the way that they do it\nSort of the way that the boys and girls in the financial media do it they just kind of\nJust kind of let it go that way and uh and so we just have to use this little forum that I have here to explain that it really wasn't as bad as you are are led to believe that really really wasn't all that bad\nAnd we'll give you another example of that uh in in a little while and we talk about the end climate report that came out on friday\nSo I'm ... we're we're near all time record high territory for the major indexes the NASDAQ ... the NASDAQ did have a really bad week last week it dropped three point two percent okay\nUh they they they will gladly tell you about that but they won't tell you that the Dow in the S. and P. five hundred were basically unchanged for the week so that's what we get to live with out there\nBut we did have a a tough week for a tech stocks\nCatholic got clobbered [laughter] he line mosque can't get out of his own way and we had a lot of selling and Amazon dot com and a couple of other stocks that uh are key components to the to the NASDAQ a lot of the tech stocks had a pretty rough week last week okay some it happens\nA ... it's just the way it goes up but as far as the the more blue chip oriented stocks they kind of hung in there and uh and did okay\nI'm I've got it written down here in in some more detail but I Can't put my fingers on it right now\nAll right so let's talk about a couple of economic reports that came out in the past week and the big one we had we had lots of jobs reports a lot of reports coming out\nAbout the labor market and for the most part it was pretty good but then we got on friday the ... like for instance I think the ATP report that came out on Wednesday which measures um employment or in the in the private sector\nI think it showed it was up by like two hundred and thirty thousand so hope was springing eternal that we would get a really a a really big increase when the department of labor or put out its report on friday\nWe didn't we got a number that showed that non farm payrolls rose by a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month way below what had been expected okay\nAnd so that really did knock the steam out of the market as one of the things that led to the decline that we saw on friday by the way at one point in time on friday the Dow was down three hundred and twenty points they finished with a loss of like a hundred and eighty points okay but what\nWhat most of the people in the media don't do is pay attention to the details they just look at the headline I'm Leo\nBarely mackerel payrolls we're only by a hundred and thirty four thousand that's the flu or the fewest number we've seen in a year this is this is terrible this is really really terrible we're not we're nobody's ... there's no jobs being out there and and they just were where beside themselves okay\nBut if you look at the data what they do every month\nIs go back and revise the numbers let me get out of ... because I Need to do some math here and just sick and then I Can't do it off the top of my head here so we'll take that number there with me we'll take that number or one thirty four and add to it\nAnd add to it eighty seven\nOne's eleven twelve\nOkay All right so um they announced that in the two previous months which would have been July and August they revise those numbers on a regular basis they do it every month the two previous months are revised\nAnd they revise that show that during July and August jobs were uh were created a much faster pace than originally had been reported eighty seven thousand more jobs added than previously reporting so let's add that eighty seven\nTo one thirty four and you come up with a number two hundred and Twenty one thousand increase in payrolls\nWhy don't these geniuses that worked for barons and worked for the wall Street Journal pay attention to this stuff why don't they get that as much weight as they do just just going ballistic saying that a non farm payrolls increase by a hundred and thirty four thousand when they missed a great opportunity said by\nIf you add in the river visions it really does make the number\nLook a lot better\nI'm not trying to paint a rosy picture here I'm just trying to\nTo give you the the the bottom line and the other thing on this is the unemployment rate last month fell to three point seven percent\nHow about this the lowest rate has been since Richard Nixon was president of the United states forty nine years ago the unemployment rate was three point seven percent\nWow how 'bout\nThat forty nine years ago Neil Armstrong walked on the moon for the first time\nOkay forty nine years ago the unemployment rate was three point seven percent\nThat's where it is now and you know what it's probably going to go lower than that All right let's take a break and we'll come back we got a lot more to talk about a lot of interesting things going on out there so I Do stay with us I'm George Chamberlain thanks for joining us our news radio six hundred Coco\nFrom B.

little supply of homes\nA lot uh Fifteen and twenty percent down it's causing a lot of people not be able to buy a home for all those reasons plus obviously people have to rent\nAnd if you're in a landlord you're probably on the cat bird seed as we would say because the landlord can raise ... said we'll have a single act like what's been happening over the last couple of years\nGeorge you and I know I'm Gary London\nWho's a real estate economist and I had to carry on our show a couple of months ago and he was mentioning that when he was a student at George at Cal Berkeley as he was introduced to rent control he said he really really loved it kept his rent down\nAnd then after school he moved to San Diego only defined that are about half the homes in the bay area are still and rent controls has been no appreciation or the building and ... it's just been terrible because the landlords who take all the risk\nA need to make a little profit in the ... at least to stay even\nAnd with his potential rent controls is going to be on the November the ... ballot\nA it's a it could hurt a nationally appears to her help renters but in the long term hurts everybody George\nYeah it it

hundred six hundred five six for six or in the metro area eight five eight area code five six nine eight to five five give me a call would love to talk with you today [noise]\nAll right let's deal with another one of the great myths out there [laughter]\nI spend all my time correcting things\nDon't I it seems like that's what I Do anyway [noise] um what what what have you been told over and over again people are moving out of California in copious quantities they just can't afford to live in California any longer okay\nThat's what we're told\n[noise] there's a a new survey that came out this past week from a a United movers there a a a big mover moving company a United van lines\nAnd uh they put this report out every year I think in any way and so let me just read you the headline and see what what's what's wrong with this statement\nAmericans are moving westward\nSay what Americans are moving westward flocking to the mountain and Pacific west while the northeast and Midwest continue to lose residents well now wait a minute that cannot be true that cannot be true nobody can afford to live in California\nEverybody's moving to the mid west because that's where you can buy houses cheaply you can you can rent cheaply it's ... ... nobody's moving to the west coast\nWell these people wouldn't know wouldn't be okay because they're a moving company they move people okay and where are they moving to to the mountain and Pacific west in two thousand Seventeen more residents moved\nOut of Illinois than any other state with sixty three percent of moves being out bound\n\nLook at the at the reports and I look at a report we get regularly from um [noise] ... it shows that Illinois is one of the cheapest places to rent and to buy homes right now\nBut sixty three percent of movies that are handled by by a United vans and storage sixty three percent senator Mozart how bound out of Illinois\nVermont has the highest percentage of inbound and a migration in two thousand Seventeen sixty eight percent of moves to and from the state being inbound a those are the results of the United van lines forty first annual national mover study which tracks\nCustomers state to state migration patterns over the past year as a region mountain west continues to increase in popularity with fifty four percent being in about the west represents the highest inbound last\nUh the the the west is represented on the inbound list by Oregon sixty five percent Idaho sixty three percent Nevada sixty one percent Washington fifty nine percent or ...\nOf a move to Oregon the highest ranking western state a new job or a company transfer and proximity to family led the reasons for most inbound most now obviously\nA California is not going to be high on that list but we ... what we need to to remind you is that California is not on the moving in or moving out west okay according to this or this or\nReport from a from United a moving out the top outbound states for two thousand Seventeen or Illinois New Jersey New York Connecticut Kansas Massachusetts\nOhio Kentucky Utah and Wisconsin so California didn't even make the top ten for about ... and the states where people were moving into Vermont Oregon Idaho Nevada and\nSouth Dakota Washington South Carolina North Carolina low after the after that a big storm that just worked through there or maybe not so much and then ... a Colorado and Alabama wow\nOkay Illinois sixty three percent of the moves in Illinois moved up one spot on the outbound list to number one\nA rake ah raking in the top five for the past nine nine years so it it's very interesting because if if you were to just walk down the streets of alcohol\nBecause I remember we we I remember we I I talked about this on the program a about a year ago probably and uh uh one of our listeners are I think in a range of Santa Fe said\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned that this company because my husband worked for them I Believe she said for many many years and one of the things that have been so great was the dividend we received from this company and alec kept growing and growing and growing year after year after year\nThe company we're talking about is a company that most of us probably never heard of okay\nCompany is called R. P. M. international RPM International and they just recently announced that they are increasing their um their ... and\nFor the forty fifth consecutive year raising the payout by nine points four percent\nWow that's a big increase from one year to the next\nUh this action marks rpm forty fifth consecutive year of increased cash dividends for shareholders which places rpm inability or ... elite category of less than half of one percent of all publicly traded companies\nWhat elite category does it put them in only forty one other companies besides rpm have consecutively paid an increasing vivid and for this period of time or longer according to the emergent handbook of dividend achievers\nDuring that time the company has returned approximately two point four billion dollars in cash dividends to its shareholders at its current price of around sixty dollars a share rpm dividend yield would be to point three percent\nFrank Sullivan who's the chairman of the board of directors said that the annual increasing annually increasing our cash dividend\nIs one of the primary ways that we deliver value to our shareholders it's the it is key to our ability to consistently drive long term growth\nAnd I've performed the cumulative total return of the broader market and that's what dividends are all about folks I mean we've talked about this for a long long time but that's really what dividends are all about by raising the debt and obviously they can only do that if they're burning\nBurning the them the money\nAnd therefore in order to share it with you they have to have to be able to uh find a way to pay it you don't want to borrow money to increase your dividend that's that that's a stupid that's what it is but you're looking at a really significant increase for a company like rpm\nUm you know honestly I I didn't print the whole thing here\nUh the whole press release but um\n[noise] to be honest with you I I Can't remember what it is this company [laughter]\nBut whatever it is they're making more money from the from whatever they do and they sell this stuff\nAh so it may be the the lady who heard me talk about this last year will give me another call that\nEight hundred six hundred five six four six eight hundred six hundred five six for six or in the metro area eight five eight ... area code five six nine eight to five five um we got a report out at the end of each quarter we get a report from standard and Poor's\nA and Dow Jones about a dividend payouts okay and they they look at what has happened and so this past week we got a report that said um [noise] uh\nAs in the Dow Jones indices announced that the indicated David and net increase\nFor us domestic companies was Nineteen born two billion dollars during the third quarter of two thousand Eighteen up from an increase of Thirteen billion dollars for the second quarter of this year\nAnd a Fifteen billion dollars from the third quarter of last year\nIn other words more and more companies are paying out dividends and more and more companies are increasing their dividend\nThere were record earnings for the first two quarters of two thousand Eighteen with four ... with a forward street estimates and corporate guidance indicating records for both the current quarter the third quarter and the fourth is according to Howard silver black who is the senior index analyst at the S. and P.\nThrough record amounts uh they'll record amounts had been paid and dividends and buybacks buybacks appear to be a be favorite I don't agree with that is all Howard and I don't ever disagree with Howard 'cause he's a very smart man\nAs David and payouts have declined and are are estimated to tick down now companies do both companies increased dividends\nAnd they buy back outstanding
