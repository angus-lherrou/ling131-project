forty four for the Dow Jones industrial average right now okay that's\nThat's obviously off its high at one brief moment in time a about a month ago we touched on twenty seven thousand\nUh but uh again we've gone up and down up and down in in there and so that's kinda the thing that has been going on as of late we had a lot of economic News I'm looking at a [noise]\nA a recap of the week from um a fidelity\nDot com and actually this report came from of course marketwatch dot com which is owned by the wall Street Journal and um there were a lot of economic events during the week okay a lot of economic events during the week and in their recap of the week\nThey ignored all of them are they well they ignored all the good ones okay so here's this article from a from a suit Chang who is a writer along with Chris Matthews not not that Chris Matthews I'm In their recap\nUh for the the week that that was and they go well what drove the mark oh let's go with that what drove the market well they point out immediately that existing home sales fell three point four percent in August oh the humanity according to the national association of realtors\nA corporate earnings have been had been healthy they point out with more companies reporting better than expected earnings per share\nAbove the five year average uh let's see what else was going on oh China China China's gonna eat our lunch right okay a China main equity benchmarks posted there ... or the best posted\nTheir best daily gain since early August to end the week on a high no well how about that [noise]\nUh let's see at China's GDP grew six and a half percent and then I I I I'm just looking at this for the first time right here\nAnd uh they don't uh point out that the usual comment I mean remember our economy is growing at about three and a half to four percent rate which right now which is gang busters\nChina's GDP grew by six point five percent right now you look at that\nAnd the usually the immediate comment as well you know you really can't cross\nEconomic reports out of China or whatever [noise]\nUh let's see then they go on and they talk about oh there's a the Italian bond market there's bears that going on over there so they didn't bother to mention and hear any of the really I mean really good news that we had last week so let me do it for them okay how about this [noise]\nThis is this is almost beyond comprehension but we'll we'll do this one and there I've got so much good news about the economy to tell you about that I I'm not going to get 'em all in here\nBefore we have to take our break here uh but let's go with the one that is just\nA blockbuster blockbuster report job openings there's this report that I Love to talk about because I Love this report is called the jolt report job openings and labor turnover survey okay what they're able to do is calculate I have no idea how they do this\nBut they calculate the number of jobs that are available at the end of a particular months so we're going to be looking here at the August number end of August report okay and this comes from the department of labor I think it I I think from the department of labor with the Census Bureau or something like that okay [noise] ah\nThe number of job openings in the United states rose had they had to throw this one in here rose slightly\nActually it was way more than slightly but that's the way that this report their side\nOr the number of a job openings in the U.S rose slightly to a record\nSeven point one for a million jobs in August reflecting strong growth and the economy and the best labor market in in a decade job openings topped seven million in July for the first time ever\nRevised figures show so so we got the August numbers but we also got the they go back and they revise the numbers\nAnd so we now know that in July or we had seven million job openings in other words in other words there were more jobs available at the uh in July and August\nThan there were people looking for work\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I I don't know I I don't know what more I can add to that I really don't know what more I can add to that job openings increasing government construction financial services healthcare and professional services\nA job openings declined slightly in retail manufacturing and the restaurant business though they were still at high levels over all\nThe other thing they have in here is what they call their the quits a report which is the number of people who voluntarily quit their job\nThat rose to a Seventeen year high to point seven percent of all workers in the private sector quit their jobs during the month of August why did they do that\nA well because they knew they had skills and that they could get a new job they probably already had a new job lined up and so they quit their old jobs\nAnd that's just absolutely amazing amazing stuff and um I I like to have a lot of fun with ... talking about the jokes report but I can kind of bet\nThis may be the first you're hearing about it\nBecause uh uh a lot of other media outlets don't talk about the jokes report or anything good for that matter okay so let me take a break

don't think they even I I don't know maybe they still have the the name ... in there but this is a a company that got started back in Eighteen\nNinety two while [noise] and um it was the first a consumer a company to have an IP oh a back way back when uh in Nineteen oh six so anyway\nUm ... it went through a lot of good times and a lot of times that we're not so good\nI think I think it was in two thousand five yeah I'm In two thousand five Sears bought Kmart\nAnd that was sort of the beginning of the hat and uh unfortunately uh and uh they've never been able to to rally from that because they kept\nFor the most part I think they kept running their operations the way they did back in Eighteen Ninety two I I just don't think it ever really really went well in Nineteen eighty nine that's when ah when they uh when Wal Mart a and it\nBecame a bigger retail operation than Sears was and then it by two thousand Seventeen Sears was the twenty third largest retailer in the United states you can see the line you know it just keeps going down down down\nAnd got to the point where they filed for bankruptcy I'm On a friday couple of other things uh\nOut this it it just it just never seemed to ride it never ever seemed right\nK-mart for a long time I was a leader in retail it was even a for a long time a leading the the fight with Wal Mart and what Walmart was able to do that neither Sears or or Kmart\nOr anybody else could do was figure out a way to\n... to modernize what they do the Walmart figure it out the Internet\nAnd right now they're giving they're giving Amazon dot com a serious serious run for their money on line\nThey're doing a great job Walmart is really captured the whole thing okay I mean Amazon is a big dog and and I doubt that Wal Mart will ever be as big as Amazon but they're really doing a great job and they're they're really aggressively marketing themselves online and doing a lot of other things as well so\nYou know it is a totally different operation and Kmart never did that k-mart said hey we got a good thing going here we we love our stores and people love our stores and they come into our store as well not so much anymore\nAnd so that's led to the situation they're um they're going to be closing more stores it's in it and know that said they are ready to close another one hundred and forty two stores toward the end of this year and then begin liquidation sales after that perhaps a they have right now five hundred stores\nA Kmart and Sears stores across the country five hundred stores I Wonder what it was at

so do tune is and if you're already doing that right now\nLet's let's take the rest of this hour next is eight nine minutes or so and uh spend it talking about uh the the anniversary\nI don't I don't know that I Would say we celebrated this anniversary but it was the anniversary on friday and I I I very so very very rarely used this term\nBut it applies in this case it was uh in Nineteen eighty seven on October nineteenth that the stock market crash you\nKnow their way to put it the stock market crashed on black Monday Monday October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven what happened on that day [noise] well I'm not sure what happened on that day other than the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average fell a total of five hundred and eight points\nYou're going hey Chamberlain what's the big deal we met we had a five hundred appoint a drop in the market that this past week wise what's what what are you getting all excited about it well that five hundred and eight point\nA drop at that point in time on October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven represented a loss of twenty two point six percent in market value today a five hundred point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average is maybe a two percent decline\nThis was twenty two point six percent\nAnd the Dow Jones industrial average on that date finished\nAt one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight\nOne thousand seven hundred and thirty eight today we're at twenty six thousand let's say it's a we're a little bit below that but we're right around twenty six thousand back then we finished out one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight\nThat was ugly that was ugly but it also created one of the greatest buying opportunities that you'll ever know or you will ever be able to reflect back on in your lifetime let me give you an example of one\nOne stock wants to talk of the apple a on\nOctober Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven\nApple closed at thirty six dollars and fifty cents a share thirty six dollars and fifty cents a share so a hundred shares would have cost you three thousand six hundred and fifty dollars okay All right today that one hundred shares if you if you bought a hundred shares on that day\nToday you would have a total of\nTwo thousand one hundred shares as a result of to stocks but they did a two for one stock split in two thousand and five and in two thousand fourteen did a seven for one stock split so you do the math on that today you would have two thousand\nOne hundred shares of apple stock you bought a hundred for three thousand six hundred and fifty dollars and are just doing nothing on just sitting there being a lump all of a sudden you have two thousand one hundred shares of Apple's stock\nThat is worth\nFour hundred and sixty two thousand dollars did you have to do anything other than sitting on your rear end ...\nApple stock went from a hundred shares of apple went from three thousand six hundred and fifty dollars that you would have paid for it on that day\nTo today being worth more almost uh almost a half a million dollars wow wow that's what investing is all about my friends that is what investing is all about you know not every stock that kind of a return obviously\nBut I can pretty much guarantee that with the exception of stairs [laughter] pick any stock and uh and you probably have done pretty well\nPick any of the the thirty stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average and you probably\nWould be a pretty happy camper and you didn't have to do a darn saying\nNo I take that back you did have to do something you had to fight the constant urge to sell\nCars you are thinking it's going to crash again isn't it it's going to crash again and we were fortunate enough we were so lucky to get into apple shares or any you know a Microsoft any anyone you pick any of the thirty stocks back then\nAnd all you had to do is fight the constant urge to sell\nBecause selling is the mortal enemy of the long term investor\nAnd yet I Know it happened in Nineteen eighty seven\nIt happened in two thousand eight and two thousand nine when we were in the great recession and we had a tremendous drop in the stock market not a crash but we lost fifty percent over a period of a a a time or in the market value of the Dow Jones industrial average but you didn't\n... you didn't sell you had to fight\nThe urge to sell which most people don't most people let their emotions determine their investments and yet if you you you just look at that example of apple a going from three thousand six hundred and fifty dollars to\nAlmost a quarter or a half a million dollars rather almost a half a million dollars what did the the successful investor do this ... successful investor didn't do anything\nJust sat back and said okay this is a good company I like this company I like what they're doing they've discovered something new and exciting and it's just gonna keep getting better and better and they ... and you just\nYou just put on the blinders sit back and let magic happened and that's what investing is all about that is what it's all about there's a lot of things going on with the market right now and I want to go back and revisit a the genius of Peter Lynch a in\nThe next part of our program but we're also going to open up our phones now I've been ... for an hour I Want to open up our phone lines so that you can call in agree disagree with any of the things I said so far or if you have questions about your investment what is going on right\nNow I should you wait until after the election [noise] [laughter]\nJust as I said that I was thinking I just think what happened after the last election we had a couple of years ago and what the stock market did then huh\nWho manages a ... a multibillion dollar\nA fund okay and um he's he's out there saying that\nUh there was no bubble in stocks the bubble isn't bonds and boy I'm just going to lay on buddy\nYou are so right let me just read a couple of lines to this billionaire hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman\nI'm offered a bad assessment that uh the bonds are the bubble not the stocks okay he uh he offered that uh uh assessment on Wednesday in an interview on CNBC well how'd at CNBC ever allow somebody on the air who's optimistic that's just not allowed\nIn which you also argue that stocks are fundamentally cheap\nFollowing a US led global equity route last week many investors last week argued that a rapid rise and the ten year treasury note\n[laughter]\nTo three ... three point two percent help spark a sharp decline that saw the Dow Jones industrial average lose

argue that the economy and we quote here if\nAnything is too strong and that the\nConditions that normally lead to a big decline\nWell they're just not present I Love that way\nTo go way to go by the way to be honest and and the sticking with your guns and more than anything else congratulations on during an interview with CNBC\n'cause usually they don't want to talk to anybody who's a who's who's a who's bullish I was watching Fox Business and Liz claim it I think it is\nYeah it's been federally going up and I we don't have any that Congress elected initial money\nA lot of February ... find
