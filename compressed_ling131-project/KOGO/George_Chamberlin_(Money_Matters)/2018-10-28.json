{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "Um it you won't always feel something um and then we don't want people to think oh well I checked myself and I'm fine but you should know what's normal if something changing are you feeling pain is they're just charges there alone is the color changing you know you should know what's normal for you and then maintaining a healthy lifestyle is also really important\n[noise] so so if they want and low yeah go ahead oh\nFor me I I'd always been told you're looking for a lump or a pie and so it feels like a pie are hard to hard rock and mine did not feel like that and so when I felt when I felt it was like well it's not only for a piece of if not you know nothing's wrong and I really want people to know if you feel anything faith in the front of a norm they'll get fast and if I Know what's going on\nThere you mentioned earlier the terms of doctors you know they they see it all the time\nThat they may not be maybe a sensitive and doctors are as different as everybody else that you deal with but ah she shouldn't on your experience dealing with the medical care literally probably that you do you think the you know doctors are still have something to learn or are they all\nPretty equal what advice when somebody calls us to share what do I go\nYeah um I mean San Diego's very lucky we have a ... a great community here with a lot of options um four to receive care um but I Do think that there is a little bit of onus on the patient advocate and to ask questions and to get clarification\nI'm there also are things where you know you maybe go on your oncologist for one thing but talking to somebody else about I'm Natasha or um you know during your radiation but needing to talk to somebody else about the cream that you use on your skin and so um you know you are the sort of um\n[noise] nexus of all of that information and as the patient at it it falls on you to kind of coordinate that but I think that doctors I'm here in San Diego to a great job and I'm you know are are doing that the best that we can and we're very lucky to have so many state of the art I'm ... researchers as well as practitioners\nAnd there was a lot of research going on here and there isn't there\nYet we have um a ton of research for Komen funded research at I UCSD as well as a sock Institute and at the Sanford Burnham medical research Institute\nOr lonely and I'm sure you've learned a tone of off the summit obviously you're some pretty wise what it comes to genes that everything else\nBut I Want to say and I do do run is a process where you have to learn but the physicians that I had were amazing um they were very supportive and a lot of the programs now they they give you a nurse navigators so you're able to to really attached to one person who then helps you were you through the pet scans and this\nAnd you've got a um cancer navigator and you've got someone helping you with we're reaching the community but also at any one time you're going to be dealing with the radiologist John colleges and you're a general surgeon you're going to have three primary dream physicians and\nFiguring out who's going to have you off from work and who's not and who's going to give you a medication and then you laugh at certain comes and there are a lot of physicians and so my point earlier it wasn't that they didn't necessarily care they're quite that care quite a bit but your sense of urgency about the you know I'm going to die tomorrow and them knowing you're not going to die tomorrow\nEverything's going to be okay this is a part of the process I think um that's where having the region having support helps you get to navigate that\nAs we could have support image of should of spouses of family members or friends can help a lot\nThey can actually have family members come with me they were there was like a little not a lot of like who's going to go into the Mona time because I'm going with me um but it's really I'm a really good thing in a tool to be able to speak and on top of your feelings on your motions it's no different than any other disease illness you doing it by yourself is difficult and having a support system in place is really helpful\nAnd even within my my medical facility to start they have an entire breast cancer support group where they meet they do painting um they have um they offer a massage as\nThey do a lot of things to help you deal with what's going on and they also have support from my husband and they have support groups for them as well so I think tapping into your facility um your medical providers and and also it's happening in the home and there's less resources you know you don't have to do it by yourself\nLet's talk about the race we sure are coming up here and just several days and a vision of the described for those who might be listening to don't really know what happens to show us whatever [noise]\nSo we meet and bell ballpark um bright and early it's daylight savings time so you have no excuse to not come out and know it sounds early but you've got already an extra hour [noise]\nUm we have about ten thousand people that join us we have um an expo area where um we have you know vendors and corporate sponsors and then we do an opening ceremonies\nAnd where will you'll get to hear from ... and here a little bit more about the services that Komen offers\nUm and we also have a survivor parade which is incredibly powerful and moving to see all these survivors from you know people holding signs um last year I remember looking out into the crowd and there was somebody holding a sign that said zero months standing next to somebody that said forty years\nAnd that to me was why why we're there [noise]\nUm so it's a it's a really great morning and um you can either do the one mile or the five K.\nAt five K. actually walks on um the one sixty three three closed down the highway which is pretty cool you don't often get a chance to do that it's a mobile park so it's beautiful and and we have I'm a survivor village where we pamper are survivors\nThey have um flowers and music and that sort of a pink carpet that you can walk can breath tests and so that's a really great experience\nUm and we have our little pop up boutiques and if you need some wear pink ribbon coming here we have that\nYou can bring your dogs as the pups figure we have food track just you know a lot of really great things in life entertainment all along the route and in this year and lifted offering twenty five percent off of your\nUm ride to and from the race\nAnd how many people take part in the walk again about ten thousand people and what time again does it start on November fourth and are there in person or\nBoth we would love if you register ahead of time and and then tell your friends and family that you're doing this and see if they want to support you and they may want to help you I hit a fundraising transit family that you're doing this and see if they want to support you and they may want to help you I hit a fundraising target\nAnd that wiped out as they say about sixty five billion dollars and so now we see Amazon a ... is the third most valuable company and we have a um a Microsoft in the number two position\nWhile it's a it's an amazing how quickly things can can change a in stock market value on friday a let's see\nI Want to look at ... I'm trying to get the number for Microsoft here and it's not coming up but it's around I I I think yeah\nA Microsoft eight hundred and twenty three billion dollars a and that puts a slightly ahead\nOf a Amazon dot com but but certainly apple continues to be the the big dog holding holding onto a value above above one trillion dollars so so I guess the question I Want to ask right now and will open up our phone lines to let you\nComment on this I really would appreciate your participation\nUm [noise] what have you done\nHas this drop in the market during this month of October which is kind of a normal thing and by the way we are still\nA I think the NASDAQ may be right at correction mode which would be a ten percent declined from your from its most recent high\nAh but the the Dow in the S. and P. five hundred or not they're they're close a but they are ... are still less than down a ten percent\nHas this has this caused you to change your investment strategy\nAre you now saying OK\nIt's time to get out before it drops twenty percent let's get out and uh we'll wait for the right time to get back in I Love I Love to hear people say that because\nHow do you know when the right time is to get back in but I Want I really really really want to hear from people who have made the decision that because of the volatility they're going to step aside\nThey're just going to move over a out of the fast lane they're going to move over to the little bit further to the to the right and uh and when the time comes go get back in ... I really would love to hear from you folks that have made that commitment rather\nThan saying okay we're going to write this baby out we learned our lesson in two thousand eight two thousand nine and a lot of people who got out and then when the market fell more than fifty percent\nUh probably I've never gotten back into the market so if you have gotten out of the market I I I'm not making fun of you I totally understand your fear of a of the market going down substantially more\nBut if you have tell me why please tell me why and more importantly than that tell me when you're going to get back in when will you know what what what will be that that message that you'll get\nThat says it's time to get back yet is it twenty percent is it thirty percent is it forty percent is it fifty percent are in decline when will you get back into the market gave me a call ... eight hundred six hundred five six for six\nThat's eight hundred six hundred five six for six I really need to hear from you today on this stuff or or or give me a call on our metro line eight five eight area code five six nine eight to five five it really\nReally is it would make for a great discussion I think it really would make for a great discussion so again if you want to give a call and now we've got two hours here we have plenty of time to fill up we've got some some folks will be talking to\nA but give me a call ... eight hundred six hundred five six four six eight hundred six hundred five six for six or the metro area you can give me a call the the lines are available to you right now\nAt eight five eight five nine seven Nineteen eighty I got a ton of stuff to talk about today but more importantly than what I have to say is what you all have to say\nAnd so well let's kick that around okay I Will take a break here will come back a lot more coming up as we go with your 'til two o'clock today right here on news radio six hundred cocoa\nSending all kinds of credit union traffic senators report is sponsored by your cynical hunger dealers alright declared that accident he stayed at college got a new fender bender those self at of honor governor Dr slowly ... ready for great deals and a great attitude\nNot to mention the hottest new models on the road when it comes to helping you on a new Honda you're sending on the news are ready to\nFind your nearest dealer does tea on his he goes dot com ... new center real time updates twelve fifty\nA Thanks John George Chamberlain here for San Diego habitat for humanity I'm sure most of you are familiar with habitat for humanity an organization that helps people have a safe healthy place to put their head down at night for their families to be safe and secure\nSan Diego habitat for humanity searched families obviously right here in our own backyard and all the nations that are receives state locally homeownership helps families become stable children do better in school and parents do better at work it's a great organization\nAnd one way that you can help out significantly it's become a customer at San Diego a habitat for humanity reef stores these are for basically ah what you would call them home improvement centers\nThat have been set up and have an amazing variety of products for sale right there at thirty to Seventy percent off retail you're going to find things like uh all kinds of things like furniture carpeting\nPaint are so many things and one of the neat things about going into their stores in San Diego Kearney Mesa area asking NATO national city and now they're new a store in Carlsbad it's right off the highway Seventy eight at Jefferson street right it's\nYou have to sit there all of the proceeds support habitat for humanity mission of building and repairing homes for local families in need of improved housing find out more online by going to San Diego habitat dot O.

with us on the program I'd uh joining me on the show right now I always it just seems like we haven't talked for a while but ah we probably have\nJoined me on the program right now is Aubrey Morrow of course you are listening to his program every Saturday morning at eight o'clock right here on pogo and the heads up a financial designs limited here in San Diego helping families and businesses be successful with their planning process good afternoon Aubrey\nThis German Lynn\nGood to talk with you again my my friend ... have you with us\nI I I I Want to talk to where the real quick here about a couple of things uh ... let's talk about the the stock market first of all but more important I I I always like to get for new cars you and I think are are\nKindred spirits on a lot of things I think our approach to investing and things is relatively similar here so therefore I Would assume that's pretty much what you are a spouse to your your clients as well um\n[noise] how are they reacting to what's been going on during the school Fremont\nActually with a response from climb stored\nThat's what I knew you were going to say [laughter] that was that's a credit to get\nYou have to get trained and understand you have to be kept ordinarily will diversified [noise] um I think when you're gambling when you have a handful of stock all due respect to stockbrokers I think if you have this talk that stuck and it really an investor you're more of a gambler and secular Vegas sometimes\nYou can win but most likely you're not going to win but we've had\nYou know are you for you last ten years so I'm stocks looking really well and they were people will juggling the bandwagon\nAnd you have to think of stocks and I know as long term investor and one of the ways to not rock the boat has to be extraordinarily well diversified including real estate so we're we're already well diversified us international emerging markets and then we add all those are real estate to level thing though\n[noise] you know where did all of what I always get you and I I I I Do this probably every every Sunday on the show I always point out OK okay we we've gone through a rough patch and you're All right that's fine and you got out of the market congratulations you are smart enough to do that\nWhere you tell me when you're going to get back in 'cause I sure would like to know all those stock market timers out there that are getting out I mean we've learned our lesson over and over and over again they're trying to time the market is an extremely dangerous thing to do\nYou know Georgia it's two emotions that causes to make any kind of decisions with regard to stocks and bonds you and I know this old hat it's fear and greed and literally the last ten years thereabouts we put a market that goes up and down and up and down but just dramatically going up\nAnd it'll probably continue going up as do we pick through this season you know typically people have fear they get out of the market not kidding they've said that for many many years\nI remember watching TV with my uh which is now thirty five year old daughter which was probably by the right thing that what's happening on the stock market dropping ... what does that mean that people are afraid or selling they're getting out of the market and she said what does it mean to me they're selling them and they they're selling she's all well and people are selling who's buying\n[laughter]\nThat's the question that exactly right that's a great way to put a great way to put it for sure uh you mentioned real estate a moment ago let's talk about real estate in a couple of different ways first of all people say Aubrey you say to diversify into real estate how do you do that so I'll let you explain how I got to do that\nWell clearly Georgia's not too many ways you can be successful financially or certainly one people typically on the east coast have made a lot of money millions of dollars in the stock market typically on the west coast of millions of dollars in the late in the real estate market and some people are out and start a business of some people get an inheritance\nClearly everything goes in cycles has you have ... people for probably forty years on the radio\nA and it's it's ... you go crazy with that kind of stuff there is no hocus pocus as far as as TCU is concerned\nEvery point every dollar that you spend gets you two points and then you can use those points when you are when you went to\nA and take advantage of things I travel you can travel internationally are there are many kinds of things you can

I'm Eighteen thousand nine hundred dollars for a home on elm street fifty seven thousand for the the median city a median value for all homes and Hogan ville [noise]\nImagine that those dollar amounts [noise]\nWow [noise] so anyway just a little a little Halloween related stuff here and it ... on on a real estate how much\nIt didn't even look like what was called ...\nIm are now as the see the stadium every thing was navy navy shirt took over the stadium inside all the signage you never would have known that you were playing in LA where the aspects or the chargers used to play\nYeah I that's funny I did get home to catch like the last quarter\nAnd so I did I did notice that I'm saying is is this really is and I'm looking at the right thing here what's going on so but that's very cool I I think it's a marvelous thing we were very ... and ... and for CBS to put it on their network oh yeah a show that's that says a lot right\nThere well they knew it was going to sell out I I think the ... the series with I think navies one like something like six games in the series since they've played last time they one was like two thousand twelve but uh you know a Notre Dame they play all of the military schools will play Airforce\nNATO and army they play them every year and then of course yeah horse Army Navy they all play each other for the commanders trophy so I'm great to have it he really really great to have it here\nA ... that that's that's really really cool I've ... I think you and I even talked about this Phil ... I I don't I don't like the term bucket list but if there is one football game I Would love to see in my lifetime limits Army Navy in Philly\nArmy Navy and you know I mean the cadets the Mideast Paco nuts you know after a touchdown and ... you know the ... you know that all started you know I think they do it at Texas A M now but that all started with that rivalry\nYou scored a touchdown you do six points to score the extra point seven points and you do pushups and you know when that gets the game gets up to forty some you know one today that guy is done like two hundred pushups if you know basically forty something point a lot of push ups man with a lot\nOf Bush a lot of pressure hey one other thing I Want to while we're on football um if you're watching I think the game's over now but if uh the Seahawks we're playing a today and they\nThey'd be whoever they were ... pretty handily Detroit yeah um this was on their uniforms today and for I don't know how long are they have a patch now to honor their former owner Paul Allen who passed away yeah this month\nA from a has a battle with a lymphoma\nAnd it you know when you look at the patch fail it's kind of weird it's got his initials ... PGA and then it's got like a little it looks like a\nA little flag on a on a on a train and I I ... that you would see on ... and it has the number of twelve on it and I'm going what says well they're honoring him as the twelfth man twelve man yeah yeah but it it was kind of when when you look at and you see you go why are they honoring the PGA\nAnd then you figure out oh it's Paul Allen and a and a guy that that own not only are the\nSea hawks but the Portland TrailBlazers and and uh and other stuff like that so I I I thought that was a rather nice gesture on their part\nI noticed pretty cool and and you know a couple of things have happened this this week in a pertaining to cancer obviously it's\nA national breast cancer awareness month however right however we kind of you know celebrate commemorate this month or two include all cancers and if you watch the baseball game last night\nUm MasterCard along with major league baseball and Fox did something and I know you've seen this before called stand up to cancer the entire is the entire Dodger Stadium each and every one\nHad a placard which won or either their mother their brothers their son or daughter and her husband\nEven the players and I so so I I I took a shot I took screen softer this last night and I put it on my Facebook and I said what a cool idea they've done this before but\nI don't remember the players being involved and I said what a great idea by MasterCard and ... will be hooking up together and I said because everybody knows someone who has cancer or know someone who knows someone who has cancer MasterCard donates\nFour million dollars last night not only for research but also for equipment and care\nAnd the last thing I wanted to get to you if if if we if we have like a minute\nAh oh okay you know it's been crazy this weekend with the stock market so what I did was I went around the building\nEarlier today and I talked to some of the uh the younger people at some of the FM stations and they have questions for you here we go\nAnd join a I'm a cane I'm ... I'm In college how new I ... start saving for my future\nThat's a deep question at Eighteen and going to college very\nGood one very good one it's it's very simple you do it or if you can at all do it this way do it this way go if you're if you're able to participate in a four O. one K. or retirement plan where you work\nEspecially if your employer is willing to match your contribution and and realizing that at Eighteen this is a long term commitment it's better to do it this way than any other way that's the best way to start the other way is just\nJust start putting money away and uh and uh and uh you know you'll you'll get to a point where you're going to turn into an ... an investor that's where I ultimately would tell somebody be to do is if you've got to become an investor and there's ways to do that\nOkay we got one other one here and this is from a guy who was thirty one and a and you can tell this is from the hip hop station just by the way it starts\nIn DC so I'm In between ... and a ... baby and I have you know about ten thousand dollar seem to have a four O. one K. and worked my butt off I just want to know like at the NATO crazy stock incident what should I Do a\nGood question sit back yeah good question it back forget about it he says he did not look this week and that's a good thing right right\n[noise] yeah well I mean it's okay to avoid it don't don't don't don't have an emotional reaction to what you see okay so what what I think you need to do is exactly what he's doing he's thirty one years old he's already saved up ten thousand dollars in in the in the four one K. got some matching dollars I'm sure on that\nAnd uh keep doing it keep doing it and leave it alone just forget about oh by the way it's one thing to put money into a four O. one K. and stuff like that\nBut you've got to make that money work for you so you can't just put it in there and have it in an interest bearing accounts you know put it in the U.S and the five hundred index fund and forget about it forget about it put it in doing\nThat and and every four O. one K. has an S. and P. five hundred index but that's where it\nShould be so that's what we got that's what the two two questions from uh some of the younger people around here and you know hopefully the moms and dads out there listening as well and ah can get their ... can get their ah kids started as well hey I tell you what let's do this every once in a while if you don't mind\nDo hey I thought I didn't know you a curve you throw me these her sometimes we just roll with the punches buddy and any ... any ... any called you gee see did you see see see see\nOrdinarily ...

I'm sure there are people out there that have a a a a method a plan to do that but most of the people I Know that I've bought investment real estate\nHave been had been really successful in getting the income they want off of that when the housing market fell apart and those seven or eight or nine I Know a lot of people who went into the central part of the United states a central part of California\nUh Fresno stocked in that area there which really got clobbered there were so many bad loans made other you want to get mad at somebody\nYou want to get mad at somebody about the the real estate market\nGet mad at the people who are making those loans get mad at Alan Greenspan\nGet mad at Bill Clinton get mad at people like that that said everybody that wants to own a home should own a home and they they they put so much pressure on lenders\nIf somebody came in the door and said oh we want to buy a house and they say okay that's that's fine I'm a\n... a it's a house over there for six hundred thousand dollars we want to buy that house over there [noise]\nOkay um can you just sign this document for us and we'll give you a check for that amount ... back then what what Greenspan and and and I ... got Bill Clinton I I don't get mad at me for saying that it's just it's a fact okay [noise]\nUm they said\nWe're not going to make people have to qualify for loans if they want to buy a house will give him the money to buy the damn house okay and so what we wound up with a situation\nWhere people that didn't have to end and they and oh and by the way on top of all that you don't have to put any money down\nJust if it's a six hundred thousand dollar house\nHere's a loan for six hundred thousand dollars we don't need any proof that you're you're you've got any income we don't need any proof that you're going to be able to pay the mortgage and that you're going to be able to repay the loan and so what happened is was people were going out and buying all of these houses are ...\nAnd then all of a sudden boom the market fell apart\nOkay a\nAs a result of that we wound up with a lot of people walking away from their loans I mean just walking away it wasn't at all like we are right now back then there was housing available everywhere and people were buying houses\nAre now there is no inventory of housing of any merit and so\nThat's what led to the housing crash back in ... seven o seven or eight and ... it was it was just this ridiculous lending\nBenge that we went on okay so now we're back into a situation and so people were going into San jose in and do stocked and uh uh Fresno places like that and buying up homes and the people obviously that all those homes all of a sudden we're now turned into renders\nAnd these people were buying homes for\nA\nTen cents on the dollar and they were able to buy them for cash turn them around and sell them\nOur our ... our rent them I'm I'm Sorry I'm kinda doing going in a lot of directions here and I'm going to end this thing and uh and so they were able to rent them have positive cash flow on an investment that was ideal\nAnd maybe now they're going to be looking at a situation where it's time to get out so who knows what ... effect that will have\nOn things as as time goes by but rent control is\nIs fine in some places and others it's not so fine so we'll see what happens just want to finish my discussion about what we are going to be doing this week is we're going to be busy busy with economic news Wednesday we start getting into jobs reports ... employment report comes out\nThat's one that measures ah employment in the private sector what kind of payroll increases did we see Thursday we get the weekly jobless claims\nAnd we also get a report on construction spending and then on friday we get the official\nA government report on a on a um employment on payrolls and so it's going to be a busy busy week every day has some very important economic news coming out on that will be paying attention to so", "show_name": "George Chamberlin (Money Matters)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "28"}
