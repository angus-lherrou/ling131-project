{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "So there's there's multiple challenges and being in the reserves a balancing it with your family life balancing it with your civilian work\nBouncing it with your children like it's it's\nI Would not say it's easy at all\nBut a hopeless all worth it\nRight definitely so through the reserves I have been able to you know get my education paid for I've been able to you know reap the benefits of the G. I. bill tuition assistance um I wouldn't be here working at courage to call today if it weren't with uh all the support that I've had in the military\nDo me a both and encouraged to call up became the name for this\nYet so courage to call actually started in two thousand nine and so that predates both Christina and I buy it kinda goes it stems from like having that courage to make that call because there is such a stigma even still today like we said earlier with asking for that\nHelp and so like courage to call the thing that they can do is it can be as simple as hey I just need this resource to all the way to how do I use my GI Bill to I Need some intense\nHelp with my ... stress and everything in between so courage to call is really just that having the courage to call and speak to another fellow veteran has the line is operated on the whole team is either a veteran or spouses\nAnd so having the courage to call somebody and reach out and get\nThe help that you need there what is the number to call\nSo you can go to our website which is courage to called dot org the number two and Christina has the phone number\nThe phone number is one eight seven seven six nine eight seven eight three eight that's a toll free number and you can also call to one one option for\n... review that are from Asia before the closer the program you mentioned a Christian in a moment ago about the cubes and and the the children of separation that occurs ... that occurs are there are programs that help children as well through through the eyes would definitely\nSo when we meet a for different coalition meetings there's programs there's grants out there that help children be involved in sports there's there's programs that help kids go to a summer camps\nThey can do these things but you know it's just being aware of the resources that are there so if we have any military families that are they're really\nStruggling with their children like that's been gone mom is stressed as on deployment mom doesn't know who to turn to because mom isn't a new place and doesn't really have a support network get\nAnd the kids are really upset they're acting out there's definitely other children that are feeling the same way that we can connect those children to other children us through programs um that that really pay for it\nAnd alleviate a lot of the stress and provide some therapeutic environments for the children and that's what we want to do we want to link families with the resources that are really going to benefit\nThem Scrooge when you watch on television the returns from deployments you know when the ... of a man or woman gets off the ship and there's all destroyed\nAnd then I ... at a time when they go back home and they have to go to get back into life over again there are those moments that are not maybe is pleasant as we do families like that but they feel they can they become isolated easily\nAbsolutely yeah absolutely um I also as 'cause see I thought I was also do a military for many years\nSo my husband was on active duty I'm at the same time I was\nAnd coming home and it it's easy to just get into your world your bubble of taking care of yourself and to isolate and and nobody else understands I'm what you do when we even as veterans tend to do that we tend to hoard up and get together as veterans and\nBecause we're the only ones that are going to understand what we're going through and so it's really important to break through that both for our families and for the veterans and tried to get out there and read um integrate into the entire says\nNo you guys for ... for veterans to get together for ... and move spouses men and women of\nAbsolutely and one of the things that Christina was highlighting is that's amazing about courage to call is because there's so many resources specific to families specific to the veteran or active duty service member instead of trying to call Fifteen different places they can call one place and we can do a basic screening and tell you what would be appropriate\nFor you instead of you having to call\nOh no I'm not eligible for that when I'm not eligible for that when they can literally call in to us to our line and they can speak with a fellow veterans that is going to be able to say hey no you know what you're eligible this is the best fit for your situation because\nOn as we said earlier every veteran's experience every military family is it a different experience though I was Navy I was attached to army unit so my experience is not the same\nAs Christine us but mine is also not the same as a fellow sailors so every experience is different and it's important that if they call in and we can help them find what is appropriate for them in their family\nReal people listening to you guys right now must feel very encouraged by what you're saying is worthy\nAnd get some help and how can people help I mean you mentioned volunteers and the organization and I would imagine that a donations to the organization helps as well how can people do that\nSo so there's multiple ways they can donate to for clothing through the on lifting that we had that operation dress code that Khan but also if they go to encourage the number to call dot org and they can go in there because the reality is is this is all free to our service members\nAnd so we take donations monetary donation says well so if they maybe can't come out and volunteer maybe they've been out of this business world for a while and they don't have closed it down and we need hangers we need other things that we buy for that day the rat\nThings like that that all costs money so maybe volunteering ours isn't work for them that they have the option that's also donating monetary early on our website\nSo there is a way for people to hell yes well we'll have a ... minute or so left here but I wanted to make sure that we get to get information out to about how to contact you just said the the the website and that phone number I Want to give out the what's the phone number again for people to call it when they have the courage to call was the number again Christina\nIt's one eight seven seven six nine eight seven eight three eight\nOr you can contact to unwind and select option for\nUs to one one option for the numbers are used for a lot of different services that are Cuba today and it's a good one to remember to one one option number four before we go just to give you a final uh a few seconds here just to make sure what message you want people to have today ready\nYeah I I just ask you come out support our female veterans and active duty service members as they transition on in whatever way that means freedom just come out in support our fellow female veterans\n... worried about rising interest rates for a long long time I mean a very long time years three four five six seven years\nAnd uh and how scary and difficult it or it has been\nAnd in reality interest rates have not gone up that much you take a look at the ten year treasury note and that's the bell weather ah you'll see that the the the yield on the ten year treasury is right now about three point one three point two percent it had been in the height to ... percent range\nOr four years and years and years and so\nYou know in my way of thinking if we'd seen higher interest rates are we'd be looking at a five or six percent ten year no which even historically is not all that bad one of the headlines that came up in the past week\nWas a from a market watch which is owned by the wall Street Journal and it says mortgage rates so or as bond markets sell off catches up to housing market so let's go with the first three words their market are either mortgage rates store\nWhat does that mean it means that the average rate on a thirty year fixed rate loan\nWent from four point seven one percent a four point nine percent\nThat's hardly a measurable increase it's if you break it down on let's say you had a two hundred thousand dollar mortgage you run on today now to a two hundred thousand dollar mortgage you put down\nA you know a hundred thousand dollars on a nice two bedroom condo and alcohol and are asking detail and you've got it for three hundred thousand dollars and you put down a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd a and you got a new mortgage at four point nine percent okay using that average from Freddie Mac or your monthly payment would be at thirty seven dollars from where I Would have been a year ago\nBecame a and a for a whole year would be\nA four point four percent are either four hundred and forty four dollars more than a ... a year ago at a ... with a different interest rates now what's what's really interesting about that for me and in some ways is the the fact of the matter that if\nIf that four hundred and forty dollars a year\nIs a deal breaker for you on getting a loan versus staying a renter and watching your rent go up by more than that every year\nThen you shouldn't have bought a house okay if they've that that's Thirteen dollars a I'm a ... a month was too much or thirty seven dollars a month I think it was\nIt's too much for you then you shouldn't even be looking to buy a home\nOr by the way it interestingly enough that that is almost exactly identical to what we were told by Social Security this past week\nThat people receiving Social Security benefits on average will be getting an increase of about thirty seven dollars a month in their in their benefits that the biggest increase we've seen I think since two thousand eleven or maybe even further back than uh than that so\nYou know it's it's it's it's a media saying it's a media thing to to put out reports that say mortgage rate soar\nWhen they really didn't saw they just went up a little bit but it's enough to kind of try to scare people and if you can scare people out of buying a house or investing in the stock market than you've done your job as a member of the media you try to dissuade people from improving their lives and are doing a good job\nI let's take a break here I'm really having a hard time today so we'll see if we can make it through this thing uh we'll give you a phone numbers to call if you want to call in and join me on the program a they're a toll free for all of Southern California eight hundred six hundred five six four six eight hundred

O. D. stands for some institutions call at AT T O D which is a transfer on debt\nBut it avoids probate whereas if you just have a will uh it was still have to be probate it even if you're designate someone as the beneficiary so going with a payable on death or transfer on death is an extremely smart thing to do that get your assets\nTo go where you want them to go as fast as you possibly can you can also accomplish that were the trust but here's a much easier way to do it using a P. O. D. or T. O. D. and uh and I I I'm Glad you brought that up because that's a really really smart decision and it probably gives you some peace of mind right\nWell I don't have the time because I'm constantly working on line [laughter] and you\nWrite health I listen to you every morning or some time mess that as much as I can I get a statement to make about was happening and count on\nAnd put on a different thing I Want to do because like if I hear several things about some come to think oh well that sounds good and I never liked K. that are making big money I always find a vast\nGood with Sandy it'd be pretty good times and bad times they carry through\nEverybody should have that plan everybody you don't you know if you if you are swing and for the fences all the time you're going to strike out a lot and I\nStarted investing that first stock I thought it in my early twenties [laughter]\nOh good for you good for you know that's when you've been a ... you you you gave me a chance to just talk about something very important that could help a lot of people as you by the way if you if you just heard me talking about the P. O. D. N. T. O. D. or go into your bank your credit union your mutual fund company and say\nI Want to have this designation put on my account remember you you control the asset until you die and uh and then it it doesn't have to go through the courts or anything like that it's a smart way to do it and if we help one or two people in here chard than we've done the right thing thanks so much for your call appreciate it okay\nThank you bye\nOkay Bye bye or let's go to a Cyprus and talk with Bill Hi Bill welcome to the program\nI enjoy your program thanks so my question is I ever trust established for quite some time and I have a traditional higher rate and my question is should I put that traditional i._r._a. into the trust and should or should I not and why\nWell you can't per se put the trust into the into the uh the IRA into the trust you\nCan name that you could name you could name the trust as the beneficiary of your ah IRA and then they would\n... the the the money would go to a to the trust and then it could be distributed as you wanted a distributed um how do you do have a large number of beneficiaries that your IRA would go to\nA four or for beneficiaries\nAre they aware of this and and would they be comfortable if you left it in the in the IRA\nAh yeah yeah\nYeah see I'm\nI'm not so sure that there wouldn't be some tax where you're going to have tax consequences when you distribute assets out of an IRA anyway because they're in the tax deferred account and that means that somewhere along the line Uncle Sam ... going to get his money from you work\nWell let me let me add something I've also have a beneficiary IRA when my mom passed away and so when I received her money I uh I have to take so much out per year and I'm a tax on it right\n[noise] so I don't know if it's the same thing with the um with this irate that I'm Talking about for myself like in other words if I put her in a trust is there at a good thing or is that a bad thing if I leave it where it is I I'm up in the air\nIt's six to one half dozen of another uh in all honesty bill because as I say somewhere somehow Uncle Sam is going to get his money [laughter]\nI realized I was thinking maybe the for beneficiaries would have to pay tax on the amount they receive my thinking but I don't know if that's true\nOh sure it is true yeah\nYou know if it if it has to be paid all at one time or is it spread out over five years\nOn an inherited IRA you do get a a a ... a number of options I'm not up to speed on all of them but you have a number of options as to how you want to pay the taxes that are due\nOkay because I I also was an inherited a I inherited 'em an annuity and they gave me five years to pay it which was such a good idea because I took it all at the fifth year so that really uh increase my um my you high tech civil Lincoln for that year one\nOf the many reasons I don't like a new ... yes they uh they they are that you you're you're gonna wind up giving away forty percent of whatever the value\nWell he didn't know this is my mom so [laughter] [laughter] I understand no tree oh okay you're bad thanks for the call appreciate it ... yeah you gotta be\nCareful about all this stuff folks there's just you know attacks differ oh it was a study done years ago a by University in California\nAnd it was titled the cruel hoax of tax referral taxed or for all just means you're going to get more money to the government than what you saw it on the surface it sounds like a good idea but it's not it's not\nOur we're going to take a break your will come back with more as we
