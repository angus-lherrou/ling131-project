Lopez Cooper the executive director of the family justice centers are both of you welcome are being here today thank you good morning you know sort of port in the issue that we face in our humidity all across the country but here in San Diego\nOr being the best of violence month so Mars city attorney obviously you know you you see these things happening or\nYou're in the the business of handling of certain kinds of prosecution and that kind of thing but could you give our listeners kind of an overview of your impression of just how serious this to ...\nI I think it's very serious here in San Diego our office to San Diego city attorney's office prosecutes about a thousand of these cases every year\nWe have a very high conviction rate so these are cases that we can prove I think what concerns me the most is that's what we're aware of but domestic violence is still an issue that people are very reluctant to talk about\nAnd the purpose of focusing on domestic violence during October is to encourage people to come and reach out to the services that are low locally available to them\nAnd also to get a conversation going because these things are happening in our own families at our schools at our place of employment\nAnd a lot of people don't want to talk about it is deeply deeply personal so I Want people to come out of the shadows and reach out to the San Diego city attorney's office or a family Justice Center and get help and get the resources that that that they need to become survivors and get back up on their feet\nYou bet as the executive director of the family Justice Center obviously you work intimately with people who are victims are family and and others involved in this is this problem and and this issue what is it can you describe what is it that causes a lot of victims of domestic violence as as Mara we just saying\nTo not want to talk about hesitant to say anything about it and ... and sometimes as an obviously to report it\nYes you know and as you mentioned at the beginning of the interview you know domestic violence has no boundaries it affects men equally as women um it affects a straight relationships the algae beauty community\nUm at the family Justice Center we see clients that are as young as Nineteen years old and even into their seventies and what we see is that like the city attorney mark Elliott hadn't mentioned is it it's a very personal issue\nYou know domestic violence as complicated\nThis relationship is like no other you know where there's control where there's isolation where there's threat where someone is actually dictating to another person what kind of make up they can wear who can be their friends\nWhat clothes are they going to wear and it escalates\nSo it's it's very complicated I'm at the family Justice Center what we're trying to do is to transition victims into survivors to really provide a safe space for someone to come to receive resources and to feel that they're going to be protected but most importantly what we're really trying to do is offer hope\nIf someone's listening right now who is a victim of domestic violence knows of somebody who is more concerned about somebody that they know can they contract you directly the family just to sort of directly in when they do what happens\nTo someone can contact us they can walk in were open Monday to friday eight to five o'clock six one nine five three three six thousand is our phone number\nAnd they come in and we will immediately connect them with the domestic violence advocate we will give me an assessment 'em and see what their situation is like and what we're really trying to do is to listen to our clients we understand that every situation is different every family is different\nI'm Still the services can be different you know there's not a a one size fits all to this problem\nUh we are a team of dedicated professionals that the family Justice Center we have\nPsychologists social workers nurses\nUm we work very closely with the police department a with a domestic violence unit\nOr a team of attorneys and so we really look at the problem and look at what are the needs that this person really needs at this moment and how can we help them but at the same time always letting 'em that person take the lead I'm On what type of services that they\nThat they require and if I could just add to that um we're conveniently located downtown we're right next to a trolley stop there as parking underneath our building so I Know that there's often concerns about going downtown with um the inability to find parking says the location is one one to two broad way\nAnd if somebody is unable to get down as um as a vet just mentioned they can call or eight six six number in addition to the local number it's eight six six nine three three hope they can also visit San Diego dot Gov slash F J. C. so there are many ways to reach us\nAnd that way if somebody is listening right now they can get information even before they call you or were were report what's happening and when they walk in their concern is going to be ... I assume when they call to they're going to be afraid\nThey're going to be afraid of who knows and and whether they'll be discovered so to speak or whatever how do you handle\nThat so I guess I can start with that there are there's lots of concerns I think when you initially reach out for help um some people don't speak English we have interpreters were available to assist them\nSome folks are concerned because as we discussed it's deeply personal and they want their privacy respected this is a private place and we bend over backwards to make sure that people feel that and they know they can talk to us and they can trust us with this very sensitive information\nThere are some folks who are not documented\nAnd the family Justice Center is available to everybody we do not check paper so I Want the community to know that a victim as a victim to us and we care and we're going to be right there for them and we are not looking at immigration status of there\nOften concerned about what they're going to do with their children a lot of folks are running um they're coming down to us and they they've got very young children we are able to provide 'em supervision to children we have an area within the family Justice Center where the children are supervised ... while the parent\nOr receive the treatment and counseling and initial um assistance that they need so I feel like we've really looked at this problem from all angles so that we're welcoming and people come to us and we're going to make sure that when they come they can focus on the issues and won't be there for them\nAs city attorney question that I had for you if a woman is in a situation where let's say it's been happening and [noise]\nAnd um you bet you said that it tends to escalate um if it continues if there if something is not happening at the moment that you would call police obviously are nine one one should the call police just to say if they're concerned about being followed\nWhat what would you advise in those situations where it may not be an emergency but it's a serious situation nor afraid that when he gets home let's say something's gonna happen mhm\n[noise] right well if you know if anybody feels that their life is in danger they should definitely seek out the police department um you know and called nine one one um [noise]\nWe safety is paramount at the family Justice Center\nA privacy is very important you know sixty percent of the cases that we see come to us for a temporary restraining order so these are individuals who fear that their life is in danger\nOr we have a group of attorneys that are able to help them to file a temporary restraining order that day to protect them and protect them so yeah so so working closely also with the family law system with the family legal system\n[noise] you know this problem as you said earlier goes from teenagers to very senior people obviously you see all ages and all kinds of people who are victims of this\nUh when it comes to relationships and when this begins are there signs in younger people's first relationships or when they're considering being with somebody for a period of time are there things to look for that you could advise people about [noise] you don't have you\nOn that probably sees it from the ground I'm more than I Do I hear more about it when I'm Out in the community I'm visiting and the city of San Diego\nBut I I think that um even in a young relationship there's a couple of things you can say you've got victims who've grown up around domestic violence and that's all they've ever known that is what they believe to be in a normal way of living of expressing their emotions and their love for somebody else", "show_name": "The Community Connection", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "08"}
