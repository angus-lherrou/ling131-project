{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "You're listening to the community connection\nWith Albert next Sunday thousands of people are going to be gathering at ... park to bring attention to the fight to end breast cancer it as the Susan G Komen race for the cure coming up next Sunday\nSusan Komen raises money for research to provide services to help educate people about the disease\nWhich takes the lives of thousands of people each year in the United states you could be part of finding a cure for breast cancer rid of talk more about that today with our two guests joining us on the community connection our sugar grows president and CEO of the Susan G ... organization\nAnd ... grade the two thousand Eighteen Susan Komen said he'd go race for the cure honorary survivor welcome to both of you for being here thanks for having it's just such an important topic and it uh it it affects so many people in our humidity of families and friends of those who are diagnosed with breast cancer\nOr should tell us first just the about the Susan G common for people who are probably familiar with the name but no really know much about the organization itself give us a little thumbnail sketch\nSure so I'm very proud to say that the majority of the work that we do is local here in San Diego county and I think that's kind of what sets us apart and people know this isn't just common brand it's very big everybody sees pink in October\nBut not very many people know what we do a behind the pink ribbons and so Komen provide services for a low and middle income uninsured under insured women making sure that they get their mammograms biopsies ultrasounds MRI's any of the things they need to get an accurate diagnosis\nAnd then once diagnosed we will also pay for all of those things\nThat you need in order to complete treatment that maybe your insurance doesn't cover um transportation to back and forth to medical appointments\nI rented mortgage when you're out of work because you're in treatment meals delivery and help with lymphedema sleeves waves all of those sorts of things and so his ... his very proud to step in and support local San Diego ends and then I Am twenty five percent of the money that we raise goes toward research and that's to finding\nThe cure or the next breakthrough in treatment and all of the things that as you referenced that we really hope that we see some time soon\nBut a lot more services and probably who are not involved ... had access to those services probably do the do realize not only just financial support but just the general support that it off\nAbsolutely the emotional support as well um help with um help navigating the medical system it can be very complicated and overwhelming when you're trying to figure out a medical speak and witch doctor I go to for this and that and so we do that we do care coordination\nWe do a lot of outreach into the community we have mobile mammogram events throughout the county all year round\nAnd the race for the cure is our biggest fundraiser of the year that allows us to provide all of those services\nSo we're going to give our listeners lots of opportunity to learn more about the race for the cure and how they can get a ball but first we want to introduce you to Lilian who is this yours isn't ... for the cure auditory survivor so lonely and tell us told us a little bit about your story of how your involved now as the modern survivor\n[noise] I was diagnosed with uh say three breast cancer in last July and when it happened I didn't have much exposure to breast cancer while I was in my family I didn't really understand the extent of what was going on\nAnd I didn't have it with anyone to turn to respect for getting information or just support or you know groups places where you can go on talking about what's happening\nTo hurt us as a Jew called me one I you know I Need the pink ribbon than I've seen those are all around and my husband actually\nCalled I'm coming in and they opened is up to a lot of resources and that's when we learned about the race and got involved with the race for pure and for me was really to when it hit home for the most is that I was able to find a lot of information on their website about you know was breast cancer what all of the resources where to go what to ask\nBut also when the actual race happened I was right in the heart of my the rest as part of my chemo and I was able to really draw for um strength from seeing all the survivors or it helped me tremendously being able to see women had to be had beaten the disease and to know that it wasn't going to take me\n[noise] what was the toughest things that looking back when you first diagnosed and there's a lot of tough times I'm sure a difficult times that you go through but uh what was the what's been the hardest thing for you\nActually have I've had three different heart things um I Would make them I'm the first one was we we first got diagnosed and I say we 'cause my husband and I sort of be considered as being a to join the net effect everyone in your family\nAnd when we were diagnosed we we didn't know really what the diagnosis was and how bad it was we didn't know that had gone to my left knows and they weren't sure if it's gone anywhere else in my brain my liver\nAnd initial scans they thought it might have been elsewhere and waiting for that and navigating the system because of physicians ten you know they've gone through it before and they they know most likely it's not this and it's not that you don't\nAnd and so your sense of urgency and their sense of urgency that always a line and it was about a month where I was waiting to find out and they're like oh we'll have examined two weeks it the way for authorizations and the ... I'm from your provider and\nForget that I'm paying for it I don't care what I Know now I don't I don't want that an hour with this\nThing and me I Want it out I went surgery now and and they were more you know you know that that month was really difficult not knowing and I know how bad it is and dealing with mortality and am I going to die and all things like that when you process that I'd never felt fear and I thought before and that\nWas really difficult um but what I Will say that everyone is afraid of people oftentimes don't want to hear bad news and so they won't go get tested I won't go to the information [noise]\nNot knowing I'm is bad but when you have a plan and being able to perform at your plan and do something about it is very empowering and I think you need to balance that out and say okay I I don't want to hear the bad news but let me get tested anyway maybe it's not going to be bad news and if this bad news I've got all these resources to help me\nSo there were two other my second one was um dream my treatment I'm having to adjust I was off for over a year and having to go through the adjustment and some of the treatments weren't necessarily the most pleasant thing in the world\nUm I had a complication that most people don't have to have an algae the pain meds I'm sort of hope you always made me sick and so the thing that was supposed to help me was the thing that was causing me a lot of problems I didn't lose weight though um [laughter]\nBut that was pretty uncomfortable but it wouldn't be something that a lot of people would have to deal with but I unfortunately had this out to the pain medication um so that didn't really bode well for me dream my bouts of pain and in the last piece which is now kind of what I've gone through is you have this fear coming back\nAnd I am now I I just I have a blog and I was just reading about that it's like the the fear of you know Rick ... and not knowing and for me that's why I fight so hard um I Can't put the tagline for myself I'm In sales\nAnd my tagline is and I fight today so that others don't have to fight tomorrow and for me I don't want anyone to have to go through when I went through and so I'm I'm scared and I want to make sure that we find a cure and this never happens anybody\nWell it's great to hear him and the way that you're obviously helping be a blessing to other women who might be in a similar situation like that and now a shame that you talked to a lot of women obviously we're in a situation like China or a a a bully and has been\nA what do you what do you find when when women first contact with Susan Komen organization\nWhat are their first questions what are the greatest concern um\nI think people are absolutely concerned with their mortality and as you know am I going to die from this disease um is it going to disfigure me what will this mean we'll have to get 'em effect me like I have to have doubled insect me\nUm and what will this need for my family my future and and so it's scary people are just scared 'em and want you know to have knowledge is power they want more information they want to know how can they take charge\nIt how do we develop a plan how you know as well and said that's really empowering and so\nThey want help in formulating that plan\nUm and the women that we our survey we have resources for the entire community um ... million reference to the the questions to ask your doctor and we have that for every stage you know I feel I'm One of the questions I should ask have been diagnosed with breast cancer what are the questions I should ask them having surgery what are the questions I should ask him\nI think that's a really important because sometimes you go into that doctor's office and you're just\nYou just want to hear yes or no and they give you all of this information and you go home and you think wait what did they say and what did I and so um you know having those tools we always encourage people to bring somebody with them to the appointment who is like you were assigned secretary who's writing down all the information\nAnd so that you can look back on that but people really just don't know how to navigate the process so when they called Coleman or many of the folks who call us don't have resources that we would just helped a woman who was driving from Campo a Ninety miles for her treatment multiple times a week\nAnd she said you know I just can't afford the gas anymore\nSo we were able to give her gas card so we we mapped out how many more treatments do you have how many miles is that let's take care of your gas for you\nKnow we had another woman who called she was a single mom and she was going to not have her surgery because she didn't know who would take care of her kids while she was having surgery and Komen paid for her sister to fly out to take care of her kids that's not the kind of thing you can you know putting a claim with your insurance company for\n'em but it was the difference between her getting the treatment that she needed and not and that's really where I think its citizens you come and his unique and able to really step in and support people\nWhat's ... I Hope to because through the years obviously the research that's been going on the reality of options and things that have occurred over the euro obviously every year I imagine there's more being learned about it a word or things stand occur Italy in the fight against brusque", "show_name": "The Community Connection", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "29"}
