{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "You're listening to the community connection I'm\nThomas the blonde and this is community connection there was a horrible crime that most Sandy against can likely recall two young boys went on a bike ride in the south bay on a beautiful march morning in Nineteen Ninety three\nThey never return there was a massive surge that ended days later when their bodies were found near the ... river it wouldn't be until eight years later and two thousand one that the killer was found it was through advances in DNA\nThat he was identified he was already in prison serving time for other crimes he was charged with the murders of Jonathan sellers and Charlie keeper and he was found guilty and sentenced to death he's currently on death row\nFrom the tragedy grew an effort to teach children about personal safety\nJonathan's mother and father started a foundation dedicated to their son and his best friend Charlie its goal is to educate kids about the dangers that exist in the world through a safety presentation using a story written by Jonathan's mother called always fly away\nMolina sellers joins us on community connection to share her story and tell us about the work of the foundation the website J. F. C. K. dot org J. F. C. K. dot org\nMolina you know thank you for being here\nThank you so much for having me I really appreciate\nThat and I'm from the south bay I remember Nineteen Ninety three I remember march of Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd I remember seeing you you know all over the news and today twenty five years later it's about child safety first before we started asking me questions I just want to ask you this how are you you know how are you today\nToday I continue to take it one day at a time and I'm focusing on\nThe good what we can do um to make it a positive thing I don't want my son in Charlie's murder to just be in vain and I don't want people to think of them and just cry and it's just negative there is a reason\nThat got allowed this to happen and so I feel that he has empowered me to go and help save other children\nDoes it by teaching them just a very simple in basic less than\nTwenty five years later you're still you know changing the world you know changing you know the way you know it is out there in teaching children how to be safe through that book which we will get you in a few seconds but can you tell me about Jonathan\nJonathan oh my goodness he was so beautiful Jonathan has the most beautiful eyes and actually the book one of the things that I had the artists draw the birds Stella I said I Want Jonathan's eyes and they're just these big beautiful happy full of life knives\nAnd those warm\nWonderful wet kisses that he would always given he was always laughing\nAnd he'd love to eat it was as bad that you love and some food and basketball right on average sport he was just Jonathan was a peacemaker just\nLoving 'em he knew the rules he always try to abide by the rules he was very very helpful sometimes as friends um parents would say a little too helpful [laughter] but he was just a happy young boy\nNow I'm telling about Charlie Charlie Cheever and his family houses mom doing\nMurray is doing okay she's been going through some health issues is has been very stressful um the the last twenty five years is that been easy um and the first\nTen years of course eight years not knowing who the killer was not knowing who could have done this do they live right next door I'm Maria was so fabulous she went undercover Maria was out there talking to people she was just ... ... she was extremely upset\nOf course like all of us but she was able to take that anger\nAnd do something you know she physically went out to the river bottom since she's talking to the homeless people and she wants to know if you've seen anything if you know this is my son did you see anybody with him and all that kind of stuff and Maria was so extremely extremely involved\nAnd that was then that was then and then you know what's so interesting is that after they found the killer and we went through the trial again which was just extremely difficult um it's\nLike there was no nothing else to fight for ... for her it was so hard um but then for me it's like that when when I woke up [laughter] that's what I won't\nGet back to wait [laughter] if if I'm not mistaken I Know everything says Charlie was Jonathan's best friend but that's not really true it was all in your other son's best friend that's right I don't tell me about that\nOkay Charlie an out to them they were in the same grade they were in the same classroom they were both Thirteen Years old and they were always together playing 'em and just\nGood buddies and Charlie was the kid that had everything and I I have three boys three girls you know six children and um so I couldn't afford to get a lot of toys and things were Charlie was\nThe only Child Left at home his brother and sister were older and they were already married and left and so he had all the wonderful toys he had a swimming pool so of course he was a house that everybody would have to hang out at him and out and they just loved each other they rolled their bikes together they was just\nThey were ... you know they just love being together um but this particular day when Charlie came over\n... and had a concert that day he plays the violin and he had a concert so he wasn't home\nAnd so he came and asked if Jonathan come out\nAnd So Jonathan did and um\n[noise] so it's really to this day it's extremely difficult for outing because he still blames himself thinking if maybe if he was there\nBut not understanding that he was just a kid and the the killer was a serial killer he didn't just kill our boys he killed a grown woman that they have the DNA to prove it in Florida he's done so much so many heinous crimes that and we don't want to stay away we don't know I I don't I don't want to even give them that\nUm he did so many horrible things that I don't believe if if it was out in and Charlie I don't believe the outcome would have been any different because he was a social ... very very clever\nAnd which is again why I wrote this book and he refuses Murray has been to than Clinton um he's on death row and she's been there twice trying to speak to him but he refuses to speak to her may I ask why she wants to\nShe wants to know exactly what happened she wants to know how he got the boys what did he say she wants to know what was you know what was Charlie's last words and what are your thoughts about that\nI couldn't handle it I don't I don't want to know there's nothing he can tell me I there there's nothing he could say to me um it would be nice to know how he got the boys just before I could help other kids but as far as I couldn't I couldn't emotionally handle hearing anything more because\nI Know my son and I know he was scared and I know Charlie was scared and and it kills me to this day and I think about it that Charlie Thirteen Years old the police believe that Jonathan was killed first it killed me to think that Charlie had watched Jonathan die and then knowing so it just ... oh\nYou know I'm you know you Molina and Maria remind me of Kelly and Kerry Kerry Kerry mcgonigle yes and Kelly King you know I'm Chelsea can ever dubois\nBecause you know Kelly God Bless her she uh she's she's quiet about it and to herself about it you know but Kerry cameras mom she went to see the guy yeah and and talk to him and said please tell me you know tell me what happened and and it and you know [noise]\nI just I just I just have so much a\nYou know love for all four of you because there is a connection you guys are we all know each other\nWe are all sisters we're in the elite very special club that no one wants to be in but we were\nForced and by the same token yeah and you are are doing great things now you know we're going to get you know talking about more of that but always fly away [laughter] I Want to know\nAbout that I mean obviously we know why you're doing it for child safety but when did you say you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna do a book I'm going to write a book where before you read it a little bit I Want to say this you know my name's Tommy salon and this is community connection and and my guess is Molina sellers\nThank you thank you how about that but OK well with the foundation the Jonathan sellers Charlie keeper foundation we wanted to teach to educate children on ways of being safe\nAnd so we wrote it out as a way of acting it out mhm you do for the kid with costumes and everything to help them to remember it and in the process of doing that we knew I always knew that it was going to also be a book or something they can actually take home with them and be tangible and they can actually read it themselves um\nSo that's a that's a children's book that I see like a teacher reading the kids at a class right exactly yeah can you uh can you read that book\nI certainly can I be honored thank you always fly away a children's safety book written by Molina sellers Phillips with Deborah darn illustrated by Katherine Johnson it's such a fine day at the end of the week and I would really like to play by the creek\nBut my mom doesn't want me to go alone so I called my best friend who answered the phone my friend says the creek is a great place to meet so I kissed mom did by and she hands me a treat", "year": "2018",
