living here is set to go with the military is such a big part of our humidity of course we can see first cat other men and women in uniform balanced life was serving their country\nAfter their military lives they sometimes a bigger challenge even transitioning to being a civilian instead of going to go but you can help and that's what we're going to talk about today in today's Cuba to reconnect should program operation dress code is underway now that is an effort to collect donations of\nJet Li used professional clothing shoes and accessories to help the women were trading in their camouflage for business attire\nJoining us on the committee connection program today is ready McClain a navy veteran went through our own transition from Cambodia business suits\nThat is helping other women and men in her role as a licensed clinical social worker through the nonprofit mental health systems and through a program called operation dress code which operates the organization courage to call also what this\nIs a program manager for courage to call Christina harder both of you welcome to the program thank you can ... operation dress code I Love the name and my brief little description of a ready tell us what it's about what the purpose of it is really\nYeah so I think that's good actually started four and a half years ago in ... in Sacramento and it was called dress code there and it came down to San Diego and of course we had to give it our own name so we named it operation dress code but it's really about serving are transitioning service members those females that are coming up active duty and going into this\nWorkforce and we really want to wrap around them and support and not only give them business closed but also shoes accessories as well as workshops in a full fun day for our female veterans so\nTo get some of the specifics before we do we tell her audience what the need is and how serious it is when you're talking about helping these women who are coming out of the military\nYeah it's definitely a big need because\nWhen you're transitioning many of us have worn the uniform for over ten years and so we went from high school directly into the military many of us and never really had that chance to wear civilian worker tire so when you wear your uniform put your hair in a bind every day it's very different than going in a business suit and interviewing for a job\nAnd we know when you look ... field guide and that\nHelps you as you try to secure and make that change into the civilian workforce\nIs there a way to ... ... words that you could describe because us through it what it's like to leave the military going to the civilian life form which you can but it was a different stage in your life certainly can you describe what that was just just cut them from a psychological of social standpoint\nYeah well I mean the easiest way is you're losing a part of your identity you are no longer active duty so you don't really fit in with that environment and you're not truly ever going to be a civilian you may be in a civilian workforce but you're never going to a hundred percent identify with your civilian counterparts so you're kinda in this\nIn between ground and you face so many barriers are ready physically sometimes mentally emotionally\nAnd this is you know trying to find close to where it's just one more barrier to some people that sounds simple but when you're Ari compounded with all of these other challenges of trying to integrate into the civilian workforce\nTrying to find just another thing and and acting the part doing their part sometimes very challenging for these women\nEmerging coming out of the military especially been there for ten years or more I mean you come out of every orders life you don't really have to worry about what you're wearing most of the time anyway\nRight absolutely and so when you're in the service it's really about you doing your job you know when and I kind of look at my civilian counterparts an example I went on a business trip recently and the gentleman I was with he had the same suit\nAnd he literally brought three different shirts now if I were the same dress for three days\nAnd magic and how that would have went over\nOn as I was teaching and so it's it's very different for us transitioning as it is you know a a gentleman had there's so many resources for them and it's very different for women coming out\nDid you have a new experience was locked up when you were coming out and you're on a job interview or ... the beating was a prospective employer\nUm well I Will say that at Baylor my friends love to joke that I say I didn't know how to dress for the civilian workforce many of my friends they still don't know how to dress for this to the workforce\nBut um I think I probably weren't my hair and a bond for the first year like steel posts service so I I had a lot of great women around me that supported me so it wasn't as big of a challenge but I see it every day in the work that we do on through courage to call we see women transition all the time and they do face that every day\nI measure that being in the military though there's also served advantage to that in terms of the editor in the work life because obviously your life for those picked up those period of years you learn a lot about just how to relate to people of how to do a job\nOh absolutely it definitely set me up for success in the civilian world I learned how to manage many different personalities and you really get to see I get to see the world when I was in my twenties I got to travel all over the world and see so many different things so\nI get to bring all of those experiences and that knowledge with me is I went into the civilian\nWorld also with us in the program is Christian Christian has a program manager for courage to call the a program that\nIs just part of this operation dress code the ball but let's talk a little bit about operation dress code Christian a little more specifically ready was saying just basically what how this works for them and the closing of donations how do people actually sued if you're if you're coming out of the military how do you take advantage of this\nWell we have twenty different locations where we have a drop off bends\nUm throughout San Diego county a woman who are currently in the reserve that's where they can register for the event that they uh they can also sign up to be volunteers if they want to help in any way even if you're not a woman who is transitioning or who is part of the military can definitely come and volunteer and give your time\nAnd in terms of people who um are looking to donate to the to contribute to the cause of describe what ... used means\nWell gently used is\nLoosely use as hopefully almost new [laughter]\nUm no we're not really looking for anything that\nYou know might have any stains around looking for anything that might have had any homes were really looking for like maybe business casual or even a professional type where that women would really feel confident and going in for an interview or even having as their professional work um throughout the week\n... any woman or anybody wants to contribute to the closing of you have to put yourself in their position right All right well what would you be what would your water where and when you talk to some of the women there's ... was reading a moment ago a lot of times maybe they don't know exactly what they should where they've been in the military for a significant period of time here to see that happen\nUm so yes I met with a lot of women at a hike recently and I pass out the information and they were saying oh that's so good because when I transition I didn't have this nobody you know brought us these\nThese ah groups nobody brought us to these programs it was just going to these conferences this transition workshops and that's it there was no outside resources that we could actually benefit from it and pull items from so it's great that women can come out and actually leave with literally bags in their hands to transition\nTo interesting too when you're sick about it you were saying radio about how you transitioned into those back into the civilian them for having been in the military of oh just socially emotionally and physically it affects you\nYou're probably a lot of people I assume that you find maybe you found yourself that you don't think much about maybe what you're supposed to be aware\nNow when I mean there's so many other things that you think about that clothing is the last thing that you're worried about on when you're coming out that's that's the last thing you think about but it's actually a really important thing to think about as you're transitioning\nIt may not be fair but it is as\nIt is unfortunately that's the world we live in and again I always go back to if you feel good and you feel comfortable and you're wearing and what you have where you know we have this skill set that is going to translate into the civilian workforce we just need to have that confidence in field guide as we do that\nI Would imagine Christian and when you talk to some of these women who have gone through it I measured UC when they walk away with her ... her bags full of a a business type of closing do you see a ... a greater confidence\nDefinitely um because a lot of the women you know whether they are like I said whether they're currently active duty whether they're ... they have transitioned um you know they have children they have other needs that are there to be met\nSo you can always go out and spend what you'd like on professional clothing so just having that need met and knowing that your service not only is important and valuable to yourself\nBut also important and valuable enough to other people to contribute to so that you don't have to spend like you know your hard earned money like we all know that in the military", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Community Connection", "city": "San Diego", "day": "15"}
