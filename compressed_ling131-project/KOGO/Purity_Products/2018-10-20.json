W Bush draw rock a room ... back the legal now your spirit eagle but we weren't perpetrate evil around the world where these\nWeapons of destruction everywhere even inferior or ... did not do one you're going to turn to give people year we're still lives there and that he did go work through were wrong for [noise]\nYou know well I sort of question in their\nRichard it is it is perspective\nUm you know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly where they killed millions a hundred mile in China where they kill millions a and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support\nAh yeah we do sell weapons hard defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances in the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nWe don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder is is evil or certainly in my perspective on I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look for the one today and it's certainly not what my country once\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there\n[noise]\nYeah because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization\nWhich I look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world they don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nUh for for no reason in most places in the world a and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report or somebody look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world and I've seen some pretty bad places\nAnd yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid as Richard pointed out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had 'em for families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGot to jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this\nAlliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War thank you so much Bob here's the kinks the
