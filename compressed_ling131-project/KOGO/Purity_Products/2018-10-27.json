{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "You're older than me are the same age as as I Am as as I remember being told by an aunt of mine that a a a cousin that was being born in the family wouldn't have a soul because she was a test tube babies\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like it was like no they weren't [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where great science writing and science journalism in a book like this is really helpful because it really makes clear to people who\nHow complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense\nRight and you write up\nAfter you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah but yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up [laughter] down there I think you question you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse or some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating ah and and so I I'd I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation [noise]\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... ... we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot\nBut get so complex and soul yawn ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYeah [laughter] you know it's like that's kinda running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on ... you know getting ... getting some coffee [laughter] yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like try and everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher ... so ... ... it was exactly where I'm living and by the way\nTo is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say it's really interesting about the Bible\nIn this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life\nDesk at center so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolved the so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast day I'm David\nGoing hey my question for your stumble and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're kill him and it gives it sounds like a really good question\nYeah under way you would just leave them\nAnd we just love [laughter]\nOh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI enjoy your show but uh\nI've been kicking machine going on forty five years ... macular degeneration I'd like to know from your guest or when you feel that the shoe will be overcome through ... or or\nA maybe a journey either by I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you [noise] go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machinery and\nHe's on dialysis is on ... ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight it they'll not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second generation\nAh that will help actually restore sight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful but\nThat's where we left in with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and uh for your joints spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with both in lines next on coast to coast am this is Ian punted polish and\nHe's paying oh gee oh damn why I say go live\n\nStream made at the world series I'm Jane ... Fox News [noise]\nOf course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think of having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloons filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles the thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplements\nYou took Thirteen Years for doctors to adopt glue ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores\nPeople ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it well it took Thirteen Years for ... ... it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time and it'll get there because patients are gonna take this to the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean\nThe revolution starts with patients and people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these useful levels of ha restored in their body\nNow you've written a great deal about the role of highly wanted gas did in the bodies connective tissue sound as each a work in the joints and the connective tissue\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surround the nerves there's a ... addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve all of these are going to need the special cushioning\nThat ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware\nHe found this purity joint formula and were telling you it work miracles for him why because purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called Hydrox that's taken from olives pat you notice\nYou can put a bowl of olives on your table in a year later come back and except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there\nThey didn't shrivel up and waste away do the fungal contamination so\nThere's something very strong and all is we've known it for a long time Dr Roberta Korea an Italian researcher who is now here in this country doing some research on hide Roxy tier is all extracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things\nThat the molecules do that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so\nWe began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives into ... new ha joined for a meal you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill writes to us this year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nYou see this is the kind of thing we hear and of course there are astounded with is they just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a doctor ... saying he looks like a man\nThat's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe his level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula and of course the Senate\nOn the Internet how fit he looks for his age and you're going to look a little younger because when you were young you had a lot of this now this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean\nAnd it's all safe all natural its purity age a joint formula and pat most of the people who write to me or call me or not people who regularly fall for you might say radio commercials they don't buy stuff off the radio they just out of desperation knowing nothing housework\nThought that take a risk well there is no risk that day\nYou can actually get this far free purity products wants you to get this new ha joined formula risk free\nYou get it you just help them out with the shipping costs that's all and you can get a bottle of this new wonderful ... H H joint formula why would somebody do that because they know people who try this\nSay hey it really worked for me that's why they want people to try it\nStill hold that thought I Want to give the special offer here again our guest bill Saudi here's this special offer the incredible offer the bills been talking about free bottle offered today on\nPurity is new H A joint formula\nThis is purity is next generation ha formula enhanced and redesigned to powerfully support your joints cartridge in connective tissue here's the deal or you pay is just a few dollars for shipping and purity will rush you a free one month's supply the revolutionary AJ joins formula so you can see\nAnd experience the miracle Pilar on a gas it for yourself there's no obligation\nTo quickly see why hundreds of thousands of people are switching to ha called them now get your free bottle at one eight hundred\nTo two to five nine zero two that's toll free at one eight hundred to two to five nine zero two folks now more than ever we need a joint product we can trust one that works on the safe\nIn one that's all natural get started with the free bottle purity is letting you get started for free you heard me correctly free just call them\nAt one eight hundred to two to five nine zero to call now one eight hundred to two to five nine zero to your three bottle is waiting just make the call one eight hundred to two to five nine zero two that's toll free one eight hundred to two to\nFive nine zero to ... billion visited this village in Japan ... they called the village of long life\nAnd assume that people had unusually high H. A. levels in this village where did you find when you met the people's is this is a genetic dietary what did you see\nWell I went there again this summer for the second time with translators photographers and it was easy to understand without studies without even though the town doctor there Dr ... has identified ... gas it\nIs the very reason why these people in ... Hara exhibits such usefulness and by the way they have a lady there in her nineties without any aging spots in her skin perfect skin no wrinkles whatsoever\nPeople living in their eighties and nineties look a lot younger and it all became clear when we were there that they grow a lot of their own vegetables and foods right there near their homes and they have a lot of fresh foods and sometimes they have a little extra so they come down\nTo the vegetable market and bring their goods there to be sold\nSo we were there taking pictures and interviewing people win eighty three year old Mr ... she came driving and on his motorcycle to deliver his vegetables to the fruit markets pat where do we have in the United states eighty three year olds\nDriving their motorcycle down to the vegetable market we don't have it we followed him to his home Oreos up on a thirty foot ladder trimming a tree he works in the fields about four to six hours a day and he introduced us to his neighbor who was nine years old without a wrinkle on his face neither of them use reading glasses\nAnd of course uh he works about six to eight hours out in the field every day this was remarkable I almost felt at I was in some sort of a place where the dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable these people just exhibit\nA youthful this a a flexibility in their joints certainly a healthful mess that we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted him so\nThis had stood out and of course Connie Chung or ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit there in the year two thousand this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself\nBut the ha revolution has come here pat and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom who writes to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age participating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii\nThis past year Seventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joint did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball but the twenty year old\nAnd I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one out that it's pretty popular MSN how does this eighty stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results\nDo and most of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have\nLots of benefits glucose main takes quite a while to kick in MSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil and so these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced it if we can find a way to get that cushioning back that's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young\nReceiving was an advertisement purity fought to say that the valley weighted by the the a product does not intend to design most\nOn radio is ... for music and re\nDownload them free I hardly the U.S today [noise]\nThe following a paid advertisement by purity products at least they have not been evaluated by the FDA this product and not intended to diagnose treat prevent any disease hello and welcome once again you would help line I'm your host\nPat Campbell glad you could join us today now there's some startling information years ago the EPA conducted a study and listen to this they sampled tens of thousands of people checking for impurities in there to issue do you know what they found virtually every single person was contaminated with\nPesticides turbines solving and chemicals\nSo it's a pervasive issue bottom line it's a toxic world we're living in the big question is what are you going to do about it but stay tuned Dr Lebanon has some nutritional inside you're going to want to hear

shocked by what you sent me this ETA\nFat tissue survey that basically shows that we're all contaminated by plastics insolvency virtually one hundred percent of us in our tissue it's downright scary stuff right\nOh absolutely this is a scary subject and as you mentioned that EPA fact issue survey and that was done on thirty three thousand us residents they found her beans plastics chemical solvent in a hundred percent of the samples so basically pat\nWe're all contaminated than the environmental working group back in two thousand six found that tap water\nIn forty two states this time and they did buy more than a hundred and forty on regulated chemicals pat this is the craziest thing of all they do studies of on Bella cord blood they find dozens of chemicals in um bellicose toward blood so I mean what are we going to do about this what are we going to do about this toxic environment to cleanse\nAnd detoxify our systems on a daily basis that's the question so how do we do that
