dot com\n\nHe's paid ... ham why I live\n\nAnd they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to Staten\nStaten work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plant sterile work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol\nIn the intestine plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called my feels into thinking that the plants their roles\nAre actually the cholesterol particles so the mice deals pick up the plant sterile instead of\nThe cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles in that sort of just get passed through your intestines in you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them the point is if you're on that and\nYou can take my answer off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants their roles to deliver the benefits as shown in the study\nThat's something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that laws on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever shown any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow jeeze I was talking about the surgeon greedy and the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all over the world tell us about co Q. ten and why it's valuable for our health what is what does it do\nWell co Q. ten is found in every single cell and your body and they're from the moment you're conceived until the moment you leave the earth\nUnfortunately as you age you lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten\nWord should come to mind pat\nEnergy you cannot make energy without co enzyme Q. ten is the critical pivotal energy\nComponent of every cell in your body Ninety five percent of all your energy is related to the amount of co enzyme Q. ten in your body without an adequate supply you become energy efficient you technically would have energy the fish and sell so\nCohen's on Q. ten delivers a whole ton Napoli of different benefits were putting in fifty milligrams a perfect dose for you to get every single day it's going to support healthy blood pressure\nIt's great for your gums if you're a person who has tender gums maybe when you've lost her brush your teeth you noticed a little ... maybe a little bleeding\nCould be a sign that you've got a co Q. deficiency\nCoincide Q. ten supports immune function\nIt supports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti Oxford and in fact one of the most powerful anti accident ever discovered\nThey're actually taking a look now at Cohen's on Q. ten in its role in exercise and muscle performance\nOne other interesting no coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where one study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled depth than his little was ten weeks or so\nWhen you use topical he's a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and\nSo the three and one product we're talking about these three amazing ingredient extremely safe for a long term use for short term youth in any dosage and I don't know if you saw that report the other day but basically half of Americans are taking\nOne or more pharmaceutical drugs so I Know a lot of people out there listening already taking something they're thinking is this safe should I take it to my doctor\nThere may be no three safer ingredients than the three we're talking about today\nAs if the super bill wasn't enough was the co Q. ten for energy the plants generals for controlling cholesterol and the fish oil

... bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about\nTyler ironic acid or H.

R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offered today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word highly ironic asset and of course it's made it's all over our body it's\nIn our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body but more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby ha it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do\nAnd you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an in space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what H. A. is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically used pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down\nSo that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means\nThat you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but we proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down\nIn molecular weight and more important it needs some other\nAntioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives or their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time\nAnd that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha the body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this\nThe connective tissue that connects all of ourselves that connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it in\nOf course the fountain of youth Stillwater he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think of having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles the thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement\nIt took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement down drugstores health food stores\nPeople ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it\nWell it took Thirteen Years for ... it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time and it'll get there because patients are gonna take this to the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts\nYou call nobody's gonna how do you call that number or they're going to send you a free bottle a full month supply you just kick in a few bucks for the shipping and you're going to experience this for yourself\nWhy that people who've written in and set all these wonderful things there's Harold eighty fifth year he says I'm In and says I'm doing very well on H.
