require thousand dollar but in Iran\nAnd they accept whatever that they're taking out one time and then at that thousand dollars going to let any taxes on it again\nIt's a roster county is that what it's called\nYeah yeah I have found out and I put in that camp like it at a bank or\nSure don't they take that I found out of that five thousand dollar\nYes they take the five thousand dollars out light it like it's ordinary income and so they would take out the appropriate amount that would be equal to the amount of tax you would have paid on that and then once that money gets into the Roth account it has never taxed again\nOkay so that means that I can go and I never would have to pay any\nNorwood your beneficiaries yeah yeah that's that's the wonder of the uh the roster count\nThat with the lowest amount of money then they don't have to be attacked the air\nRight I mean you want to you know you start and the sooner you start obviously it really works for you time as your real benefit where the Roth IRA and if you're starting to\nGet that alarm out and make money at the evidence for thirty five years that money's going to go go go and you never have to pay tax after that it

Google says it\nNow this is important because originally in the wall Street Journal article they said it was a breach\n[noise] so what a breach means is bad guys got in and got data\nGoogle says in fact that they had not happened no bad guys as far as we can tell got in there was no data released and we fixed it in the spring\nAnd that's that [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhat school did not do is tell anybody about that so here's my question do you do companies are companies\nIf there's a flaw let's say in Microsoft Windows if there's a flaw Microsoft Windows a bug like bad guys getting his at Microsoft obligation to tell the world but there was a flop but we fixed it\nOr if apple had a problem with Mac OS or your iPhone that allow somebody to get access to it and they fixed it or they obligated to tell the world hey\nI don't think so\nIn fact I don't think that's a common practice if there's a breach if data is leaked yes I write we all agree that\nWhen a company like Equifax Rick leaks fourteen million consumer customer records a Equifax has a duty to inform because you're at risk and you need to be able to do something about it and in fact that's what the general data protection regulation in uh in Europe requires\nThat uh companies they say within Seventy two hours after reveal a breach and so that's the important difference between a breach at a bug\nBugs happen [laughter] breaches a mean that the bug was used by\nMalicious actors and as far and Google says again as far as we can tell though they don't have a perfect record of it that maybe that's the key\nMaybe that maybe that was leaked and people should know about it anyway people know now Google's ultimate response and it's almost like I'm going to take my ball and go home they put out a blog post this week said well [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay we're just gonna close Google Plus [laughter]\nSo what so in August of next year Google Plus will go away\nSo they're Wall Street journal help you're happy now\nEighty eight eighty eight [laughter] Cleo our website tech guy labs dot com to guide labs\nDot com we'll get to the phone calls in just a second but first word from our sponsor if you need to access your PC or your back away from home I ... you know when I go on vacation last thing I Want to do is access my office computer but sometimes just stuff on there I Need I forget or maybe I Want to surf safely so I\nI go to my office computer answer for that kinda thing\nRemote PCs the program I use it lets you easily and securely access\nA PC or Mac windows or Mac OS from any computer windows or Mac OS you're like you you can even access when does machine from a Mac and vice versa or even from a mobile device like a phone or a tablet it's like teleport ing prices are it's very affordable I use it also protects support to help family and friends remotely\nGreat for individuals home offices small to medium sized businesses because six dollars a month less than to connect up to ten computers are great price but I'm gonna make it even better views the promo code Leo uh check out the ... weekend ...

Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio\nHis daughter has special needs and she was on vacation about Twenty years ago his is a wealthy man he ... he retired and he was on vacation with his daughter and who has special needs and she was playing in a pool with some kids\nAnd when ... when her daughter tried to play catch with the with the kids they just dropped the ball and got out and he said he just couldn't take that look on her face of a disappointment so he decided that there was no place in the world that had a place for people with special needs and and who don't want\nTo come together so he created this water park\nThirty six million dollars\nIn San Antonio and it's all twelve percent of the population has special needs and America that's not a freebie Oh yes\nAnd so now when they're big they're big thing was that you know for kids who are electric or in a wheelchair that's powered by either electric or battery or they have a breathing machine they could never get it wet so they had to figure out how to create\nA wheelchair that was that one hundred work wheelchair oh my God so they did it in a video like that but by using compressed air wow and now what were they need your help is they're trying to build a camp for per ... with a deadline and their ... and there are there and they're having a hard time right now trying to figure out how they can\nDo is lined with kids in wheelchairs are breathing apparatus that that is so cool\nBut you got to watch this video on creating a post right now I'm time magazine actually not time magazine time magazine named one of the world's greatest places\nBut New York times did an amazing video on it and now I'll I'll tweet it or put it in a ...\nIn the chat room but this guy is amazing he really the guys who runs for president United States but anyway um [noise] if anyone has any advice on that that would be great advice on how to figure out how to get kids with wheelchairs up on the line\nOh is that that line oh that yeah well they're pretty they're pretty good because they figured out how to get them on a on a water slide wow as yeah wine\nBut you don't need to take the wheelchair on the zip line or do you\nI think you do so you want to share with them yeah that's interesting very oh so what are you going to try that out and it's such a neat idea Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio Texas for ... magazine\nAnd then you got to look at the New York Times' video but anyway um so then because we're so close to London six hour flight we came over here to see now at least family I said I can I can work anywhere I Am I'm fortunate\nI'm so he flew British Airways have nonstop flight six hours or only sixty five people on or triple seven ... and love it because then you could spread out a fire in the face of its own roe [laughter] yeah basically he did to us and um [noise] so anyway here's another website for you is is\nUm if you want to be treated like a celebrity and I don't know if you've ever seen celebrities go through airports but I see it all the time in LA\nWhen they department I transfer or when they arrive\nThey just get whisked through and so now I figured out how they do it a company approached me and they said try it out and then it's called um black lane pass blacks Elaine pass so black guy I talked about them before because they do a car service real good car service but now\nThey have this past where they had five hundred airports worldwide they will escort you so it was perfect for my mother in law because my mother in law was meeting us in London but she was flying into Heathrow were flying the get wick and she's a little bit of a nervous traveler so I arranged for her to be\nFor a hundred dollars someone was waiting that moment she stepped off the plane so what are you going website leader but you don't have to sign up ahead of time no with no clear is different clears for um security in certain airports\nThis is so when she landed in London literally when they open up the door there was a there was a person they're holding a sign with her name by say grab their bags they walk through they cut the line for on immigration so she didn't have to wait an hour and immigration lines how\nDo they do that I think they got to deal with the costs they border exactly wow and then they get your bags\nAnd then they go through customs\nAnd then you get they put you in a car if you order a car you can order carpet black lane or wherever you could whenever transportation you want you can take a bus but they'll put you on there and she was like when we arrived she's ... like that was the best thing ever 'cause I've been ... I've never felt like this\nAgain so it's perfect for people who are either nervous or business travelers who don't want to\nI Would do this for my mom does not want to fly since eighty five years old she doesn't want to fly in her real fears that confusion once you're on the plane it's minus the confusion getting on and off she's you know she's really getting lost or whatever so this will be a great\nThing I ... a couple of years ago I had my dad's life from LA he met me in Budapest he had to go LA London Budapest\nAnd I wish this was available I knew about it because I was so worried about him getting long lunch and yeah and yeah I I and he wrote my get laws didn't Heathrow it's a nightmare [noise] yes and um so anyway this is a perfect thing for business travelers for families it's each\nThe price a difference but it's usually around a hundred dollars per person\nAnd the nice thing about all of the ... whether you only have one unit or the normal three or four units is this this is they've set a new standard for security they update regularly\nThey often have more features they uh they do things to improve your caught activity over time as they observe what you're doing all of these things make it a better wife I experience for most people\nThere is one downside on mash up and plumes started they started charging you a yearly subscription or a monthly fee\nAnd and the idea is well look we want to keep this up to date will want to keep developing it we want to keep improving it and we're not and that's the problem right when you bought a forty dollar links is router links is just slice their hands and thanks good luck\nI find by and so uh I think it's not inappropriate for router company to say\nLook we ... you know we have additional features you can pay for eroding our one of our sponsors does that as well and I pay for the euro plus\nSigning on bucks you get a lot of extra stuff including a password manager of VPN you get a filtering content filtering you get ad blocking and you get regular updates so that's something to be aware of mesh routers cost more basically both in initially and over time on the other hand they really do make a difference how big is this space\nAs the artist or a house\nOkay so it's not a huge effect most space stations will cover that easily a single ...\nThe question or the concern that I have though is a fight with the airport three of software that through networks ones that it's just one for one for the size you noticed comments [noise] I'm In San ... is from our systems is that while the cat and mouse you can set a separate network for her\nOff yeah the idea that ... the idea behind the ashes will do it you just take it from here and I have to say in most cases unless you really know what you're doing that the best way to do it\nThat people can there's a lot of ... that people can think they ought to choose the channel I'm going to choose a frequency I'm going to make it better and they screw things up so unless you're a network acts are indoor\nOh yeah that kind of set up for it says you need to do it or you have to choose that\nWell the ring should automatically a good I O T device and I will not all of them do this but will no no that that's the two point four and be on the two point four actually with the with the ... I don't think you were to have a problem with that um if you ... it can sometimes be a problem on some poorly designed diabetes stuff where they see two signals\nA five year hurts in a two point four and they choose the wrong one they can't handle that I've had that happened with a device and then you just have to reset the device and choose the other one but in a way that's more likely if you have to you know to ... to ... uh two two brothers one route are two different frequencies you might choose the wrong one so I wouldn't I use the ring with ear\nA he's a plumber ear I use it I have both somebody wrote home I use the ring with the ear oh I'm In no problem [noise] okay so I didn't I didn't do anything special it just to automatically and then like\nA a we know a ... I think it's the last one I actually ...\nWell I I was there have been problems with ... in some way by a a routers so you should always make sure that you choose a router that\nWorks best or works well with your ... devices and we always had problems I Can't remember with which ones\nI Would for the size place you have\nI think you know what's nice now is some of the old school router company has like a Seuss and that gear or doing links this or doing they have you know in the in the kitchen next next year and links as they have ... but they're doing even in their regular you know a standalone single wife ... points they have a lot of mesh features\nSo um if you know you might look at two hundred bucks\nFrom a Amazon the neck gear night hawk that's the wire cutters pick for ... three stream a toe to toe Lebanese sea route or just a little it's a it's actually a one eighty five is a little less than the old airport extreme but I Would say it's very comparable to it\nAnd uh I think they're going to keep that up to date if you want to mash I Love your oh I Love the extra features of euro plus\nPlume is is good in it for a certain things I use it for my generally for my I O T devices [noise] ah because euro is um is very good if it's kind of small focused why\nAnd then another really good choice or is this analogy Archie twenty six hundred I think is a is a really it's two hundred bucks is really nice rather than an allergy\nHas demonstrated that they will keep the software up to date they've really they do that work attach storage devices as well and they really seem committed to keeping stuff up today that number that job one right now for rabbit router is your first line of defense against the bad guys outside so uh since ... a ... year\nWhich of course makes everybody go whoa let's put some more money into the [laughter]\n[noise] so\nFinally they released a developer edition of creators edition this is the thing now to do in Silicon valley you in order to get something like\nThis working you got to get people writing software for it and you want to do that before you actually released a consumer version Google did it with Google Glass good thing because it flopped she's not always a guarantee of success [noise]\nThe Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets same thing that a Kickstarter people you know got the developers edition Microsoft's doing it with their augmented reality headset hollow lens\nAnd usually these developed British ones are quite expensive I think magically developer edition of several thousand dollars I ... a a friend a game consultant brought up by Nicole of sorrow\nFrom zero design and ... and she had been a leap Kahn which has magically speak first big convention in a in the LA this week\nAnd uh so she had one of these creators additions and she had some games games that have been debuted this week at least ... and I got to play with it for a while\nNow I have to say ah one of the problems with these technologies and I remember this very well with the Oculus Rift in the ACC vibe these virtual reality headsets is initially your reaction as war a Mormon in the future I don't think\nI've got this headset on and I've been transported to another world and I can interact with it not really well but can interact with it\nI remember with the with an Oculus again it was actually they see five they had a demo where you're standing on the precipice of the edge of a building looking the skyscraper looking down and you really your heart starts parenting and your oh it's very\nEffective [noise] magically is not the same though by the way I\nAs as wild as I was by a virtual reality I quickly realized is this kind of problem it makes me queasy makes a lotta people queasy after only a few minutes if you use a sweater you don't want to wear this visor for very long my Fifteen year old and his friends they love it\nThey play it all that we have an ACC vibe home they seem to play it a lot\nAlthough I think even they are getting a little tired of it I I'm not sure VR at least as it stands days\nHas is that compelling and so I Want I Want to be cautious when I Try on these new things like the magically thinking well you know initially I Know I'm gonna love this but it was interesting [laughter]\nAh I guess the the thing that take away is we're in early days yet if you are if you were shown\nOne of the old you know asteroids games are long games thirty or forty years ago and told you know some day people will play these for hours a day and it will they will have entire lives in these games and\nIt'll be a multi billion dollar industry a clip seeing even the movie industry and say well\nI I don't get it [laughter] really that Paul wearing the pong stages\nOf augmented reality for sure but I but I I can see a little glimpse into how this might be amazing Nicole told me she said\nI I I think in a year or two a year\nOr two you'll be able to buy devices like this that the that are looked like spectacles oath like your regular glasses maybe a little bit bulkier but not much they don't look ... rock around with them you see the world the world doesn't go away as one of the things I I kind of like better about\nAugmented reality versus virtual reality virtual reality seals the world off you're blind somebody could sneak up behind you if they want and you can't see anything you bumped into walls augmented reality it's just like sun glasses you see everything\nBut superimposed on the real world is other stuff whether it's games or information or user interface so I can almost see and the sounds very good on the magic leap it's really spatial it's you know it moves around you as you\nTurn your head I can see that it's probably in our let's put it this way in our lifetime and the next\nFive years almost certainly\nPeople start wearing these and by twenty thirty twenty twenty five this'll be commonplace everybody will have one just like everybody has a smartphone and it's really gonna change the way we see the world because\nIt'll be another layer superimposed on the real world a layer of information that's always available superimposed in our vision and are hearing over the real world\nDo you get what I'm saying how this might really change everything\nKnow I I don't want to be overly enthusiastic because we've we've seen things like this that you get excited about and then just Peter out\nI don't think this one is they now call it a mixed reality that's what Microsoft calls at our ex are incident VR AR because it can have all of the above you can be in a one of these glasses can do all of those things\nAh and I do think there'll be around and I think maybe even commonplace\nNot too long let's say we'll go back to the phones here and just a little bit uh but I Want to tell you a little bit about something that that probably does seem like magic Twenty years ago\nIf I said you know if you want you can use your computer at the

I have a question they claim that it free why pie for unlimited devices but then they say they throw in a like a hard line I'm ... and I don't quite get\nWhat the hard line for I Know I have on at the house and I think ... my router that helps all my wife by trout house I don't watch hardly or is it faster speeds do I really need it\nIt just comes with it you don't have to use it it it just comes with it so your your service comes into the wall with a hard line right\nWell that's what they have a a they have like what would be an outlet but for a\nYou know and it comes in and comes into the cable modem which turns the signal on the way\nWhat ... what do you mean it came a mother\nWho's or ... what kind of what kind of service do you have is it is it from a phone company from a cable company who's who's the Internet service provider\nThat's what I Need help with I don't know it's off\nThe icy I don't know what I see so they the office the people who own the building said and we're going to include why we're gonna include Internet\nCorrect I got it okay so so they're doing it OK okay\nAnd so you don't know who they're getting it from but they're getting it from a local provider of some kind of go in and then the reason they give you a hard line is because some people want to connect their computers directly\nThere's other benefits to the faster ... and some devices require not everything has why [noise] okay so that's kind of normal to provide that\nOkay you have a Jack you have a Jack ... what we call an ethernet Jack in the wall looks like a phone jak\nBut what I ... yes yes that's exactly right thank you for that\nYes okay that's called ethernet that's a ... is is nice you pay the landlord for this Internet access or they just throw it in with the rent\nThey throw in the shack I don't I think I'm probably gonna have to get my own\nPloy ah by the end of the ... so that's the question as the landlord ... thank you for throwing in they'll jak which is connected than nothing [laughter] that was to you\nAsk them how do you provide Internet access almost certainly they do and I mean it's possible why it's pretty typical though when you read office space that that's wired up for Internet access but that you then have to go to the Internet service provider that his wired ... the place up in in by Internet from them\nOK okay quick question about that do you think it's a possibility for me to transfer my Amish start up company hell do you think it would be possible for me to transfer my Internet company from spectrum to a building twenty miles away like\nProbably not so that's another question for the landlord you have to ask the landlord what Internet is available in this building\nAnd you can't transfer it to your building unless spectrum is wired that building up they may have twenty miles away is not germane one way or the other spectrum is in the neighborhood they may well have\nWe in our building for instance the studio I'm In right now we have the local cable company wired it up they have there's a closet with all of these connections\nIn part of the building and the cable companies there so it was a local a fiber optic Internet service provider called sonic that I think there's other companies as well and they're all in the closet and then you go to whichever company you want to use it has to be one of the ones in the closet and say this one is the one I'd like in my office\nSo you okay do I I think you're going to want to talk to the landlord and say tell me which one of my choices if it's spectrum you could add it to your existing spectrum service perhaps [noise] usually\nCable companies charge differently in charge a lot more for business connections that homo yeah oh yeah so uh but you and you want business Internet because there's you know that they're usually the qualities better et cetera et cetera\nUh do you should see what the choices are and then you might want to do some research by calling the different companies available to you just like when you buy a\nHouse or rent an apartment you ask the previous owners of the landlord well what kind of Internet you get here and ah and they'll tell you what stuff's been brought in from the curb and that's the same thing from a landlord was ... what is available to me on that jak you put in my office\nAnd then I bet you unless for some reason they're the nicest landlords in the world and they just said you know what we're going to pay all the tenants Internet access\nMost likely they'll say okay you have these choices\nI Would do some research to see what business Internet costs and what you get what event\nHappen is they'll wired up they may or may not come into your office in wired up probably what they'll do is if you've got an Internet jak in your office L just what they do they call it lighted up\nThey'll connect it in that closet there's all those ethernet jacks go into that closet and they'll connect that line in your office to the one that's coming into the building into the closet they'll connect those now you're on that company's Internet\nAnd then what you're going to probably have to do is buy a why fire router\nWhen I was gonna say Chili's we did that\nAnd and I found a company that was wired into their wives that with that necessarily be the why fight that they're\nNo that's a great oh they offer you free why fine\nFor unlimited device that's\nNice that's I is it from who's it from say curiosities it from the company that the rent see the building or\nYou know why it at that company puts it in the contract it up\nSo that might be all you need it depends on how fast it is there are things to be considering\nOkay we have an inside office so I'm not I'm On an\n[noise] uh wow a\nGuess I'm In
