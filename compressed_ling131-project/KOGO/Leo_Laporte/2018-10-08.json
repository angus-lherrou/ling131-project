surface pros and surface laptops studios and so forth and at the event they said and today we're proud to say we will begin pushing out the new feature update they call it Eighteen\nOwn mind because in the September twenty Eighteen except it's October but it's close enough so that's it you know nine [noise] last one was Eighteen of three but it came out in may so eight to five but I\nBut anybody

turned out to be really two times a year with these big feature updates\nExcept that almost immediately people started saying whoa the feature up I stole the Wii job they believe in all my documents one guy in the Microsoft\nSupport board said\nI had two hundred twenty gigabytes documents documents folders\nGone well\nThat doesn't seem like a behavior but it also seems weird because Microsoft has tested this as they have in the past with millions of people\nThe current you know eight nine has been tested for six months work there get tested the next one already with these people who volunteer maybe you're one of them it's the windows insider program\nYou'd think if this thing did that except maybe the installers the last piece of the puzzle right maybe they didn't they hadn't been really testing the installer so maybe they did you know forget to tested thoroughly high on no anyway Microsoft and they have pulled back Eighteen oh God\n[laughter] so uh\nYou won't be able to get a teen

Microsoft put out a couple of months ago I saw it on my big surface studio the all in one\nNo problems as far as I Know no documents to lead\nTo some people didn't have that problem the unknown why hope you didn't and don't worry Microsoft is pausing they say that's the word they're not pulling it back then that withdrawing pausing pausing it\nNothing to fear here [noise] ah we had the iPhone

I Need to extend my wife fight so that I can get a\nFire sticks or something like that for the other team east right and they can uh do it but I don't know what kind of range extender I Need or if there's a better brand or me [noise]\n[noise] yeah this is my thing or the most outdoor things would be the wire the whole house by horse but who's going to do that nobody was on the ... of course\nYeah I I keep I'm tempted to do that in my house and the crawl space underneath here in California we tend to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces underneath but then who wants to go under there that's even worse me addict [laughter] lighter so a horse or worse\n[laughter] the cable companies took advantage of the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and I remember there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital Turner and stuff the cable companies pretended\nThat this was a requirement for them to and took advantage of and they all went digital or you know there's advantages\nFor them they can get more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth and just getting digital packets on there so you get more challenges cetera et cetera et cetera\nBut of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over your going over and above your cable companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or you know YouTube TV or whatever\nThey do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other TVs in the house and that can sometimes be Alan ...\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back row and streams some stuff but there's a lot of offering\nYeah what you'll notice on why fires the farther you get the less signal you get and certainly signal you get the less speed you get it's a direct correlation so\nWe want to boost the signal now uh it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point that has they do to to live and I see\nAre you here me ...\nMike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent or micro bites how were you said a decent\nWhy it's not the ESL um [noise] it's just that uh they also have the the the lock I'm mad as well we're very rural so the only choice we had\nOh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now\nWhat I Would recommend it most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours will ... cable company but if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife five router I did I did do that\nYeah okay good so you ... ... if they're if they're cable modem has a wife by a part part of it you know a router part of it just disabled that or at least turn off the wife ... radio\nIf you could turn off the wife by radio that'll eliminate signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I rather than what we called bridge mode say let the cable modem route or because they're still around her and they decide what IP address as we all get but I'm going to use you for why find that usually works pretty well\nYour best way to do this is with the more modern mesh why fire routers um hero sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be from a ... year a veil up from\nIs that links as I can never remember there's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things and these ... are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from all over the years and then they have sub units\nTypically you buy a a a little sub unit for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kind of thing you might might buy more and and these these little extra units are are like repeaters but they're better than [noise]\nSo you can get a repeat or for your existing non mesh system but what will happen is the repeaters takes half of the time talking to the route the base station and the other half the time talking to you so we all wife I extenders cut wife I speed\nIn half [noise] wow that's\nNature of a wife I extend or because they can't operate in what we call full duplex ... they can't they can't do two things at once they can only either talk to the route or talk to you so that split in half\nThe ... have a back channel this is the ... the main difference have a back channel they use to communicate with the base station it doesn't slowed down so the ... and this is why it's the best solution for somebody who's trying to expand their wife ... footprint\nAnd plume is another one that's uh that's I use both plume an arrow in my house there lots of companies all you have to look for mesh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "San Diego", "day": "08"}
