[noise]\nSomebody in a chat room saying are you trying to print something it's true that if you tried to if you had a corrupt print driver which could cause a blue screen and every time you build it up and tried to load that that would cause it it's probably do a driver that's getting loaded when you first turn on the computer how far does it get before blue screens\nWell it does start last\nTime it was interesting case before that a few times they gave me some time and I I manage to get a little research in and bad drivers is one of the main cause of it and so one of the things I tried to do is go in and he modify change out or delete some ... some odd drivers [noise]\nBut I got confused doing I I probably did the wrong thing [noise]\nLet me kind of if I what\nWhat I I Would do here's one diagnostic and unfortunately in windows tenants a different way to do this but if you can start windows ten in safe mode\nAnd you would then not load the majority of drivers your screener would look terrible because you'd have a V. Ga display driving over\nLast night I got into safe mode\nAnd did it run reliably in safe mode\nWell it did but it saves motives when I was trying to do these credit\nIs yeah you don't want I mean you know when he wants to stay in safe mode but if you can boot up in safe mode usually that means that something that's loading some drivers loading not in safe mode is causing the problem so it was so if it was completely reliable in safe mode\nAlmost always I look at the video drivers so the first thing I Would do is is get newer video drivers for your machine is is your machine from a major manufacturer okay so go or you\nMight need to do this in safe mode or another computer but go to jail and go to that area for specifically that computer\nYou know you have a Dell um service number used that to get to the exact page\nAnd download all of the drivers for that system and re installed him sometimes that that will think make it safe a stapler because then you're replacing those drivers with something more up today um I Would bet that is the first thing I Would do and I would bet that that's what's going on it if you are so safe mode ran okay\nIt it did until I started you know trying to do some corrective actions and I was following instructions that I I got\nOn the Internet [laughter] I don't know I got him from Microsoft okay good that's getting to that is a job in itself oh I Know\nVoted that and then I transferred it under chrome on my on my own my own book so I still have that available\nYeah but I\nKind of thing where they have and you do\nIs you know I was confused I'd have to go it would take me a long time to them all and yeah there's\nThe problem with doing stuff and you don't know what you're doing [laughter] you can you can really get all sorts of mischief that way um\nWell no I I appreciate that and and it's you know my wife has said it's time for you to get a new computer and I said well hopefully I can get this done and I was thinking\nIt might be able to here's a here's the real thing to do once you go into safe mode\nType uh you know I just can't type recovery and go into a recovery\nMode that will let you kind of re install a windows it'll keep your data there's various levels there's one level that will raise your drive and you'll lose all your data but there are several levels that will let you refresh windows without racing any data and that's and windows ten has some very good recovery modes\nI Would definitely try those you can do those from safe mode\nUh so I I Would see you know see if any of those tools\nYou have a reset this P. C. which is which is pretty good if you do the reset this PC and choose keep my files it'll refresh the system without getting rid of anything you want to keep you have a backup of everything\nYeah just yeah all my data I'm not worried about my day to have all that\nWell worst case you can wipe the drive and start over she's got a good backup well\nThe thing is I Want to replace the drive anyway within is\nA well now's the time [laughter]\nI was a great time\nAnd if it now the only problem is if it's a hardware problem other than the drivers if it's you know maybe a mother board is your whatever\nYou you might be replacing the drive in the computer will still be problematic for this than it's much more serious and your wife is right and I think given spousal approval buying a new computer is not a bad thing thanks for the call I appreciate it I Want to talk about remote PC before we\nGet out of here it lets you easily and securely access your PC or Mac at home or office anywhere even with your mobile devices as like teleport ing PC Magazine just gave remote PC for stars an excellent rating\nThey said piece rope PCs effortless with a simple interface in learning curve fast performance users can easily transfer files between local and remote desktops\nIt's a great way to do remote support a great way to get files you leave it at home at the office or vice versa\nAnd six dollars less than six dollars a month for up to ten computers it's a great deal except I'm gonna make it even better\nUse my namely or remote PC dot com when you check out you get Ninety percent off for the first year they're practically given away go to a remote PC dot com signed up today\nUsed by named Leo and get Ninety percent off the Leo tech weekend special remote PC dot com thanks so much to Michael cozy our musical director ...

X. I. F.\nThat whole things like the location data that's turned on a date and time of capture\nStuff like that and there's an even further standard called I. P. T. see that as a comes from the wire agencies that can allow you to do even more data titles in ... and all sorts of stuff\nThere's another uh you know uh uh there's other information in there besides just the photo like I see see information so all of this is a is great ah information and most photo library programs will automatically import that data and use it\nYou could sort by day and so forth sometimes if you've got tags and there you can do searching\nI'm going to I don't know have you tried photo me\n[noise] a\nTry this one is free so I like it it's from Germany and you know the Germans do good stuff\nIf I Would like to I went through ... and I cried about a dozen of them so I very well\nCould have his eye you might have and it's a fairly old one I haven't used it in a while but in fact I think I hate to say at\nThe end game in that might be for windows me which would be a terrible terrible thing [laughter] I don't know what I what I typically will do a is do it within light room 'cause that's what I used to process my photos and it has gives you access to all the extra data alive\nI own light room I guess one of these days I'll have to learn how to use\nThat kind of a a ... a a Canada shoot a horse fly I don't think you need it just for ... editing anybody in the chat room have a a a favored or exit editor I Would try this photo meets photo meat dot D. E.\n[noise] um I've also used [noise] I'm trying to remember I don't think I've used on windows it might be on the Mac but there are a number of programs that let you quickly import raw images cause light room is very bad at a raw and I've used a program called fast raw viewer and I'm pretty\nSure yes for windows as well now it's not free but I'm pretty sure fast raw viewer will also let you modify the uh the taxi ex if taxes and\nSo you can try before you buy it's fast raw viewer dot com and that is kept up to date that is a very up to date program\nAnd the reason I like it is because light room is so slow you know my raw photos on some of my cameras or forty two megabytes they're very very big files\nAnd so a PR image so it takes a while for light loaded and Bruce Blair fast reviewers designed to really get you to quickly go through your photos\nAnd uh and pick the ones you like but it also gives you full access to the P. T. C. and the access data so I think that would be even though it's not maybe this is the problem is that we keep pd eliciting is specifically ex if editors but almost all good photo processing tools I think will also give you access to the exits information\nI guess I'm gonna have to break down by camera they only digital camera I got ... ... you\nKnow there's ... there's a look at J. pigs as well yeah it has batch editing of I. P. T. C. data one of the things I use this for is\nUh I like to put in to all the images I import from my camera I like to put in my name address you know copyright information stuff like that and this will do it in a batch format so you can have a standard kind of tanks that you put in try fast rub your you know I don't think you have to have raw files to\nTo use it uh and it will let you\nDo some sorting I Believe by tags by a\nBy the tanks that you put into the access so that was one of the things you wanted to do that's another one too so there's ... there's the uh\nUh what was the forgotten the name the Emmy program phone I mean is it I Can't remember now and uh and then fast raw viewer photo me this photo me dot D. E. 'cause it's from Germany and fast raw viewer\nAnd anybody who has a suggestion you could call or you could put it in the chat room or you can go to the website tech guy labs dot com and and there's a comment\nOr just you know you could just it's free to comment free to visit", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "San Diego", "day": "29"}
