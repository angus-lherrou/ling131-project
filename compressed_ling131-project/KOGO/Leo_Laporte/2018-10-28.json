E. [noise] um I've also used [noise] I'm trying to remember I don't think I've used on windows it might be on the Mac but there are a number of programs that let you quickly import raw images because light room is very bad at a raw and I've used a program called fast\nRaw viewer and I'm pretty\nSure yes for windows as well now it's not free but I'm pretty sure fast raw viewer will also let you modify the uh the taxi ... tags in there\nSo you can try before you buy it's fast raw viewer dot com and that is kept up to date that is a very up to date program\nAnd the reason I like it is because light room is so slow you know my raw photos on some of my cameras or forty two megabytes they're very very big files\nAnd so a PR image so it takes a while for light on a loaded and split fast reviewers designed to really get you to quickly go through your photos\nAnd uh and pick the ones you like but it also gives you full access to the I. P. T. C. and the access data so I think that would be even though it's not maybe this is the problem is that we can pay the listing is specifically ex if editors but almost all good photo processing tools I think will also give you access to the access information\nI guess I'm gonna have to break down by camera they only digital camera I got ...\nNo ... there's a look at J. pigs as well yet has batch editing of I. P. T. C. data one of the things I use this for is\nUh I like to put in to all the images I import from my camera I like to put in my name address you know copyright information and stuff like that and this will do it in a batch format so you can have a standard kind of tanks that you put in try fast rub your you don't I don't think you have to have raw files to\nTo use it uh and it will let you do some sorting I Believe by tags by a\nBy the tanks that you put into the access so that was one of the things you wanted to do that's another one too so there's ... there's the uh\nUh what was the forgotten the name the Emmy program phone Emmys it I Can't remember now and uh and then fast Ravi were photo me is photo me that the e because it's from Germany and fast raw viewer\nAnd anybody who has a suggestion you could call or you could put it in a chat room or you can go to the website tech guy labs dot com and his comment\nYeah it is nice on the iPhone because uh it's\nIt's there before you get into it and and at first responders know how to do with the problem is there's so many different Android phones and the rules for how to do this very\nDepending on which Android phone you have I think that is a big deal [noise] um I don't know if there's a standard way to do it anymore they're used to be on Android and are there in the early days\n[noise] uh you know I'm One way to do it in in you and you and you\nThis will depend very much much angry they have Samsung's for instance have owner and owner info section\nThat when the phone is locked will scroll across the song and at least that would give them some information or you can also in a Samsung phone update your profile and the contacts happened you'll notice there's medical information\nIn there and then\nYou can also a set ice emergency contacts I think that's their by default and Samsung phones\nSo you want to add that it's very important but but look at the lock screened message most if not all unfortunately many Android phones have a lock screen message and you could put information there if nothing else\nPut a a contact phone number because as I said the first responders that's the thing that they tell me that they and if you're a first responder ah oh let me know if I'm wrong on this but I've talked to a couple and they said look what we really want is that emergency contact number\nSo at the very least you know put that in your lock screen message you could say ice in a phone number and people will know what that means the first responders will know\nAnd if you don't have that feature the one last thing you can do and this is true on any phone you know you have a lock screen image the thing that shows up you can\nUse it at a photo editor without lock screen image it puts them information they're now remember everybody will be able to everybody will be able to see that [noise]\nBut ah so you you know consider that but uh almost ... almost ... screen image in the very least you could do you know in just if you do icy events in case of emergency people know what that means and then a phone number that's getting Ninety percent of the way they're long as that person\nWas I was er oh should just do my friends to get an iPhone\nYeah yeah this is something Apple's done really really well I'm a I Wish every I don't know you know Android the problem is Android is not unlike Iowa not a unified ecosystem is lots of different Android phones and lots of different ways to do it [noise] so on the iPhone it's summer\nThe summer I was at amusement park and an older coaster and my phone started ringing so when I when I got off I went and looked at it and it was a local call and I thought what made it as my hotel I better call it so I called and I get the police\nAnd they said we just had an emergency calls from this phone wow and I said oh my God no I just had it in my pocket\nYou know I must have done it I'm so sorry the OJ shows are you on the intimidate or\nI Do yes I Am she goes oh good our GPS [laughter]\nHe knew exactly where you were and you know they probably are going down the hill it's scary\nEnough you could have had a heart attack on that thing I maybe they maybe maybe they knew\nYeah they are yeah I boy I'm you're exactly right tell everybody you know and everybody in your men's group that is a very especially as we get to a certain age that's a very important thing to have on there as you're in case of emergency information [noise]\nUh but unfortunately with Android phones there's no single way to do it as so Samsung phones do have a way and other phones if you at least in the lock screen put it in the ... message or on the screen as a\nAs a text why should it saves a lot my pleasure I'm a look here's somebody saying\n[noise] uh I'm all look on my pixel phone which is kind of the default um Android phone\nTo me saying that they also have an ice entry under contacts some of the search for I see you know all I'm getting is ice cream stores [laughter]\nThat's not going to help my heart health [laughter]\nYeah well it's really a great idea 'cause we all know have phones are in our pockets all the time I'm In a it's a good thing just remember if you do put it on the lock screen message or edit the photo boxing and photo with the phone number\nThat anybody can see that I don't know I don't know if that's a bad thing or a good thing but that's the case or should they brought you by speaking of emergencies carbon I the there's a phone number you should keep icy in case of emergency\nCarbonated as a single vendors solution to protect your data and business it's all about the data it's all about the data and and making sure your data is protected\nThere is a medical id section you could fill that out and it'll have all the information that first responders need if you're on the response of\nBut you've got your smartphone with you you can get the information they need and that does make a big difference in getting help\nIn emergency so that's great well make that the typical week you don't have to follow it all just go to tech guy labs dot com at your leisure and walk you through that on his many different phones as we can find I'll get I'll get Josh to uh to work to find find that out as many different phones is you can tech guy labs that comes our website it's free there's no sign up\nThere's no you

Kodak film and believable you and you of course I have a great book on film photography so this is kind of mecca for you right\nIt is the film photography handbook out I'm\nTotally into that nice um but at least when I'm doing right now but this is talk of the segment is not about Kodak is is that your last target it's your is your old pictures [laughter]\nSo you are where you have just a week old you do [laughter]\n[noise] um I was in Morocco old I spent two weeks in Morocco with a group of photographers and uh well we explored from our cash to ... to ... to ... uh we just explored different areas where we were in the ...\nIn the sand dunes we did a just yeah the photo tour that\nTook the group to um lots of different places were fourteen people in total five cars\nSo we bought a little a little car caravans going from Morocco and I thought I Would pick free off the photos in my I'm In my photo album there's on an album that you have to do you have to accomplish Morocco picks M. O. R.\nO. C. C. O. P. S. E. S. [noise] that has the money on it and uh I Would like to tell you the story behind three of those pictures awesome you you might enjoy that so the first one uh I made a short cut if you do you have to come such zero one\nOkay and it's a photo of a clouds at night over the ... which is kind of the central square the markets and when you were there we spent the evening there we we walked around\nAnd then the Mona ... pretty much the last half hour we look back and that was his big white cloud over\nThat space and in that big white cloud that was lightning wow is it that there was a flash every I don't know ten seconds it was really amazing kind of thing to see and\nI thought I have to kind of document this in some way so I took the iPhone out and they shot the video of it but also of course had my DSL are with me and I ended up\n... ... trying to figure out how can I shoot this I didn't have a tripod I didn't have a um anything to put the camera on\nSo fast and it's dark right I mean it's nighttime\nNighttime so there's some lights down there on the ground but ... now do we capture that and the people wave enough light and without messing it up\nAnd did I weigh ... milking at it right now and this guy's got a break bright lightning bolts and then uh but the people are on the ground that dark the city got different exposed how did you do it\nWell it's only photo so it's it's not an a a montage just one single photo and I thought okay how can I get this lightning and of course you get lightning by using the longer exposure [noise] um but then on the other hand how do you make the lightning up the mountain to make the exposure not so long that you cannot handled it anymore [noise] and\nI decided on a fifth of a second\nOh benefits the second is kind of still\nCan hold up with a wide angle lens that I use um which I knew it would get some motion into the people which isn't the problem I ... it probably that's a bit of a flavor picture in mind and just keep shooting burst wow as in ...\nI spoke to one of the ... second moments you'll get a lightning bolt\nI took a look at the two hundred pictures while to\nGet this one so I uh filled up part of my card [laughter] wow and when I came when it came back I looked at them and there was the one photo that worked out so that was\nThat was just I'm so happy because that is the photo that says this is something that doesn't happen you know that doesn't happen it won't happen I won't see something like that again in the rest of my life I'm pretty sure about that so\nEvery photographer I think has that one shot that was just perfect timing and what's good thing to remember\nThe master boot record you want to pay repair the boot loader and windows will have will do that for you it's an easy thing to do it a couple of ways to do it one would be to get into\nUh the uh\nUh ... windows recovery menu so while you're booting up tap F eight in the recovery menu\nYou'll click on trouble shoot advanced options and get into the automatic repair menu and then there's a tool called boot wreck dot E. X.\nSee that will restore your boot record it's enough of a complicated process and I want you to follow the steps in order and accurately that I'm going to put a link in the show notes to or you could just Google it to a a a step by step 'cause you want to do it accurately\nUm so you could also use disc part to do it but that's a ...\nThat's a little bit more tricky I'm not sure I'd recommend that I think you want to really use\nThe built in windows recovery features so um [noise] yeah well yeah you can you give if you search for fix the MBR or fix you we have\nFive boot you'll find a number of articles or don't do the ... I I Would suggest not to do the one using the disc partition or cars that you could really mess up your disc if you start mess with it this partitions\nUse the built in windows tools to do it you'll be better off [noise]\n[noise] yeah I've seen where it's ... it's a lingering in um [noise] um they they tell you that it would be a non Yulia by a\nAlright yeah so even though you can't just delete the uh Linux partition and and be OK you got to kind of restore everything the way it was windows recovery if you had the windows restore disc or window and ...\nYou can also do recovery mode from there and fix it all up windows wants to boot wants to be the boot manager\nAnd as soon as it sees grub it'll say wait a minute and it'll ... it'll fix it all up so just put into your installed disc or I'll put a link in the show notes\nTo um some set up\nTools that will do it this ... wreck is supposedly I have never tried this was supposedly fixes and in future when you install Linux\n... you know you\nCan really this is not at all uncommon it's easy to get into trouble when you do a book do boot system very easy because windows doesn't like to have another operating system on the hard drive [noise]\nUm and if you just delete Linux oh man you're in trouble so which is what you did I think so you you got to get a little bit more you got a little more work on here will put it in that will put a or a guide and they showed us that should be able to\nSave your baking speaking of Lennox I see the big news in the tech world just came out IBM\nIs purchasing a Linux that for many years we recommend that we use red hat remember red hat Linux you ever hear that name they become they were one of the first companies to actually make money\nDistributing a free operating system called Linux or they're buying this man apparently it's worth a lot of money because IBM's buying red hat and the deal valued at\nThirty four billion dollars it's IBM's largest deal ever ever the third biggest in the history of us tech\nAnd it's kind of a premium red hats\nMarket capitalization is about twenty billion so they're paying a fifty percent premium on their market cap a hundred and Ninety dollars a share\nA that shows you how important Linux has become specially to uh enterprise to business and and and cloud business but wow a that is a huge deal\nIBM buying red hat Linux clinics the free operating system clinics\nFor thirty four billion dollars shows there's money and free\nA [laughter] while our ...

I think they're going to have both lightening and see so will find that out on Tuesday [noise]\nUh I'm actually ... would be thrilled to see them release a new Mac book care that is a fabulous and that's the one Steve Jobs introduced it was in a manila envelope but they haven't updated years\nAnd the screen is very low resolution so making a high resolution inexpensive ...\nWould be a very good thing they you know ... are so expensive now that many schools have stopped buying them So Apple would like to make a sub one thousand dollar back book and I think it'll be updated ... care when I when I say one thousand dollars I'm Talking nine hundred Ninety nine dollars and Ninety nine cents\n[laughter] oh it won't be a lot under a thousand\nThere'll be a new Mac many this one is this is the rumor I find it hard to believe but I have my fingers crossed apple has an updated its back many years I think for years and this is the device is always was the cheapest Mac because it didn't include a mouse keyboard\nOr monitor it was just a little box that you would\nUse your existing mouse keyboard and monitor with\nA I Hope they do update that it'd be nice to see modern chips modern storage modern conductors automatic many a lot of people by my we would buy some here at our studio a it'd be it's a great way to to get a full powered Mac at a lower price\nSo we'll watch Tuesday and I'll get up early 'cause it's seven am Pacific time\nApple is expected to stream it so you can watch at the apple website and see what they do we'll we'll do our own stream I like to I have a bad habit I

somebody is looking for an iPhone it doesn't want to spend a thousand dollars of life on tennis costs\nSeven forty nine for a sixty four gay guy phone ... it's an LCD screen that'll lead but it looks beautiful\nThe best battery life of any iPhone and I think that's important yeah only one camera lens not too big deal is still the photo still look great it just doesn't have that optical zoom that you have on the iPhone ... fine with me\nFine with me or the ten are if you're looking for new wife and I think it's a very good choice and it comes and colors black and white and that there's a

sports car it's beautiful of course it doesn't really matter what color you get because it's made of glass and it's slippery so you're going to put it in the case so\nSo I guess it doesn't really much better [noise] we'll find out Tuesday a with apple is up to\nA and if you have an Apple TV or you can go to the apple website you'll be able to watch the streaming and see for yourself there's more in
