so we're going to do so let's just some real estate stuff here we haven't done any real estate for for a while or were trying to get to some other things\nA ... a National Association of realtors came out with their report\nFor September and ah and again no surprise existing home\nSales\nDeclined by three point four percent in the previous month from the previous month sales are now down four point one percent from a year ago a big deal you're offering how prices well prices continue\nTo to go up by the median existing home price for all housing types in September was two hundred fifty eight thousand one hundred dollars that's up for point two percent from the same month a year earlier\nAnd inventories inventories decreased last month which was a surprise to me because we were seeing some evidence that there might be going a majority would be on the rise but they say that\nUh there are uh they they decreased from one point one million units are in the in August to one point eight eight million existing homes for sale\nUh in September so we got that going on force also and this is the one that always cracks me up\nA first time buyers first time buyers were responsible for thirty two percent of sales in September and that's almost a a locked in number month after month after month we find that first time buyers\nRepresented a third of all transactions wait a minute wait a minute\nIf you listen to the media and you look at all the reports in the paper people can't afford to buy a house especially those beleaguered first time owners people buying a home for the first time they can't do it houses are so expensive\nHouses are a A R R rare there's a a small inventory of homes for sale\nBut yet month after month after month after month a third of all transactions to buy a\nHome our first time buyers and don't get it I don't get it okay\nIt's amazing these kinds of things isn't it a here in the west by the way existing home sales are did fall less than the national average and\nSo we're doing okay there was one home that did sell here in the west or this past month\nAnd it's got a great story too in great great story the a long game has once again paid off\nFor the oracle of Omaha in other words by an holds OK investor Warren Buffett has sold his longtime home in Laguna Beach for seven point for seven million dollars okay and they did cut the price by three point one percent um recently\nAnd I guess that was enough to trigger a buyer the multi level home built in Nineteen thirty six and sense remodeled takes in ocean views from its corner lot in the emerald bay area if you've ever\nBeen up in the in that area you know what I'm Talking about okay in beautiful beautiful neighborhood all I'm looking at a big picture of the whole neighborhood here\nEvery house there looks like it's painted white that's kind of weird the home as nearly thirty six hundred square feet\nOf white walled living space a family room with a fireplace a formal dining room a sky that a sky light atop the kitchen there are two a sweet bedrooms each with a separate entrance sliding glass doors open on three levels of ocean facing decks and terraces\nTo garages that combined offer space for three cars property originally hit the market in February of two thousand Seventeen for eleven million dollars and sold for about seven and a half\nMillion dollars um [noise] [noise] how much did you pay I I Know what you want to know is how much did Warren Buffett pay for this house that he bought\nIn Nineteen Seventy one beachfront property in Laguna Beach\nFor seven and a half million dollars he bought a Nineteen Seventy one [laughter]\nFor a hundred and fifty thousand dollars I'm not kidding you he paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this mansion in Nineteen Seventy one that he just sold for seven and a half million dollars good lord wow\nA says here last year or the ...\nNo I don't need to read that that has nothing to do it but man and you know what whoever buys it is going to spend a lot of time and money remodeling it because it's not a fancy house it's ... it's great on the outside but the inside I think from what I've read in the past is very very plain\nYou know really not very fancy it's got a nice got a nice a lot of nice patios with pretty good ocean views and stuff like that the kitchen\nI like my kitchen better than the kitchen and I was looking at a picture of the kitchen right here and it's got a case got skylights big deal okay it's big it's a gigantic kitchen um but it's kitchen nothing fancy about it to somebody's going to come in they're not going to tear it down I Would imagine\nBut they're going to do a lot of work on this thing and make it their own\nTheir own personal player a favorite or something so that's what's going on a one thing when I did one other thing here real quick I'll say some of the Peter Lynch stuff for next week or this is from the files a criminal files of the securities and Exchange Commission okay uh they say that I'm\nI'm earlier this month\nThey entered a final judgment against the founder of a main base medical marijuana company and twenty five affiliated or entities I related to the to a a to an investment ... and solicitation\nThey did on Craig's list the bad guy in this thing was pitching these miracle a medical marijuana companies on Craig's list\nAnd how many people were stupid enough to buy in on this thing okay according to this he raised approximately five hundred thousand dollars from at least fifty nine investors by offering securities and twenty a cannabis related entities\nThat he formed which purportedly sold medical marijuana products they did not contain THC the chemical compound\nResponsible for most of the ... ah marijuana's psychological effects they complain\nWas instinct yellow or blue then I well I can attack them and take over that gym for my team and others can help it's also kind of a communal game you run into people playing and all the time I was thinking about it take us today is what they call a community day once a day once a month for that they do a big community day\nAnd that people will be out and about right now actually capturing special [laughter]\nYou know when you talk about it that's really really special little ... on\n[noise] that are all out and about\nSo if you see some people are wandering probably buried in their phone\nThe uh the distinctive sign of a ... player is that they're swiping briskly up the phone that's that's tossing the ball to both of mine to capture it sometimes swirling their finger in a circle if they're in advance player or if you see them wandering give them a little leeway don't aim your car asked them\nIf it would do me a kind of just pause let them go oblivious on their way there in half half in this world walking around half in another world\nWhere there are capturing\nLittle pocket monsters\nIt's ... it's kinda fun actually I thought today it'd be nice to talk about nice things happy things I don't know if that's a nice thing or a happy thing but from from from my wife and me it's kinda it's kinda cool because\nUh we walk we we

V. receiver that's the first cost and that's about three or four hundred dollars and then for anywhere from a thousand a Fifteen hundred dollars you can get\nA five point one surround systems that sounds so much better so much better speaking if you know we're going to do we're going to change microphones 'cause I I thought I'd steal Heather's microphone I'm getting paid for the\n... paid back for it because her microphones a little buzzy oh it just got better a little bit let me take another call and I'm gonna switch microphones while we do that a back to line one mark in Grand Rapids Michigan\nHi Leo good to talk to my friend [noise] I'm a I'm thinking I made a mistake about three months ago when I went back to a Comcast for TV [noise]\nYeah what happened this or you you were what were you doing before Comcast\nOr a TV we were string\nWe cut of course there you said I don't want cable I'm going to save money I'm going to get everything over the Internet or over the tough as they did that save your money just out of curiosity\nSay quite a bit of money and about a hundred dollars a month Tice lot nine and ten of put on the house and that was good\nBut that's the best deal and television is over the air if you can do it\n[noise] yeah well that's why I went back contests I started having the big problems with the uh am tell yeah so anyway Comcast you get a little itchy you know so they're given some really good deals out so yeah content for TV\nI remember I here's the deal and Comcast if I could come cast also if you go into the office because they have offices\nAre often they're like storefronts and up and talk to the human or ... or you can often get a great deal they have wonderful offers but the trick is the only uh you know worked for the first year\nAnd then all of a sudden you build doubles so the trick and I asked I asked the woman she said yeah we we always have something just keep coming back before the for the years out ask for the new deal\nYeah so that's just something to keep in mind [noise]\nYeah I got a really good deal for ten years actually you're the one you're caches HBO Showtime them ... or so\nA number of cases yeah you got but it's all just got to pay attention to it so but what's the ... but now are you glad are you sorry what you said you had some issues\nWell one issue is the remote we got the fish and then I'll get I Love that ... that you couldn't talk to by the way that's\nGreat that is a nice feature yeah Comcast is working hard with the ex one systems of words to compete with you know really what is a threat to their business model which is people like you court cutters so they they they want to make sure they're offering something for that extra hundred and twenty bucks\nPretty good anyway the other day you know for the Internet for every other day I woke up and\nNo Internet connection do you go to a browser and wanted to activate right listen to the table right if you will not afterward I have an air is us the surfboard sixty one forty one ... boxes three\nIs that is that that yours or that that one the Comcast provided you have your own\nYes it's my job I like those air is so here's what here's the way this all works uh the cable company sends us say say they spend a little signal down to the modem to activate it\n... isn't this fun kids don't you want to build your own PC [laughter] but that's how you learned right\nYou you know I hardly David all this stuff makes sense to me because I've done it a million times I Know exactly where what you're going through\nAnd um it's kind of you know and just a pain you gotta keep going through it do you have do you ride Harley says well\nNo no I Know but it's like that isn't it like your breath on my own personal highly um well\nI uh I don't know what else to do you know bad capacitors would have the same thing\nAnd that was a problem for a while but I think those have been pretty much just solved as well\nUm [noise] boy I you know you ... usually\nIf the mother board has issues you know there's a perhaps the ram is not being seen you'll get posts code she'll get beep some groups but it sounds like you're not getting the power on self test you kind of it's freezing right at that point\nRight [noise] yeah and I don't you know ... off the top of my head I don't have a good solution for you on that one anybody in the chat room or listening wants to call in and\nMake some suggestions is not it's not posting I think because ah it's it's stopping at the post otherwise you'd get something you'd get you get sounds at least so\nIt didn't have any little uh other trouble like a like log files or ... laws\nNot getting a log files so there's nothing to look at [laughter] uh you you know I'd refreshed the bios\nYou know make sure maybe maybe it could be the bios got corrupted fact that's that's that's a seems like a likelihood\nAt this point in and that's remember that's stored in the ... changed the batter but at the same losses only apart that only clear as part of it the if the frame where itself is damaged that's actually a\nProblem that's the equivalent of you know that's scary thing when you're updating the from wearing a mother board and they say don't on plug it if you do so and so it may be that that's that that's what's happened 'cause it sounds like that's not getting run that it's it's freelance by\nThe only thing I haven't done is maybe just rains do the ... or more if you\nCan yeah I Would certainly try that [noise] All right well and good luck might yeah\nUsed to be I mean this is a fun thing to do as a hobby to build a build your own computer and it's not hard in fact I think every uh every parent should make their child\nTo this one [laughter] it's not

Copa I've actually interviewed her on this game it's a great book and it's about modern cons and their relationship to\nThe old cons breeze a fascinating a person she's actually become a poker champion she's writing a new book about up high stakes poker in order to do that [laughter] she's a become a poker chair and she's brilliant\nBrilliant but her book the confidence game is a great read if you want to kind of understand I'm sure that's been excerpted magazines you could probably find it on my ... parts of it on line to understand these old games and how they're you know the pigeon drop games do you ever see the sting or ... I Love I Love con men\nA lot of great movies and books about con that\nThey're just all of those games have made it to the Internet and new\nKind of clothing but the same exact idea and in general if I were to generalize all of these games play on one thing you're read\nSomething for nothing so that's the that's\nThe alarm bells something for nothing as the alarm bell\nIn general things like the pigeon drop require in the long run you to give them money in order to get more money back that's how the Nigerian prince scam works for instance you ever get that email sure you have\nA low I'm a Nigerian prince I have twenty million dollars I Need to get it out of the country fast and I need to help somebody in America\nI'm going to get in return for which I'll give you ten percent but if you answer those emails eventually they're going to say you need to put some money in my account just to pay for transit fees or whatever\nThey're going to get money out of you so all of these ... games in the long run will take your money but the way they do it is by promising you something for nothing so just don't fall for that you know that you're you're smart and the the just be aware of the Internet is bringing these wonderful\nFun things into your home as we entered late stage predatory capitalism\nBut there's some some of this is fine you know if if you use Facebook and you love face but you get a lot of Facebook you know that the information you're giving them they're using to\nSell ads\nThat's fine that's a fair trade as long as you're doing it with eyes wide open same thing with Google we get so much value added things like Facebook Google Twitter Instagram\nThey're all free but but there's something there there's a way they're making money 'cause they're not free for the guys who run those companies is expensive so what are they make and how they're doing it generally it's advertising speaking of which is wonderful show absolutely free but [laughter]\nThat's only because we have fabulous advertisers now I'm really careful we pick ads and advertisers that are products that use and like so I don't mind I'm happy to recommend like remote PC there is a good example happy to remember recommend remote bases a wonderful tool\nVery affordable you get great value for your dollar it allows you to access\nAny computer a Mac or a PC windows or Mac from anywhere using a Mac or a PC or even your mobile devices that is very handy I Do a lot of tech support for family and friends that lets me I put remote PC on their computer mind\nAnd then I can log into their computer I can change things that can move things around I could upload fixes download files it's awesome great if you have a home office and you leave stuff at work and you want to bring it home or vice versa [noise]\nNormally very affordable fast it's efficient it's secure and it's only about six dollars a month for up to ten computers but right now I've got a better deal and this makes it really worth a try it's one of the reason I'm happy to get these guys on our show if you use my namely or check out that's the ...

yeah what are we looking at we're looking at a black and white photo of\nSome mask that has uh you you can see the front of a baseball hats\nOn it but it's all very out of focus very artsy very eye

[laughter] I I think of it is a really classy high like pheasant I Love them and they're perfect for TV 'cause they have no brim so they don't block the light\nOptions out there that I Would recommend\nOutdoor cameras a nest it makes outdoor cameras I have to invest outdoor cameras that work quite well from a nest dot com and then I'm a ring also makes outdoor cameras have lights on them that can come on and so you can see everything that's going on all of them work at night so you're saying her camera\nShe is she's seeing what what is what is\nWhat is going wrong it's not recording it's not she's not seeing video what's going wrong\nFor some reason it um I think the video was in coming up it was a ... a long time ago sometime last year that there was some kind of an air message popping up\nAnd she pointed mobile app\nHonestly I Would just throw it all out or try to sell it on ... and get a nest camp [noise] I'm so much cheaper I ... at any effort you spend any ... what is this guy going to cost you know to fix it\nIt seems like a lot of work um and and frankly not as convenient solution the DVR solution is the old way of doing this just recording locally [noise]\nUm so I Would I honestly that's what I Would do there's a nest came out during his campaign two hundred dollars\nHigh definition or does need why fi access because it's it's connected to the Internet via wife find the nest has a website you can go and see what's going on at any time or you can see previous you you can get alerts on your smartphone instead of having a TV set up with the DVR she's using her phone\nI'm I'm ... it's hard for me to diagnose what's going on with the camera at this point because I don't really understand the question\nWell the thing is that she had a mobile app for it and I'm ... I don't know all the details to it but I'm basically the question is if I get the DVR replace\nDon't replace DVR and please [laughter] that's going to cost you so much money for a sub optimal solution\nI I think she's got a uh she should\nWrite the whole thing off a the camera records to a DVR via some cable\nThat she's got attached to the cameras that comes into the business is that it\nYeah and it's all connected on it and I mean her network I mean her home network and everything so she was able to heal it remotely [noise]\nSo I just want to know is there some kind of like a like an app or we can have our own home set up and be able to view it they're like a certain apps without having to go through other services [noise]\nWell if you're going to do it on an app over the Internet you got to be stored somewhere [noise] um is there is is it a privacy concern or is it a cost concern\n[noise] all the above okay [noise] um\nI think you could trust nest they're not looking at the video I'm the first costs a I think it's it's considerably more for we've already spent more money on this thing then you'll spend over you know five\nYears on the mess up the picture is going to be better I just don't know the brand that she has a I'm not sure he again what you\nKnow name yeah sure what you're trying to do you say you you ... the guy says well if you could tell me the error message I can fix it and she can't see the message because she's not seeing the video is that the problem\nYeah Ali hook up to it because it has an H M I advocate for allowing hook up aged because that's how she used to have it connected to her old TV she gave us\nOld TV and me sell because that you are without work anymore with getting I Am at the edge but now she wants to see what the era what age she and my only connect it to her computer monitor and um you know just play though I'm thinking that might be something wrong with an H ...\nKind of fight just throw this thing out bullies [laughter] you're going to spend\nMore money trying to figure out what's wrong and you're going to get a sub optimal solution anyway and it's going to break again\nUm there are so many companies that do this my recommendation would be to look at ... dot com ring dot com or they don't have outdoor cameras at a wise cam which is\nThe least expensive but I've got these wise cameras everywhere they're so inexpensive I actually have one pointing out a window it can it then it's indoor so that's okay but if she doesn't have a window I Would go to nest dot com get a they have outdoor nest cameras that worked fabulously\nOr you can see what's going on at all times you'll get alerts on your smartphone you don't have a DVR because they store the video is so much better uh all ... as long as she's got why it'll work just fine and she needs somewhere to plug it in but obviously she's got that for the old\nSystem or if you go to the wire cutter dot com and you look at their recommendations for the best outdoor security cameras\nBut they can't see each other you could then if you want to have for why fi access points each one attached to those\nAnd those would have different names and passwords for each tenant\nAnd uh they would then be securely a surfing so that's one way to\nDo it [noise] a\nLittle more expensive one thing you might want to look at doing is if you're going to do that is use the ... to route ethernet cable to each tenants apartment and then connect the wife by in their apartment which should give them better access [noise]\nUm so so you said with the editor acts that just one device on\nRoute or all the white yeah then you need for why fi access points right ah and put them in bridge mode and they each have their own discreet Internet basically so it's creating for virtual\nNetworks [noise] okay so that's probably the\nThat's the most secure fastest way to do it um and then it's more expensive 'cause you got to buy for access points but if you're just buying why fi access points you're not using them as routers you can get less expensive ones probably under a hundred dollars that are just why fight [noise]\nOkay um and so another thought I had was just just putting out in and letting the attendance decide if they're worried about the security\nThat that's the other option routers yeah yeah that's the other option they can absolutely secure at themselves and other ways yeah\n[noise] um [noise] so I guess here's\nHere's one thing you might get you you kind of do want to be aware of but one of the things he has read her ex will do\nIt for you is give you an idea of who is using how much bandwidth what are the issues that can come up is that one of them is using so much bandwidth nobody else can get on line right so that would have that a dish and you have a lot of metrics from the edge router that will give you an idea of how much bandwidth each each attendant as you say [noise]\nOkay um I also have one comment on the previous caller ... ... yeah um I've done a lot of cameras dolls and I ... I don't know she didn't mention how many cameras\nThey had on them but if you're talking like one of the DVR we're doing like a kid you know twelve cameras there you know as some of the slave owners or you'd have like maybe twenty or something\nYeah that's a different story you're right that's expensive to do that with these a nest cameras consumer cameras yeah uh 'cause you have to pay for the storage for each camera that would really add up\nYeah I Would think that so I was going to do cameras here would you recommend like the ... camera for that\nAre a lot of them a lot of them yeah absolutely and that you know there's a subscription they give you a deal you should you should check to see how much it costs per camera and you don't have to store you know you can store months worth of data or five days worth of data you get to choose\nAnd so that might be another thing to you know check the pricing on that but I think these are really good and and they're very high quality cameras\nUm there are cameras if you go to the wire cutter dot com and their review there are cameras that have no subscription fee or they don't store nearly as much but maybe you don't care right because\nUh maybe if anything happens if you have three days that's plenty [noise] yeah so that's another thing to look at the wire cutter if you look at their security camera reviews talks about some that have no like the ... that they don't unfortunately do an outdoor camera but the wise camps don't charge you for storage\nUh you're responsible for your own storage in effect on camera storage\nI'm the one that has no subscription ... circle to will only do twenty four hours of storage free so you just have to you know you have to care only about the last twenty four hours\nTo any of them have an opt in for a Oregon are on a device like a a USB stick or yeah\nOr as a memory the wise wise scams or an amazing deal W wise III there twenty and thirty dollars thirty dollars just for the pan tilt zoom you can control via the Internet they charge nothing for storage 'em and they ... but you you if you want storage you put in a little micro S. D. card into the camera\nAnd it will then store it locally okay those are great they they need power only are they are why five based and they're very cheap [noise] yeah that's a ... but they don't but so far they don't have an outdoor one although these these guys are kind of blew my mind I imagine they will have an outdoor one at some point\nI bought a number of these wise camps and I'm I Can't believe this thirty dollars I Can't believe it [noise]\nSounds like a steel yeah\nYeah they've been around for a while people are very happy with them I've had a great results and even if they let's say they break every year who cares [laughter] right [noise] uh and and they're pretty robust because my son every time he finds that throws it on the ground unplug the threat he doesn't like having a camera and the F W Y. Z. E. C. A. M.\nDot com or these are kind of amazing little cameras twenty dollars for the one that doesn't move you just pointed somewhere and thirty dollars for the one that you can control via the Internet you can steer around by the Internet\nThey're not a sponsor I just think they are amazing our show today speaking of sponsors brought to buy carbon I look you're talking about security and the one thing I always say and I don't think enough people here is ...\nIs security means having a good backup having data protection and if you're going to get data protection and business you've got to go to the leader carbon I dot com they have solutions\nFor every conceivable option on premises servers cloud servers hybrid solutions replication solutions for high availability that means real time replication or is constantly going on so if something happens\nCloud fail over and you're instantly back up and running a business that's vital right every minute of downtime as revenue lost they support virtual machines they they cover over two hundred operating systems applications and platforms carbonate is\nIs a single vendor solution that will simple fire environment eliminate gaps in your data protection reduce costly redundancies\nAnd they'll do it well and affordably and securely they are truly a secure trusted provider and of course great customer service seven days a week you got to check it out\nIf you're in business learned more about carbonate data protection platform for business at ... dot com bubble court the tech\nGuy eighty eight eighty eight and we have more calls coming [noise]\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had the look of a beautiful empty so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nIron works safe at rhino safe dot com\nAmerican Made an antique styled our Shapes Our part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you like the classic look of our rhino iron works apes we also feature beautiful matching tool chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and to a huge network across the U.S we've\nThat is every company in technology now like prefers to get and that's a shame but it's a way it is the first to get that monthly annuity and as opposed to one big chunk of payment actually if if they could they get a chunk\nPayment and among Leno that maybe that's the that's the future [noise]\nEighty eight eighty eight athletes that's the phone number ... report\nCouncil [noise]\nNews radio six hundred go go live local\nAnd the cocoa new center I'm Phil for our here are some of the stories that we are covering and we begin with the midterms President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden\nThey campaigned on opposite sides of the Nevada state race yesterday as the nation prepares to vote in the upcoming elections and we have actually some early election results and returns even though the election is in for a couple of weeks\nEarly voting began to change that I never I there are already out showing a Democrat or leaning Republican for an awful lot much higher in voter turnout and four years ago now might have gotten a crack vantage will home the ants and are storing and out of harm's way primary count Biden stumped\nFor the Democrats and event hosted by countering intend to ... percent less than a thousand on hospitality worker\nBiden had Republican destroyed American values built over a century\nHappening to flip twenty three in the house you can't control Africa than at a club to mount an hour with forty nine Democrats and one Republican that Republicans have been working overtime\nTo make sure that Dan don't make any surprise scale ... my parents are critical about ...

one Daniel in Long Beach\nHi Daniel Daniel yeah I mean a little I'm Leo your Daniel let's make let's get that clear okay are you from are you familiar with Web design a yes I Am\nA no ticket what ... what are the minimum ... there's all these different languages like what\nYou want to become a Web designer Daniel is that your goal\nI'm thinking about it they do something on the site so in the\nEarly days of the Web or a Web page and actually still true today when you actually look at this what they call the source code of the Web page a Web page\nIs composed of a couple of different things HTML which stands for hypertext markup language is the kind of the fundamental the route language of a website and it's it's markup language which means it's very simple says this text should be bold this text should be a Talib size this tech should be big\nThis is an image this image should linked to this when you click on this text you should go to this Web page that kind of thing that's HTML [noise]\nAh yes yes that was added later it stands for cascading style sheets and the idea was you could encapsulate information credible it in a way it's like a macro language you could say whenever I use this HTML tag what I mean is this ... this type size this kind of thing\nAnd see us that's been used it increasingly to style pages the whole idea nowadays a website is you want to separate the contents of the website from the display from the layout of the website in the early days we pushed it altogether you'd have\nYou know HTML tags followed by text followed by more tags and you could actually do that in the text editor we've gone way beyond that so modern websites almost always have a data back in which has the text the images the contents of the site\nAnd then information about how to display that which will include three different kinds of things HTML is still there\nA CSS the style sheets still there and then the third and nowadays most important part his job a script almost all Web pages today use a programming language called job a script to do the fancier sings animations sliding menus hidden things\nAre a lot of that is done in job a script\nNow in order to so really if you say what language should I learned to do Web design it's those three HTML CSS those are the fundamental things you need to know those\nAnd then job a script is the ... is a true programming language\nThat all Web browsers understand the job of script typically stored on the server as is the HTML CSS and the data and by the way the data's usually started a data base right that things like the text the links the images those are stored in a database so you need to understand databases a little bit\nAnd if you want to get into Web design today you're probably going to be learning something called frameworks these er\nWeb frameworks that help you design a interactive pages the most one of the most popular widely used it came from Facebook it's called react\nThat the job a script framework so you'll be doing job a script but you'll be using libraries from react Twitter has its own a Google has its own\nAnd there are many languages you can use in fact you know for instance when I write Web pages I generally don't write directly in job a script because for years java scripts was a nightmare languages actually settled down quite a bit but for years it was just awful\nAnd so I Will use a tool that will be interpreted into job scripts something like closure you can do that with go or ... variety of other languages and then you don't have to write in job a script but if you but you need to understand those fundamental technology so if you and your spare time you'd like to say yeah I think it would be by the way a great skill [noise]\nUh there's there's kind of three groups of things you need to do one is that programming thing java scripts CSS HTML you need to understand those\nThe other is the database you need to understand database design how you call databases how you interact with databases 'cause that's where the content is stored and the third part\nGaming I I don't I use in you know\nSo it depends on what you're doing if you're using software that is multi core software and by the way that's not as much software as one might think it's really ... tends to be things like video and photo editing drawing programs things like photo shop ... video editing programs they're going to use multiple of course word\nProcessor doesn't care [noise] ah so it really depends surfing the Web probably doesn't care too much so it really depends on what you're doing if you if you you know intel ran into a problem which is they couldn't\nMake faster and faster chips that kinda got stalls around for ... hertz they ... they thought they were going to be able to make five and six ... chips and\nIt turned out physics to fight them\nAnd so they instead of making faster chips individual chips they made multiple core chip so\nInstead of having one forgive hurts processor they might have two processors in the same they call it die the same physical chip two processors that was the court to you by each a to point to or to point ... hertz\nUh and then they went to four they now have the ... nine processor\nAh ah with say just review the Ninety nine hundred K. which I think has eight corps and if they are getting bigger and bigger I'm as sixteen threads but that's another thing entail did which is they said well each court could do two things so we're going to say this can do sixteen things at the same time\nBut it's not quite as sixteen times faster as a single court\nAnd again this is the important thing most software only uses one of those cores if it only uses one than the most important thing to you is the clocks speed of that core not how many course there are right so a forgive hurts to courtship\nIs faster on a word processor than a to get go hurts hate courtship because the process is only using one core oh yeah right so that's why this is a complicated answer I think is what do you do what do you do with your computer\nI mainly service on the Internet but I I we usually we don't know the computer and they used to sell 'em processor [noise] yeah\nI Know you don't these days or to\nCourt to core processor always great you know but the only thing uh I Would like to get a like a assess each of their self that speed up the Buddha\nWell and that's the other important factor in this right a ... it's the truth is the AMD chips are a little less expensive and a little slower\nBut maybe if you could take the money you save and put it to some other things that would speed things up because for instance if you're doing word processing it doesn't matter how fast your computer is\nYour slower than any processor you could put in the modern computer on the other hand the speed with which you load programs load the operating system save files\nThat's more important to you so as solid state drive that is much much faster boot up times and and ... times to load programs and save files that's going to make a big difference in overall system performances a holistic thing it's not we focus way too much on the ... of the processor\nIs so many other things graphics processing unit for instance may make much more difference for you even if you're doing high end video or photos\nMay make much more of a difference to you than the the the CPU the the main corps in fact you you'd probably be better off buying a faster gp you than a slower CPU for most of the things you do [noise]\nSo it really comes down to what is your used case how you're using this processor\nUm I Would recommend reviews at the to the geeky is reviews out there are two different sites and non tech A. N. A. N. D. T. C. H. dot com and PC Perspective which is P. C. P. E. R. dot com\nPC Perspective has some well I was mentioning their harbor leader board they're high in computer that's got an empty rise and ship in it one of the thread river chips uh so\nYou know these are not bad chips by any means I don't think they save you quite enough to to make up for the\nPerformance loss but it really it you know sell you when you're talking a cellar on one of these really cheap entail ships\nThey make these just for the low end market\nBut the truth is for surfing the Web it's fine\nI you know ... you see people surfing the Web on very slow processors so it really depends on how you're using it it's a it's a complicated frankly thing and I think we pay way too much I certainly tech journalist but people geeks and general way too much attention to\nThe speed of the microprocessor the CPU that's the only one small part of the overall\nUm equation you're right going to save money get a better screen get ... get a faster hard drive get a better gp\nYou all of those things would benefit you in the long run your your benefit your\nExperience much much more [noise] oh and don't forget the ... the backup right you got a budget a little bit further back up if you're a business I Hope you've got a chunk of your budget for\nFirst data protection security and backup we see businesses all the time losing hundreds of millions of dollars\nBecause they get bit by ransomware they get shut down for weeks\nCarbon I'd is the solution they've built the premier data protection platform for business powerful server backup and replication solutions high availability solutions and what's great is\nBecause carbon I can do it all they are a single vendors solution one number to call that can save you save your business when disaster strikes eliminate gaps and your data protection reduce costly redundancies\nHave one vendor that helps simplify your environment and they're the best end and block level encryption global the duplication they work on servers that work in the cloud they work on virtual machines over two hundred operating systems applications and plus", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "San Diego", "day": "21"}
