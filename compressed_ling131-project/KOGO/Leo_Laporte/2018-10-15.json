V. C. connect the Apple TV to the Internet now your TVs connect the Apple TV and you've added Internet capability to your TV [noise] many TV's already have this uh does your TV have Netflix Ani do yeah\nI Do I we we can get on ... like ... ... ...\nOkay so it does already have Internet you might investigate if your television look in the menu and see what apps it offers you might already have a photo lab in which case you'd have to just figure out how to get photos to that photo op lots of TVs have\nSlots for photo cards for S. D. card so that'd be another way to do it requiring no Internet you copy the photos you want onto an S. D. card a little memory card on Iraq\nSlotted end of the TV you can buy if your TV doesn't have that you can buy little ad on devices that do that the only the ad on edge steak I\nYeah that's the card reader onto your TV and and a USB flash drive it really depends on the television and the capabilities of the TV but many TV's can do a slide show if you put a photo folder in that's S. D. card slaughter on the USB port again you'd have to check to make sure you do that [noise]\nAh the nice thing about the Apple TV is it will work with any TV that has an H y port\nRoku will do the same thing but it doesn't use apples a photo sharing service it you know you'd use some other one Amazon\nHas those Amazon fired TVs use Amazon photos and you could put Amazon photos in your back and put the photos in that and then have them up on your Amazon TV as well lots of ways this ah because what you want to do is very common I see my family photos as a screen saver for instance on my ...\nYeah yeah that would be great [noise]\nSo you could do that with Roku with Apple TV probably your own existing TV capabilities are there are lots of ways to do it and it's and you're right it would be great way to use those landscape photos\n[noise] excellent thank you so much pleasure\nAnd if you have an Apple TV I stopped putting my family photos on there because the a normal a default screen saver which they called Ariel is stunning\nHey have aerial photography in super slow mo ah and it just rotates through everything from the urban landscapes of Dubai to ... overhead for LAX to the lush jungles of Hawaii\nIt's kind of like that opening shot of Jurassic Park you know I almost want to play the classic park thing as they zoom down that valley but they do it's very slowly because it's a screen saver and they want to change it but they don't want to change dramatically or draws the eye so it's just beautiful and if you have your Apple TV set up with a nice big screen that's gorgeous\nHey we're at a time I um\nI hate it when that happens when you come back next week we have lots more to talk about by then I'll have a new Google phone I can talk about that thanks to

not kids but people under a certain certain youth\nUnder say uh I don't know what'd you say twenty five thirty under thirty [noise] young people maybe I don't know a twenty nine year old and a scooters constantly under twenty five [laughter] maybe maybe Eighteen and under\nA but it's a great way to get around I understand that and kids are really good at scooters 'cause they they grew up with those razor scooters my own experience with a\nRazor scooters when I got one for my son when he was a little boy and a immediately tumbled head over heels cause I hit a pothole and I'm right over the handlebars and never did that again some a little reluctant I you know I like\nSegue so far I've written a Segway no cities have segue there too expensive to scooters are fairly cheap anyway San Francisco had her hearing and decided onto a scooter companies\nSkip and scoot they said we're going to get ... permits to skip an screwed [laughter] but none of the rest is the rest of the is Graham because we know that you know what I think that makes sense cities do that with taxis\nTo right they say there's a certain number of taxis all out of town otherwise the streets to be filled with taxes will be able to get around and I think if you let any scooter company come in and you'd get there'd be ... you would never you wouldn't be able to walk anywhere 'cause it'd be scooters everywhere\nOn the ground and the wind is upset they literally went to court asking a judge for a temporary restraining order [laughter] [laughter] this is what happens you know if you've got rubber money behind you base [laughter]\nA judge runner okay to be about because so skip and schools are go by the way the\nJudge said no no it's not the court denied mine it's requests for temporary restraining order permits are issuing a tomorrow on Monday\nThe San Francisco metropolitan transit is ah the agency is gonna is going to allow this\nAnd uh the court says we're not going to stop it San Franciscans says the S. F. MTA deserves scooter services that are safe\nEquitable and accountable [noise] it is a pilot program I mean the theory is if this all goes well maybe more scooters will be a while but anywhere where scooters are allowed to proliferate it's kinda like rabbits if there's\nOn Amazon Amazon for Bill so understand when you look at the listing you're going to see who sold by that's who's actually selling new\nBills by sometimes Amazon sometimes on\nThe report the tech [noise]\nI think in general\nFox News on the hand by FEMA director Brock Long surveying the damage and the panhandle area today caused by hurricane Michael\nGot a long way to go the hardest mission is going to be I'm not just like the same and getting thousands of people out of shelter in more suitable living conditions but ultimately there's going to be a tough one term housing mission or that lies ahead and it's going to take many months\nPresident Trump made additional disaster assistance available to the state today the death toll from hurricane Michael is estimated at Eighteen election day fast approaching how's the journey leader Kevin McCarthy predicts counts\nRepublicans will say out will fare\nI say this is going to be a battle because of the financial resources the Democrats have against us but the number of our candidates are doing very well and have gotten a bump in the last couple of weeks\nMcCarthy on Sunday Morning futures Fox News [noise]\nDo frenzies Johnny jets are traveling guy Johnny is a on a on a\nWeak line from far far away right now Hello John how you doing how's outlets out actually sounds ... sounds good you're not that far away I gather where are you\n[laughter] I'm In London england and or am I rented an apartment and I guess I'm not by the\nThe box you know my wife and son her upstairs sleep in and I didn't have the heart of kicking them out of the bed I'm downstairs trying to be quiet so you're you're on the phone as opposed to on the wife fine [noise] but I'm I'm Skype audio now I'm doing it through the computer Oh nice All right well that sounds very nice [noise]\nSo uh what brings you to London Johnny you know we're in Bermuda for the family Travel Association conference which are small conference or over the week or last week\nActually which is something I wanted to bring up real quick the keynote speaker was one of the most amazing humans I've ever seen and he really you should have him on your show because he needs your tech help\nHis name's Gordon Hartmann and actually time magazine called the place that he created where the world's one hundred greatest places I Want to get it right now what what is called ... Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio\nHis daughter has special needs and he was on vacation about Twenty years ago his is a wealthy man he ... he retired and he was on vacation with his daughter and who has special needs and she was playing in a pool with some kids\nAnd when ... when her daughter tried to play catch with the with the kids they just grab the ball and got out and he said he just couldn't take that look on her face of a disappointment\nSo he decided that there was no place in the world that had a place for people with special needs and and who don't\nTo come together so he created this water park thirty six million dollars\nIn San Antonio and it's all twelve percent of the population has special needs and America that's not a freebie Oh yes\nAnd so now when they're big they're big thing was that you know for kids who aren't electric we're in a wheelchair that's powered by either electric or battery or they have a breathing machine they could never get it wet so they had to figure out how to create\nA wheelchair that was that one hundred work wheelchair oh my God so they did it and they did it like that but by using compressed air wow and now what were they need your help is they're trying to build a camp for for ... with a zip line and their ... and there are there and they're having a hard time right now trying to figure out how they can\nDo is applying with kids in wheelchairs breathing apparatus that that is so cool\nBut you got to watch this video on creating a post right now I'm time magazine actually not time magazine time magazine named one of the world's greatest places\nBut New York times did an amazing video on it and now I'll I'll tweet it or put it in a ...\nIn the chat room but this guy is amazing he really the guys who runs for president United States [laughter] but anyway um [noise] if anyone has any advice on that that would be great advice on how to figure out how to get kids with wheelchairs up on his it line\nBy line oh that yeah well they're pretty they're pretty good because they figured out how to get them on a on a water slide wow as line\nBut you don't need to take the wheelchair on the line or do you\nI think you do so you want to share with them yeah that's interesting very oh so what have you heard of that out then it's such a neat idea Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio Texas for I just want it in a magazine\nAnd then you got to look at the New York Times' video but anyway um so then because we're so close to London six hour flight we came over here to see now at least family I just that I can I can work anywhere I Am I'm fortunate\nI'm so he flew British Airways if a nonstop flight six hours or only sixty five people on our triple seven to ...\nAnd love it because then you could spread out a fire in the face on roe [laughter] yeah basically he did to us and um [noise] so anyway here's another website for you is is\nUm if you want to be treated like a celebrity and I don't know if you've ever seen celebrities go through airports by see it all the time in LA\nWhen they department I transfer or when they arrive\nThey just get whisked through and so now I figured out how they do it a company approached me and they said try it out and then it's called um black lane pass black Elaine pass so black way I talked about them before because they do a car service real good car service but now\nThey have this past where they do in five hundred airports worldwide they will scorched you so it was perfect for my mother in law 'cause my mother in law was meeting us in London but she was flying into Heathrow were planning to get wick and she's a little bit of a nervous traveler so I arranged for her to be\nFor a hundred dollars someone was waiting the moments he stepped off the plane so are you going website leader but you don't have to sign up ahead of time no we're now clear is different clears for um security in certain airports\nThis is so when she landed in London literally when they open up the door there was a there was a person they're holding a sign with her name but they grab their bags they walk through they cut the line for on immigration so she'd have to wait an hour in immigration lines I\nDo that I think they got to deal with the costs they had to order exactly wow and then they get your bags\nAnd then they go through customs\nAnd then you get they put you in a car if you order a car you can order carpet black lane already where wherever you could whatever transportation you want you can take a bus but they'll put you on there and she was like when we arrived she's like that was the best thing ever because I've been ... I'd never felt like this\nAgain so it's perfect for people who are either nervous or business travelers who don't want to\nI Would do this for my mom does not want to fly says eighty five years old she doesn't want to fly and her real fears that confusion once you're on the plane it's minus the confusion getting on and off she's you know she's really getting washed or whatever so this would be a great thing\nWhat a couple of years ago I had my dad fly from LA he met me in Budapest and he had to go LA London Budapest\nAnd I wish this was a failed or I knew about it because I was so worried about him getting long lunch and yeah and yeah I I Love and he wrote might get lost in Heathrow it's a nightmare [noise] yes and um so anyway this is a perfect thing for business travelers for families it's each", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "San Diego", "day": "15"}
