I'm not planning to stick around a little bit longer I'm trying to move back and forth from Mexico and again\nBut I I'm In a pickle I mean I read in the house and home and Mexico so the only thing that I have going on in my son was in college right now in the community college\nA some kind of I don't know what to do it and and the fence\nTony did you say your house is worth a million dollars yet how much equity do you have all\nOh so you have no debt on the house no okay okay yeah of course they wanted you to put the money in the in the accounting to generate some big commissions for them that's what they're looking for um I I Would say that\nYou you probably for a a a lump sum of money like that and by the way why isn't the home selling\nUm I had a free or whatever if everybody has a a a feeling in a in fact I was going and going from a great\nUm I don't know I really don't have an ... I Am you know I'm going to be out of my contract when my real or the next few days in fact on how could they get put my car I think of it goes you know come on one of the house\nSo um I have no idea they owed opinion was for dark at night and not in a big yard\nOr all kinds of ... we had offered a low and and like I say and I'm not forced to sell it I Want to sell a sure from that that's basically\nA bottom line I'm not forced to sell it for whatever reasons you know and yeah\nSo my my thinking would be Tony a couple of things are real quick number one um [noise]\nI Would spend a little bit of time right now\nMaking some decisions about what you want to do with the money when the home selves don't don't wait until the cells and then I have this giant lump sum of money sitting in front of you and then try to make a plan and uh you know ask the you know your broker what do you suggest I Do\nWith the money when we sell when I sell the home and and really have them put it in writing exactly what it would be and ask them to put it in writing and explain to you in detail what kind of fees\nYou will be charged and what kind of fees you'll have to pay for their services and for the products that they want to sell you [noise] um yeah that's really important\nYeah go ahead and do a little bit less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars that I had with them\n[noise] um and you know I just have to pay out the house I'm sure\nSo uh yeah I mean I I don't know what else to do I mean it makes sense that what you're saying obviously and and I appreciate your you know or you know I didn't actually when I look at your call a uh anchor funding and see if they're having ADS too\n[noise] yeah I mean hey there's fifty thousand dollars on a credit card debt and I want to add up to ... when I felt it how to\nOf course why not sure you should pay it off yeah that's absolutely fine don't listen there's no shortage of people out there that will give you advice about what you should do with this money but remember it's bottom line it's your money\nAnd if they have all these bright ideas about what you should do with the money then they they better put it in writing and they better explain to you all the costs that are going to be involved and what the risks are that are are are involved because of course people have their own way of doing things and um\nI Would say be careful thank you okay good luck to you Tony thanks so much for ah for calling allied okay I'm\nAll right so that's a that's going to do we only have a couple of minutes left here and we've got a a interesting week coming up we're going to see how the markets react tomorrow or tomorrow the markets will be open even though it's Columbus Day I think it used to be a holiday but I don't think\nIt will well it still is a holiday for some people I Know banks are closed and government offices are closed about government offices they'll\nClose for anything um but uh that's what what's going on right now and then we'll get to the market but the markets will be open tomorrow or the stock market will be open I think the bond market is closed\nBut be that as it may have we'll probably see some activity tomorrow in the financial markets and they were kind of just have to wait and see where things go from there we have economic news there is a a few economic reports of note coming out to\nA next week we'll have reports on inflation the consumer price index and the and the producer price index and again once again they shouldn't show any real evidence of inflation but yet there's this constant fear of of runaway inflation and\nHigher mortgage interest rates and higher interest rates everywhere out there and I remember when we started the program we talked about the the one report from a from a Bloomberg\nTalking about a bloodbath for the bond market coming up a bloodbath a bloodbath he said how dare they how dare they\nBut be that as an made us what we've got to where to live with and we're just kind of watch things as they go from here uh and uh as I say there's a few economic reports and they were going to start hearing from individual companies were going to start getting quarterly reports in for the past a quarter for the third quarter and I think we're going to get nothing but good news there\nAnd this is a market that I think is going to have a little momentum upward momentum as we move toward the end of a of two thousand and Eighteen can you believe that we're we're going to the fourth quarter already that's just amazing\nSo we'll we'll keep you posted each morning listen in ... I Know when I Do my\nMy market reports in business reports and I hope you'll uh you'll join us on a regular basis\nAll right I'm George Chamberlain as always thanks so much for being with us thanks to the people who took the time to pick up a phone and call in with our open phones and we'll be back next week we'll be back next Sunday from noon until two right here on news radio six hundred cocoa have a great day everybody\nOh KM why he sneezes San Diego live\nCynical go new center on ... for our here is the latest in what is happening in the country right now and it pertains to justice Brett Kavanaugh he is now on the Supreme Court senators who had a hand in his ascension are reacting Scott with the latest\n... vote to confirm Kavanaugh was narrowing Democrats like Senator Mazie Hirono on ABC's This week saying they fear what partisanship ... show on the high court ...\nHow it might sound vaccine arrives at a time and so I\nWent on Fox News Sunday GOP Senator Lindsey Graham says he was angered by Democrats actions in hopes voters will show that in the mid term\nI'll pay my body running for the house and these ...\n[noise]\nUm no I'm really suspicious now we have no reason is a very weak\nDenial [noise] if you use a windows tan perhaps you've heard that there's a new feature uptick coming windows ten has monthly security patches bug fixes that kind of thing they call it patch Tuesday\nIn fact Tuesday is patch Tuesday [noise] last Tuesday Microsoft said All right they had a big event to show off new hardware new surface pros and surface laptops studios and so forth and at the event they said and today we're proud to say we will begin pushing out\nThe new feature update they call it Eighteen own mind 'cause it's in the September twenty accepts October but it's close enough so that's it you know nine [noise] last one was Eighteen of three\nBut it came out in may so eight to five but I but anyway I don't pay no attention to the numbers that's not the most important thing the most boring thing is the ... you know these they do these a couple of times a year and windows to remember they said when does tend to last version of windows were not going to a ship all windows eleven\nWe're just gonna keep updating keep improving windows tan and we're going to do that to three times a year it's turned out to be really two times a year with these big feature updates\nExcept that almost immediately people started saying whoa that feature up I stole the feature update believing all my documents\nOne guy in the Microsoft support board said\n... gigabytes of documents to my documents folders\nGone oh\nThat doesn't seem like a behavior but it also seems weird because Microsoft has tested as as they have in the past with millions of people\nThe current you know eight nine has been tested for six months work there to test the next one already with these people who volunteer maybe you're one of them it's the windows insider program\nYou'd think if this thing did that except maybe the installers the last piece of the puzzle right maybe they didn't they hadn't been really testing the installer so maybe they did you know forget to tested thoroughly high on no anyway Microsoft and they have pulled back Eighteen oh God\n[laughter] so um\nYou won't be able to get a teen 'til nine if you were all excited about it probably few people have ... the way it generally works it was assumed that they Microsoft wasn't\nGoing to start kind of saying you know you know how they do that with pop ups hey there's a new version of windows one installed they until Tuesday to patch Tuesday so that people who got it where what Microsoft calls seekers I Am a seeker I'm a secret truth of wisdom end of windows updates\nAnd I got it because if you went to windows update and actively said what's that what's new anything new\nIt would say well yeah there's this new feature update you want it I installed it on at least three\nComputers by Lenovo that I have in front of me the AT T for Seventy yes last year as a laptop I installed it on a surface go the new little mini surfaced that Microsoft put out a couple of months ago I saw it on my big surface studio the on one\nNo problems as far as I Know no documents to lead [noise]\nBut to some people didn't have that problem ... unknown why hope you didn't and don't worry Microsoft is pausing they say that's the word they're not pulling it back then that withdrawing pausing\nPausing it nothing to fear here [noise] ah we had the iPhone announcement that's usually the big fall announcement right in August Samsung announced the note nine very nice phone there's another shoe to drop typically in October\nGoogle announces new stuff and yes Tuesday Google was having an event in New York City hash tag made by Google there's really no\nI think there will be no surprises here we've been looking at the Google pixels three leaks have been coming out for months\nI just wrote a review of it a review of it it isn't even announced yet apparently Hong Kong or retailer had one and sold it to an end gadget reviewer and so he's reviewed it was pretty clearly the\nYou know the real deal it's very nicely package saw in the self worth\nOr the ... nothing to see here it's nothing surprising we also I think get a new chrome or west powered they're going to call it all the leaks say pixels slight it'll be a tablet you can add a keyboard to\nA pixel book to an update to chrome cast and perhaps something people are calling the home hub home ...\nEverybody's got a home up now we live in this kind of sigh load world where um [noise] if you want to automate your home you get to choose do you want Sam something to do what you what apple to do what you what Google to do what do you want to Amazon to do it and you pick but then once you pick or you made a choice you know\nYou're you're you're in the family you're you're one of us so\nWe'll see what Google has to offer they don't really have a hub quite yet this is their chance I get the assistant right [noise] eighty eight eighty that's clear those are the big stories of the week there's more\nBut really I Know you care more about what's going on in

I Need to extend my wife fight so that I can get a\nFire sticks or something like that for the other team east right and they can uh do it but I don't know what kind of range extender I Need or if there's a better brand or main\n[noise] yeah this is\nMy thing uh uh the most out the whole thing be the wire the whole house\nBy horse but who's going to do that nobody let's go on the ... of course\nYeah I I keep I'm tempted to do that in my house in the crawl space underneath here in California we tend to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces underneath but then who wants to go under there that's even worse me addict\n[laughter] lighter so or or or worse [laughter] the cable companies\nTook advantage of the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and I remember there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital Turner and stuff the cable companies pretended that this was a requirement for them to and took advantage of and they all went digital ah I Know there's advantages for them they can\nGet more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth and just getting digital packets on there so you get more challenges cetera et cetera et cetera\nBut of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over and over and above your cable companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or you know YouTube TV or whatever\nBut they do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other TVs in the house and that can sometimes be challenged\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back room and stream some stop but there's a lot of offering\nYeah what you'll notice on why fires the farther you get the less signal you get and third I signal you get the less speed you get it's a direct correlation so\nWe want to boost the signal now uh it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point that has to do Lebanese see\nAre you here ...\nMike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent or however you sell a\nDecent why why it's not fair Sal um [noise] it's just that uh they also have the the the lock on that as well we're very we're also the only choice we had\nOh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now what I Would recommend it most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours will ... cable company but if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife fi router\nI did I did do that\nYeah okay good so you ... ... if they if they're cable modem has a wife by a part part of it you know around are part of it just disable bad or at least turn off the wife ... radio\nIf you could turn off the wife ... radio that'll eliminate signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I rather than what we called bridge mode say let the cable modem route or because they're still around her and they decide what IP address as we all get but I'm going to use you for why find that usually works pretty well\nYour best way to do this is with the more modern mesh why fire routers a hero sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be from next year a veil up from is that links as I can never remember there's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things\nAnd these mesh routers are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from all the onions and then they have sub units typically you buy a a a little subject for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kinda thing you might might buy more\nAnd and these these little extra units are are like repeaters but they're better than\nSo you can get a repeat or for your existing non mesh system but what will happen is the repeaters takes half of the time talking to the route to the base station and the other half of the time talking to you so we\nAll why fight extenders cut wife I speed in half [noise] wow that's\nThe nature of a wife I extend or because they can't operate in what we call full duplex smoke they can't they can't do two things at once they can only either talk to the route or talk to you so that's split than a half\nThe ... have a back channel this is the ... the main difference have a back channel they use to communicate with the base station it doesn't slow down so the ... and this is why it's the best solution for somebody who's trying to expand their wife I footprint\nAnd plume is another one that's uh that's I use both plume an arrow in my house there lots of companies all you have to look for ...\nUm the problem is the expense because you're not only buying a base unit you're going to buy one or two or three extra extenders in the end they usually start at three hundred dollars\nAnd uh they go up usually around a hundred hundred and fifty bucks per extender\nSo you haven't been able to face outlook probably really solve the problem and some of them are\nMost of them have additional features for instance the heroes or\nHave if you pay extra I think is a hundred bucks a year erode plus which has filtering so it keeps your kids off of bad sites has things like you could say to your echo pause a juniors why fine in his will go off um and you ... years will continue they have lots of nice features guest they have guests networks\nThey really do they have like a timer they do we have whatever she will be on all\nI forgot the password to get access to the phones because I've got so many of them and I I I just I I'm In my brain doesn't work right I'm working on probably three brain cells\nAnd losing them all the time because of lack of oxygen into my brain so a lot to make an excuse for it\nDo you don't have to make excuses and by the way everybody forgets the ... six\nSix December and that's part of my problem to the older you get the more you have problems remembering things that's bad enough but I\nDon't don't don't apologize Robert I'm catching up with you so here's here's the deal or\nIs it the thing that the code you enter when you first this you know the turn on the phone you have to honor code to get into it\nWho I okay\nSo on these older Android phones they're not quite as secure an iPhone you might be\nA little bit more a challenge because apple really locks these things down but on an Android phone or if you don't mind doing it the easiest thing is to erase it and start over do you mind doing that though I don't mind that at all\nOkay so it's going to depend on the phone but almost you know what I Will say all Android phones have a way to get into recovery mode\nNow the easiest way is of course if your phone is unlocked you can do it right from the settings but your phone is locked so what you want to do is reset it without unlocking it and you can do that but you're going to have to figure out you know inject here's the\nFirst thing I'd try it works on most Android phones you press it hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time [noise] and they'll put you in recovery\nMode and that works on almost all Android phones\nIt can't promise it'll work on yours and what you might end up having to do is Google\nYour manufacturer and model and the word reset or factory reset and there may be a different command for say the al ... cells or whatever\nBut what the what what the commander in in my case of pressing the power button\nAnd you have to kind of it might be a little tricky because you have to do it and they're you know just kind of at the same time\nAnd volume up button and you have to you said volume up and power at the same yeah and you can you hold it and then once you get ... at some point you might have to turn it off first and you could do that by even if it's locked by pressing in holding the power off button\nSo power power at all the way down then press the power and volume button together and you'll see you should see on most of these phones face a text based menu that's the recovery mode\nAnd I'll tell you how you navigate that you move the volume button up or down through the menu and then you press the power button to select and so you're going to select reset\nAnd a reset will just a race to phone take it back as if you just bought it which actually isn't a bad thing to do once in a while\nI did just buy it at all I did was get it able to commit to my wife by that I hadn't done anything else so I won't worry about losing any\nTray perfect perfect and then now some people are going to yell at me when I say this but I honestly think this is perfectly fine you don't have a lot of strangers coming and going in your house do you narrow zero\nSo it's okay it's perfectly fine to write passwords down a ... the only issue would be if somebody could get access to the notebook you're writing it it right but as long as people aren't going\nThat after you get past my three fifty seven first\nOkay that sounds pretty good\nI won't be breaking in Robert ... actually it yeah here in Florida so uh you you have you have a lot you have the stand and\nStanding cocker lawyers your great so [laughter] so what I Would do is get up get a new book I I've actually I've actually seen these in I'm In the like the targets and stuff they [laughter] this is I don't know if there's a good idea but I see no books if they pass words\nOn the front of it in gold letters that's kind of an announcement to get this no but but maybe don't have one that says passive but there's got to know book that you know and you keep it in your desk drawer\nAnd anytime you set a code a password\nWhatever just write it down okay that's your password fall\nThere was a second issue with them is they always want to keep updating just the apps that came with it right and they only have eight ...

they go for like five seven processors they're like the machines you've got a brand new but they're you know three four years old\nAnd a way with Linux you want it that way because the as machines get

e which is so about a year and a half old and we're very happy with him she's a heavy user I'm sure there's a song constantly when she's at a particular time or whatever I let my phone go down to you know\nThe last ... solo before I charge it and um because I'm not necessarily a user of hers that I couldn't go two or three days anyway um I Know apple is offering a\nTwenty nine dollar lottery replacement till the end of the year for these photos um capacity is eighty six percent mine is eighty nine percent is it worth the money to replace those batteries\nYeah I mean you're you're in pretty good shape so when the phone comes is delivered to your door it's a hundred percent capacity that means in generally it all is the Maya batteries have a certain number of charge discharge cycles they can go through generally around five hundred [noise]\nSo uh you know in a fraction of what your wife's doing a fractional charge discharge so she's letting it go down a quarter inch charging it up a quarter for those make one are you are more you know discharging fully recharging so you're going to get that five hundred times as it gets closer to that five hundred point it's going to get\nLower and lower the capacity at some point it's going to get so low that really won't hold a charge anymore and you will need a new battery apple had to do this they didn't want to do this they had to do it because they\nThey started pushing out software updates were slowing phones down with ... with their batteries were worn because they didn't want the phone to crash if there would be high demand on that battery and sometimes that does happen they say a lot of people said\nNo it doesn't happen Android doesn't do it or it's a just a ploy to get you to buy a new phone and in response apple said well All right we'll let you get a new battery if you want I think you recommend I think you're probably right I don't you know it's that's a pretty high level\nSo I should show or on ... or so but not\nA good deal [laughter] but I you know ... thirty bucks I don't think you need it\nIf it's a world don't fix it as you know the old\nYeah and how much how many more years you want to use that as the\nAs long as I can I Love it I don't\nIt will it will get it back up to a hundred or so maybe we'll add\nYou know six months to the life is is that worth thirty bucks that's the decision you have to make\nRight [noise] [noise] okay also can I comment on something you said last week\nIt's actually by the way Seventy nine dollars for the S. E. oh that'll change your point of view it as it is it depends on the phone while yes go ahead\nI'm you were talking about you know taking your cameras on vacation and all these stuff\nAll the you know ... a photographer you like to carry a lot of stuff with you and it occurred to me when I was listening to those are the show every week thank you\nUh I'm In the sixties one of the great photo journalist street photographers on research it was all I'm\nOnly used one lambs at once ... regular went anywhere man with the amazingly I mean\nHe used to like three fifty millimeter and stuff to use a thirty five\nI actually bought a like A M three because of that and and the fifty millimeter like a lens I'm almost all the great\nTalker for if you're a street photographer you carry one camera and one lens because you don't want to intimidate people and you don't have time to switch around [noise] so yeah of course and I think that's fine I think it was so creatively\nA kind of limits you exactly\nSo anything you should say that because of my last trip I bought one camera and if if the millimeter lands that was it\nWell there you go [laughter]\nAnd it I was told to do that by our photo guy Chris mark already said it's a great learning experience and it was in fact to add insult\nTo injury I was a manual focus lens so the whole point being you've got to take your time and thinking composed and plan your shot an associate with fake\nYeah instead of and we mentioned this last last hour a digital photography is essentially disposable photography 'cause it's too easy\nAnd you know there's so many choices that flake [laughter] it's like you go nuts trying to you know right all the options that they will make available you\nAlthough I don't think I'll do it at a next time I

technology that's my job Dave in Sarasota, Florida is next hello Dave [noise]\nGood afternoon or good afternoon to your credit to call for shaded by a\nTrend trying to save some money okay and written some cars 'cause we travel and we love the cochlea option that we get one last caller I. M.\nJen that awesome\nIt is I Love it and uh the challenges got is that we have to relatively recent cars that dude a costly option [noise] so I've been playing around trying to figure out how to\nUm use my iPhone to build a link to a wife and I had all I'm traveling\nOh what a clever idea you want to basically I'll take the eye pad as your is your car player yeah\nYeah that way my life I can see where the maps gone and we can do agree so much more pleasant experience and um but the problem I've got is that the maps on the eye pad even though I'm I'm\nConnected by two or something do not keep up with the travel oh it's a life\nI pet you know why that is that I had I had yeah that I had doesn't that GPS after GPS started work like that [noise]\nSo you're so you're streaming the map from the phone to the pet know\nHooking up the head of the hot spot to my\nOffice so using the ... yes so that's exactly why so um this is this is unfortunately and it's not an issue in the phone every iPhone has GPS built in\n... our parents do not unless you get one with a cellular ship in it to sell your ship as a single chip that has both radios for GPS and LT\nAnd so that's the problem precisely is that the ... the er I pat I'm fact I'm kind of impressed the I've had can kind of figure out where you are it's doing that by triangulating why fi access points and if you get out in the country where there's no why fight you won't know where you're\nFrom it's a little slow sometimes you missed the terms\nBefore you really yeah we're really in your phone is reliable 'cause it's using GPS for a pet is not okay it does\nIt does the location is actually clever a trick that ah ah apple uses Google used it was a company called sky hook that pioneered this they drove ... a lot of cars around with GPS is is that I noticed\nWhen I'm Fifteen feet from wife I access point a twelve feet from access point B and a hundred feet from Akron points see I'm here\nAnd it may literally made a map\nTriangulating all the Y in almost everywhere in the country and then selling that to Google and apple apple and Google Now do that themselves with their own cars but that's a very clever technology but it's not perfect\nA few interesting so if I bought an I tend to have the GPS ... he wouldn't\nBe a lawyer trick is your next type pet and good news apples probably coming out with I ... a month for a get one within LTV chip then you don't have to be I mean you're still going to have to pay for an out to eat connection that's a pain for a but you'll have that way you won't have to pay for it to the phone for the data and it'll have GPS will be accurate [noise]\nSounds like a solution I thought maybe I was missing something a ... year that was yeah\nTo bed at just the way it is not a problem and the reason is Israel is right ...\nThanks for the call is very simple and they did to chip that apple puts in\nProbably ... was from Qualcomm\nNowadays I guess it's from into a is a dual purpose chip does GPS and Internet\nOr and so they just don't they just don't put that and now they're going to they're going to release I'm almost certain there's lots of evidence\nThat they are going to release new I ... this year probably knew I had pros or remember that Apple's latest phones all the phones this year have a new interface they don't have a home button they don't have a fingerprint reader their face i._d.\nCandle program on it that comes generic is kind of junk what else there is season there's so many of them out\nThere really are um on on and on the\nMac or rather the iPhone I have some very strong choices like hey lied or which I really like um obscure camera obscura on Android let me look what I got out here because uh I don't think they're quite as many really nice choices are out there\nA cortex is the one that I probably most often go to instead of the built in cameras solution or it allows\nYou to do some interesting a processing\nClose including remove motion blur enhanced shadows things like that\nSound it made it in a million and blurred especially yeah because it's very easy I logged in there all these little ... [laughter]\nYeah exactly and and uh what camera phones will do without telling you\nIs a is a ... they'll in order to gather more light\nThey'll open it up or they'll slow down the shutter speed and you won't even know you're going to get blurry pictures until you look at 'em and go wait a minute those are all blurry yeah they don't really warn you so cortex is a good one [noise] um actually I'm a I'm going to ask the chat\nRoom or if they have any camera recommendations for Android I actually use the uh on the Samsung I now I replaced my ass nine with another nine actually use the Samsung up what is it too complicated to many widgets is that what bothers you\nJust like too much stuff there I just want something that will take\nThese photos without the having the constant motion blur and if I take a photo outside it doesn't and it ... it says a little bit too dark all actually use the flash automatically inside turn it off it says\nThat I get a dark stole don't look for ... yeah so that's the reason I watched that China will listen you know you use the light that's there um and ah you know we'll get rid of the most simply that that's the biggest thing is a little simpler that's what we'll\nTry try that then uh cortex and then another one that I've used for years and I haven't tried lately is a camera F the five it has a lot of manual control they may not be you know they do have a light version you can try for free it may be a little bit more um fussy\nThan you want if you don't want fussy and as I did this go is still around via CEO ... for a long time was the best camera out there I get another one I haven't used and walk I pretty much stick to\nThe same son camera or on the pixel fund the Google Camera and then and then cortex if I Need ... yeah cortex Kim yeah also thank you ... there's a couple of good choices for you and if we anybody has a suggestion I'd love to hear from you know you\nCan either call eighty eight eighty eight ethically although we're in the waning moments of the show so you might want to go to the website tech guy labs\nDot com and you can leave your suggestion in a in the comments\nFrom lots of lots of good listeners out there no a lot of stuff I think if the five I Would try um I I I I Would certainly tribes scared but I I haven't been less motivated to try third party camera apps lately because I think they just do a great job with the Samsung up\nMy only complaint is is that there's way too much stuff in it\n[laughter] there's lots of filters and [noise] you know beauty filters things for ... you know self ... and stuff that I just I just don't you just don't use a show that they brought you out by our friends have remote PC remote access is uh maybe something you never thought about but I can bet you
