cocoa eight hundred six hundred five six for six at called him on Twitter and Facebook a\nErica lakeside your thoughts on the president's comment about it being a scary time for men is this a offensive to you as a woman\nI honestly I I agree with him on different um let it go\nOn and for me I feel like men and power are that you know I didn't want her getting called out on and but her winning you know it's so easy for them to men now in days like whether they're in power or the guy at a grocery store\nYou know and it can go one way and that guy can feel in danger and the women have only from hearing [noise]\nSo how do we deal with this as a country I mean you know this I'm sympathetic to the me too movement because uh you guys have been pigs people in power have been pinkish\nUh including went and there's been some women that have taken advantage of that one actress I Can't remember her name right now but um [noise] uh she she took advantage of this a kid um uh\nSo we can go both ways but um we know that there are unsubstantiated um false allegations made a it's all too easy in this environment so how do we how do we reconcile\nI guess mine I have no idea but I got a question for you though go ahead I'm\nWhen one thing that you know men and and I know are in danger you think in that light all and then in general or like men that are in power or are well known [noise]\nI think he means all ... men in general are are are potentially facing a unsubstantiated allegations I think that he's brought in his commentary are you on a plane again make sure the President Trump is only eleven seconds listening Erica [noise]\n\nThere's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very difficult times\nSo I just played it and a bike just reminded me that caller's can't hear my audio but anyway he said it's very scary time for young men in America a you know even if you're you're choose to something that you're not guilty of ah so I think you know he he specifically said young men or does that\nDoes that ring true to you that you got a young man what does a young man mean in in ... dirty old man you know could be a sexual harassed her but\nYoung men or they just goofing around or the horse playing or they just uh selling their wild oats I I still don't think the best acceptable if a kid takes a knife out of a out of the drawer and stabbed ya you still say what you did was wrong and I think that if a\nA teenager commit sexual assault or rape it's still wrong okay and then they think that they should know about that\nYeah and I don't think that women you know part of the year you know whether in word or you know some random woman you know random man definitely regardless if you're not in that area [noise] I'm\nPretty sure you're going in Erica I'm Eric ... says that she does agree with the president\nBut it does both good does go both weigh\nA now berry has a slight disagreement he says he agrees to a certain extent what do you mean\nBarrel go ahead you're on air\nI thank you for taking my call\nI Would call and I have two sons that are in their thirties in their twenties early thirties and a father I feel as though\n\nAh the allegation includes\nQuote Kavanaugh kiss me forcefully I told them I only wanted to write home\nOr Kevin I'll continue to grow meet over my clothes\nAh [laughter]\nI I don't understand this the accuser said that at the same time as Kavanaugh was trying to grow per another boy in the backseat covered her mouth so she would not be able to scream\nAccording to the accuser she says that she's a teacher Who's Afraid to come forward because of the potential impact to her and her family she had been attending a party with a friend who left with a different boy leaving her to find her way home on her own she had been drinking at the gathering\nLetter was marked urgent across the globe\nIt includes an explanation for why the alleged rape was not reported she said times were different at the\n[noise] true\nJust because you wrote a letter lady doesn't mean it's true either\nCan given the the preponderance of all the allegations that have been made against Kavanaugh that are not substantiated and falling apart\n\nA spokeswoman for Kamala Harris his office here in San Diego said quote as soon as our office received a letter we turn it over the chairman's office and to the FBI which is standard practice\nThe staffers said that the call is not part of the FBI background investigation because the allegations were outside the FBI background investigation\nThey did want to question Kavanaugh and get him a on record under oath [noise] your thoughts eight hundred six hundred cocoa eight hundred six hundred five six for six Brian\nIn the in San Diego Brian what is your take [noise]\nThey stick my yep I'm Talking about why she she works for a company and I I work for myself and

your way she could still ruin you even for no reason with no evidence don't do anything she can just ruin you\nKnow no doubt about it if if someone does something wrong all they have to do is turn around and make an accusation remember in my case ah my my false accusation the guy that went to jail and finally\nGot caught and had to admit that he was lying [noise] um [noise] my accuser made up to the allegation after he broke into the campaign office and was caught breaking in and caught with stolen goods bats when he made the accusation up so I ... it can happen to anyone\nIf so what has an axe to grind or if someone is caught doing something bad their fallback is oh without a victim of sexual harassment\nOr you try to terminate someone in today's business world and you might have wonderful cause you might have all the evidence that there are bad employee that they've done something wrong they've done a you know they've been in subordinate it you absolutely justified in firing them if they turn around and say I'm going to choose your sexual harassment gimme settlement\nA lot of companies are paying it out because they don't want to deal with the controversy\nCliche calling in uh Brian let's go to Jamie in San Diego Jamie or is it Jaime\nJamie Jamie go ahead you got to floor\nDid not go that way which is why didn't name\nRight go ahead doesn't matter if it is or not known about\nA career or young white male who have been given ... from a rare when they have actually done a lot of the I mean there were a lot of also angry coming out of that like if you're young white man we don't want to ruin your um\nYour butt you harm other women\nWait wait don't tell me about the three or four men are young boys ... they've\nBeen in the thing where the court and we don't want to ruin or future who you're talking on a walk on the Richter through in California I Believe there's one in Washington or all our number one\nBattle you're talking about the stand for kids that the judge let off with a light sentences that correct you're correct\nYou but I was one of the most forceful people against that I think the judge or should have been recalled or I think it was outrageous and then there was a you know another case across the country of that I don't agree with that if someone is caught doing it you don't give them a lighter sentence you make an example of them so other boys don't engage in that behavior\nKnow where to want to go to Kevin all because of two reasons or three reasons stand on the Fourth Amendment it very we\nHear a gift and about the president not being able to commit crimes basically partying with it that the president is pretty much um you know and then the third one is thirty pandering to the religious right where are you saying basically um\nWhere control like abortion\nI I ... and those are legitimate concerns that have about him um but I I I think the irony here is that you said the concern about him on the Fourth Amendment which is due process do you think happened I was getting due process from the U.S Senate\nWeek because of the ruins\nI Know I Know I Know I Know you say these week but do you think the Democrats on the U.S Senate committee or giving him his Fourth Amendment rights in his due process absolutely not\nOkay uh that's all I wanted to review but those other issues you raised are legitimate you can ... I think those are proper issues to raise a you might not have the votes but it they're legitimate terrain and we can have a debate about him a smear against the guy without some say education\nThat's not fair because you're calling and coming up uh we do have to talk about the allegation from ... what was your name a sweat Nick the sweating that girl who said that gang rapes are happening did you see the interview on MSNBC and NBC nightly news it's falling apart and I got to go through step by step you're going to love\nThe sort of a treatment we are going to do on her allegations because it proves just how false the accusations have been to date on the report first traffic\nFrom the SPCA the biggest used car sales traffic center eastern fifty she let south on his cancer transition dairies and crashes middle lanes block traffic is accepted ... north on the scene before market and accidents there has to traffic backing up to\nFive south down his seat before university has tracked share has traffic backed up the Adams sounds fun science slow and go up to the tissue for with a forty six and it can mean I'm Laura came because of his next real time traffic update is that for all three\nOkay so San Diego pools did my pool project at my home and I am so thrilled with the outcome you know when you build a pool is an investment in your property and it's your dream it's what you work hard for and you want that waste is in your backyard\nOr you want to make sure that you work with a pool company that's going to get it right but they're not going to shake you down give you a low ball price up front and then suddenly turn around and say oh sorry here's ten thousand there's another twenty thousand years fourteen thousand\nMore in costs busting the budget\nThat was San Diego pools they get they go was fixed price a pricing and they are honest directing sincere about the pros and cons of every element of the the pool they want you to be thrilled with the outcome they service their pools they stand behind the quality of the qualities impeccable and the pricing you well you can't beat it\nCheck them out right now they've got it all in price for a pool and spa only fifty two thousand you might say well that's a lot of money Carl it's an investment\nBut I can tell you given the pool marketing the bull market right now it's an exceptional price but it ends on October tenth so contact them do a free consultation and get a free design San Diego pools dot com San Diego pools dot com [noise] they're added again\nCan get another attempt to add more government bureaucracy and healthcare and all this time of proposition ... and who is behind date one labor unions trying to impose new government bureaucracy on every medical dialysis clinic in California is a complete abuse ... system\nAnd even worse it puts bureaucracy between patients and their doctors and prompt me for sale is clinics to cut back services or shut down sending thousands of sick patients into already crowded neon rooms experts warn ... cost taxpayers hungry it's a\nHuge savings I knew and previously least furnishings mouth writes huge savings and our financial plans that are just a wide variety of new and previously in these furniture and they are for your home run off you'll find cells from one Ninety nine Ninety nine analyze everything in our nine thousand square foot shell run by guaranteed and in fact many hard to take 'em today\nThat are handling cars furniture than center at one\nMillions of dollars joined groups representing doctors nurses and taxpayer advocates voting no on any stop this costly dialysis proposition paid for by no one proposition stopped a dangerous analysis composition by the California emails is council committee major funding from the\nSeason for sending his medical care in North America\nOh\nI Want to see a movie what's playing well let me kept with my movie is ... ... what\nI can get you went to an action flicks Sunday and I am twenty miles away but a great neighborhood we wanted to see a rom com now this movie's got great bounce you'll have you I was the paperwork my commission is totally reasonable\nYour commission real estate agents don't make sense the really after dust released a I powered cars backed up with license experts to help you buy or sell your home best part you get paid the commission download really an R.
