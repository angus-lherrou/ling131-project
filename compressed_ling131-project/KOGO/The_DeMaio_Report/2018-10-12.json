no vote now just for full disclosure I'm a yes vote on prop eleven [noise]\nUm did you take the time to check out his validity and inform the public thank you and says dear friends this is a difficult a letter to write it's political concerns proper eleven on the California ballot many you've heard the commercials that speaker paramedics and emergency medical technicians\nStaying on call during
