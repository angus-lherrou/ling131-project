election guide dot org San Diego election guide\nDot org ah we're talking next about prop ten\nAnd I've talked about this one before uh it's right in control or it would allow for localities across the state of California to more easily impose restrictions on what people can charge for apartments\nAnd renting homes are the folks that support\nThis say it's going to lead to more affordable housing well there\nAre a lot of folks saying no it's going to actually increase the cost of housing one of those individuals is a mark Powell he's with the San Diego association of realtors use\nI'm obviously a realtor with Powell brothers realty thanks so much for stopping by mark\nYou're welcome Karl so let's\nStart out why or why is Brent ... rent control going\nTo hurt 'em uh the various folks that are proponents say it's supposed to help\n[noise] well in ... where let's say for example you have it in your that um maybe is living in a house have owned it for thirty five forty years and they no longer can maintain that property and they decide that they want to read their property and move into an assisted living facility\nAnd living in the days are far more expensive\nThan the ... that they could possibly get and if there's an troll on rent or the amount of money they can actually read it for me actually trap a senior and just staying in their own health without any of that additional care that they need and depend on\nOh that's an interesting argument I haven't I haven't heard that one before because apparently rent control does not apply to assisted living facilities but it certainly does to the homes\n[noise] the funny thing about Rick controlling this proposition that's misleading that the proponents trying to tell us is that California does have rent control San Francisco I'm about Seventy five percent of their unit under rent control and what they're saying is Rick Hall is going to help with affordable housing and the homelessness\nBut as you can see 'em it didn't do that great of a job in San Francisco\nNo didn't in fact is the highest prices there and people are not willing to invest and be landlords isn't that really the the the the big impact here we know that housing prices are driven by supply and demand are we're not building enough supply demand continues to stay the same or actually increase\nAs a result as a result\nWe're having a massive increases in the cost of a purchase of homes as well as a rent so doesn't rent control actually have the counter effect of taking a apartments are in units for rent off the market\nWell yes it does and look let me share that with your car is no doubt that rent or really high in San Diego and and I can I I feel for the people that are renting it tough\nBut you don't blame the landlord\nThey didn't they didn't causes housing shortage caught it in government because of their over zealous ... permit process and their taxes and now the same government that caused the problem it wants to find the illusion it's ridiculous to let somebody solve the problem they created\nGoing out and recording the president unbeknownst to him so that they can then invoked the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policy is in place done and finished I mean that's what happened here\nYou have certain all these things are again being being paid for by the tax payer and work basically taking it in the rear end every time they do this\nAll true there's and unfortunately\nYou know when I say this is the biggest abuse of power scandal\nCorruption in American history I Am a thousand percent right and we still haven't gotten it right there was a reason Rod Rosenstein does not wanna testify have the information recorded or do it under oath because he knows he's up to his eyeballs and every aspect of all the ...\nAnd yet he's the guy that has all the power I mean it's amazing isn't the literally the well the eye of the hurricane of your well\nAll right ... thank you appreciate it I'm let us go to James in Cleveland James how are you glad you called\nI Am fantastic Sean thank you for asking um first of all like to give my thoughts and prayers and everybody on the coast going through the times down there\nHopefully uh everybody to the right thing in places shape and got other wireless shape but the reason I called actually is because I wanted to tell you that uh I was a member Trump back in two thousand six Jean and I'm completely changed my whole point of view on that\nI didn't think he was electable and I didn't think was conservative back then and I was wrong in fact I lost a hundred dollar but with a fellow actually mine over it paid him up the next day\nBut pretty much since day one I have been defending his actions are the prisoners in a fantastic job here to help my family myself so much I remember three things in my entire life\nI've noticed that the federal government actually do for me first was the Bush tax cuts and now this fabulous cut from the G European Trump this time around as so much money my pocket you know the other thing that affected me\nWas when my kind of like planning was canceled because ISI and Obama parents costs me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company dumped are Cadillac plan where I don't think you know grounds for that and things you Republicans for more money in my pocket\nYou know I'm Glad you said all of that because there are a lot of people out there that are still the never Trump or land and they won't recognize it look I can understand that they don't like the president's style\nOr it may be that there is at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue that he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over rhetoric any day\nAnd ah I Wish some of the other people that were in your camp would would be as electrically honest\nOr as you are and I applaud you for doing so ah and I'm Glad you're doing well I'm Glad your family's doing

Feinstein is kind of old\nFeinstein is a little bit more acceptable policy wise than a daily il neither is fully accepted or even remotely acceptable um\nBut I worry about daily on disability a in a shameful approach to a drive narratives and you'll be there for a long time because he's relatively young\nAre your thoughts because I've heard from many of you and you said car all we need to strategically vote\nAgainst dined Feinstein for daily on\nTo send a message to to make an example of her that's what I'm hearing from a lot of Republicans good Republicans are who never expected they would ever vote in this race uh they they were gonna leave the ... the ballot blank like I'm going to do\nA backroom deals like the high speed rail they already got millions of dollars I mean seriously DEA really need to take a take a vacation lady and take Ruth bitter bitter bitter Ginsburg with ya\nWell I don't really care what I Want I Want to\nEver go to the wild man who\nOkay thanks for calling in let's go to Chris in alcohol and he's got an idea as to why we should vote for daily own Chris you got the floor\nYeah I'm just wondering if maybe getting a this guy call on my ... in Washington D.

those are two good reasons for says get them out of California um and maybe you can do less damage well let me just point out that it daily on loses this election he's already termed out as a state senator at the at the state level so he would be going back in ... you'd have to get a real job in the private sector oh my God what is he going to do\nOr he'll just go get a job in government or for some labor union he's already given them enough favors um [noise]\nBut uh you know so I Would prefer to the to have him on the un quote unquote unemployment line or at least a working for the unions um uh on their dime rather than on our dime I'm ... but you raise an interesting point sometimes you got to show the crazy\nUm before Americans will will wake up\nUm I don't think we need daily own to add to the crazy quota or we got that we got that in spades where are we talking about that a little bit more at four o'clock because there are some people who are now starting to ... be concerned\nThat people like Maxine Waters and uh even things that Hillary Clinton said in an interview and the last twenty four hours may be inciting violence\nI I think we have more than enough crazy out there you got Pocahontas you got a Spartacus uh okay yeah Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas um ah the Cory Booker Spartacus\nA look the two of them do of them are in that moniker because they decided
