someone it's it's these are political votes\nImpeachments a political process or the trial and the sun it is a political process as much as we would hope that they would just simply follow facts and and then findings and high crimes and misdemeanors uh individuals can be impeached for anything\nCan be removed from office now it's customary that you're not allowed to impeach someone for something but they did outside of the scope of their actual performance of their duties in this case under the letter of the law\nEven if Kavanaugh were found to have done things had nothing to do with his
