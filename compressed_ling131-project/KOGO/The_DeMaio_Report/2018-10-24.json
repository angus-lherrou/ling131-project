M. E. R. E. R. nurses it's all about EMTs and paramedics do medical response the big thing we need to focus on is an emergency fire response core\nIn the state of California and other western states that literally are like volunteers that are called up like the military who are trained in wildland fire management we haven't seen that yet because the unions are too powerful amongst the firefighters that would show me that we are really making progress on fire preparedness skill in the last one\nSize five stories you're talking about numbers\nBut we first told you about this story a few days ago and now a local law enforcement terrorism task forces investigating a campaign of hate aimed at a pastoral associate at St John the evangelists Catholic Church in university heights here in San Diego Kevin ac raised a spokesperson for the Catholic dioceses have said the get go this is what he told his today\nThey're nothing ... or ... people that are very beer ago ... and ... and ...\nThere was a pastoral associated the church is gay and for some reason he was targeted by a group\nMotivated by hatred according to the diagnosis so the L. J. P. T. Q. humidity and for some reason directed at him now he says despite the death threats of despite his resignation was church he plans to keep attending the church for now and continue on [noise]\nUh I I is something about this doesn't smell right [noise] um can't San Diego is so pro Elgin beauty the Catholic Church has had no big issue with the algae beauty so something about this cliff doesn't seem to make sense right now\nA hate crimes attacks\nSomething tells me there's something else happening here um and I'd like to see an investigation if it did happen I Will be damned surprised if it didn't happen if it's kind of made up as a way to kind of leave because there's some other issues going on then I Want to know about that too\nHe says that his tires were slashed ... says that\nFire was thrown at church doors office was broken into pays for pay a spray painted with the gay slur now tires being slashed in San Diego crimes going up fire beans rode the church doors yep crime is going up going to be a homeless person probably\nOffice being broken into crime is going up now the gay slur that makes me concerned but\nIt doesn't mean that was targeted at him I I'd like to know what really is going on here\nAnd for him to resign uh I don't necessarily think that that's the appropriate approach it's hey where's the church if this is really happening the church should step up and say hey we don't allow them or should be investigated and this man should be provided with some sort of a you know protection security\nSo I'd love to see a couple more days of news cycle on this

personal\nBest friend and and\nThat's it it's it again\nYeah Brazil you call an eight hundred six hundred Togo I still think ... is a Democrat or operative under orders from someone higher up to basically make this go away make the the whole mob mentality go away because they were hurting yesterday I told you why Democrats weren't doing better in the polls\nAll right so that's the theory and I think their their their banking on not getting caught thanks so much and thanks for coming out here for probably six\nOr so and that that's the only a feedback I've gotten on that front I've got a Jason Joe one she emails me saying\nI agree it was a Clinton job I Will bet you none of those bombs or actually even capable of exploding just bomb making material no detonator is just to set up Republican\nSo some are saying\nAfter Democrats have been basically you know skewered\nThe past several weeks over my boy tactics too convenient that this suddenly kind of comes around and buy them on the rear end someone targets that Democrats and the addict and the complexity of finding\nAddresses I still think it's pretty hard to find all those dresses and then on top of that um it's clearly Democrats because they're not really wanting to hurt the Democrats are just trying to set this up and have the optics eight hundred six hundred and ... what do you think eight hundred six hundred and five six for sex we're not really going to downtown investigation's complete\nOpposite that also\nIs the um the uh the angle here isn't it we only have a less than two weeks in the election [noise]\nI don't know if the FBI is going to come up with\nThe uh the suspect in the short period of time\nThomas e mails me [noise]\nWho's responsible\nIf the FBI can't find out on the week that has to be the ... GOP in the eye of the voters\nSo I don't know but Democrats will be in control the Congress ha ha ha ha that's a very good point timing also could be an example of why this might be an inside job with the Democrats [noise]\nAgain I don't [noise] thank you very much\nAs we wanted to buy that someone just walked by with a big stack of proposition ... uh you got you got so many people out there talking about this even\nEarlier today some people got spoof here in San Diego and that's where I was driving a we're on the bus driving from Bakersfield to ah Orange County we got word that the union Tribune building was under shutdown lockdown evacuation\nAnd uh people in the office of senator Kamala Harris\nThey were also a evacuating I thought uh the union Tribune why would someone would be targeting them I mean really [noise]\nUh but my first my first reaction was why them but then it was oh come on it's got to be nothing more than some homeless person um affects because after all we are the homeless capital of Southern California\nAfter all we are in a Hoover vow or or what would I like to call Faulkner Val I'm with all of these homeless individuals on the streets and sure enough the packages or you're a busy street downtown that prompted the evacuations\n[noise] yep they contained children's books a football shoes and an empty potato chip bag\nProbably the effects of a homeless person [noise]\nHow we're\nSpending ...\nYet Kamala Harris who hasn't done squat on the homeless issue you got the union Japan that continues to kind of stroke the politicians of the city without really holding them accountable and they get all scared because oh guess what homeless or individual left the packages in the middle of the street [noise]\nLet's go to a Jose in Tampa Jose says it's definitely the Democrats Jose why [noise]\nAnd my comment was it was a Republican [laughter] it wouldn't come out on dates back\nYou could be an FBI profile or file or my friend I think well you know it's not it's not a liberal because uh they were very very uh uh excessive I'm Sorry it it must be a liberal because they can't be fiscally conservative if they wasted that much on postage\nIt might be a postal employee maybe maybe they gotta exactly right ... you calling in it that it all boils down to the voice postage according to Jose\nReal quick John where do you come down on it Don in San Diego [noise]\nYeah you're on their dog\nAnd a girl I mean again thank you for your your protect a point that we could go either way but\nMy show with that I Want to go either way\nFriends Republican or a bomb going off a really wanted to buy you a\nBut to Oregon I mean this is\nThis is what what type of things that went on to come in with\nWhat [noise] [noise]\nYeah yeah I I totally agree that's why I'm leaning towards the Democrats I'd appreciate your calling in [noise]\nWhat we're going to be able to solve it we can speculate\nOr we're going to talk about at five o'clock the fact that the media is doing a whole bunch of speculating on this in fact we've got the audio of the exact moment that CNN was evacuated\nAnd wait till you hear what some of their on air commentators had to say as well as the president of CNN blaming it all on Republicans no surprise there\nThat's at least I'm open to it being the other side and I've laid out the potential for mean both sides and asked you where he thought it was coming from no not at CNN CNN at some fringe Republican pressure\nComing up though we got to shift gears yesterday open up Pandora's box when I suggested that John Cox his campaign is a dumpster fire and then he really needs to pick up the pace and do a much better job in these last two weeks to win this race for governor that's coming up on

in the last Seventy two hours of a campaign [noise]\nSo there's still time but I Will say it's not looking good [noise]\nThe three reasons why number one I did not think that John Cox um [noise] I don't think that John Cox has been as genuine and approachable as a candidate as he needs to he's been two steps\nHe's not taking questions from the media\nHe has not had an opportunity or or given himself an opportunity to go out and really be seen as a\nNormal California He's kind of stuff\nUm and I want someone who's going to be out there and connecting and resonating number two he hasn't raised a lot of money and this is a challenge because it's chicken and egg if you don't have a whole lot of momentum in the polls you don't get the money but if you don't have the money you're not going to get the momentum in the ... [noise]\nBut for the fact that John Cox is a multi millionaire [noise] you know he said he's a businessman he's got money you spend what it takes I just don't think that the message has gotten out there in an effective way which is my third point\nJohn Cox needs to take a page from ... Donald Trump not some of the spicy stuff no no no no\nBut I mean the creative\nUh I'm going to get my message across that let me just say it's not just Donald Trump I've seen some candidates run some pretty effective ads out there who are you know congressional candidate state assembly candidates and I look at the ad and I'm like wow and it gets national attention\nRemember that a candidate on the left\nI think that he uh he kissed his partner or proposed was murder on air I don't remember what it was or how about the other one who sang a song is is a Democrat running against Barbara Comstock a and he sang a song from top gun\nAnd it was you never uh [noise] you know that this all you'd ever look that way anymore when I bought blah blah I don't know what it is but I saw the ad\nUm when he was saying is you don't hold town halls and all you don't hold ... town halls and what what is it [noise] you lost that loving feeling yes okay we're out here at the prospects of and of course of the crowd years is is is more up to speed on pop culture than I Am\nA as a San Diego and I should know about the uh you know top gun much better but anyway\nYou've lost that love and feeling and it was what he did was he he was so corny as a singer this congressional candidate but he had was brilliant ad was brilliant\nSo again John Cox doesn't have to be down from to be creative and get his message across but I haven't seen that message creativity that frankly you need in a state that so one sided with the media's so left and where frankly\nYou know all the money's on the side of of of Gavin Newsom\nDo you disagree with me [noise] do you think John God's is really a great campaign I'd like to hear from you because maybe I'm missing something again I consider John a friend he's a good guy he's a really good guy make a great governor\nAnd infinitely better than having to do something\nWe got to get them they're\nComing up your thoughts on the John Cox campaign for governor eight hundred six hundred Togo eight hundred six hundred and five six for sex\nA plus a remember that Supreme Court decision that is supposed to allow people to opt out of union membership and lower the amount of money that they have for politics and may not be working as well as you thought that's what I was in my report for ...\nFrom the San Diego county credit union traffic center\nThat accident on the east on Seventy that Nordal has cleared that traffic is crawling along it's taken more West I'm Seventy eight slow from the fifteenth Nord all really slow\nJoined on Fifteen before Miramar road there is a crash there that has just clear traffic stop and go from the ...

you regard so\nEarlier this summer a major Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me five\nFour decision said that well government workers are not forced into unions anymore they can opt out which means that they don't have to pay into the political fun however injustice\nFirst sixty days since the ruling\nThe unions in California actually added three hundred workers to their rank and file employees that they represent their now at a one hundred and thirty four hundred and thirty one thousand four hundred and ten paying union members in California from one hundred and thirty two hundred and thirty one one or two in June\nSo joining me on the director of what is the guy that started this whole thing\nMark Janet he was the plaintiffs in this landmark\nSupreme Court decision mark thanks so much for stopping by\nJake thank you I'm Glad to be here\nSo are you surprised that a even after the decision we have a more union members in California in the first sixty days under this new decision than before [noise] not\nReally um because of the rhetoric that the kids are using which in many cases is totally faults um you\nKnow there was any members that that they weren't\nAttacked if they weren't represented by their union boss well\nThat's part of it but but it has more to do with the fact that there are many many of the union people that don't know that they don't have to be a member of union anymore\nI'm and primarily the fair share or agency the players don't have to pay that agency fee which in my particular case of Illinois was eighty percent of what full union dues are so um\nWhat you're finding is that the unions are saying well you know if you're not a member of the union are going to lose your health care was totally fault because the state uh or the employer provided health care not union so they're not going to lose it they're saying well if you don't\nBe a member of the union are going to lose your um your pension let's falls again because the pension is put forth by the employer not union and I could go on and on but I think you're right the ideas will be the best information you know that the unions are putting out\nIs is basically confusing you know the people the public sector workers\nAnd because of that confusion they're thinking oh I I I should become a member because you know this was the case but here's what you have to ... on a daily basis unions a California poll Anna ... like to point three million dollars a day in union dues in fees\nAnd they basically I'm a a a money printing press\nExactly exactly you know and at one of the

truth here's what you can do as a member you make up your own mind\nHowever on the day of my decision back in June you know we had a and I can't remember the bill number but it basically said that any
