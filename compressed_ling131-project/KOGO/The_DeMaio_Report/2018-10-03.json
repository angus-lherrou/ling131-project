Nineteen nineties has come forward and the last twenty four hours to make a bombshell allegation against Dr Ford\nHere's what basically it it it consists of\nFord during her a lead up to testimony her lawyers\nUse me her lawyers made a big deal out of the fact that she passed a polygraph test that we did not be we did not get to see um the full exam we did not get to see videos of the exam which is important because you have to see how did she responded she pass it on the first try or was it the attempt to try\nA coaching her at length on how to pass a polygraph a polygraph test ever she's a psychologist\nShe studied this stuff she even are actually played up that a skill set a when she talked about the\nUm uh the way the brain remembers certain things and people said see you see the doctors you know they're just talking about she also would never try to lie to invade a polygraph test like she doesn't even know that stuff\n[noise] uh actually she does now that another element of her a comment that the ex boyfriend is shining a light on and again he says he thinks that um she's probably telling the truth about capital to put that in perspective um\nShe said she had a a a great fear of flying and that's why she couldn't come to the Senate and she couldn't testifying in a timely manner and that's why they dragged it out\nWell um she was questioned about other flights and she said oh I reluctantly took those flights now mind you they were in a\nRomantic relationship and living together from Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety eight the ex boyfriend he said he never once had her talk about having a fear of flying and\nShe flew a lot with him without complaint without reservation\nUh sounds like we're getting pretty damn close to perjury at this point now where Republicans are saying but I mean Democrats are saying Bud Light too about the level of drinking\nOh he didn't he literally said when I grew up I liked beer I drink beer I still drink beer I Do like beer I drink too much at times yes\nDo I regret yes but I didn't do what she said I did he wasn't a very ... about drinking beer\nNow what they're trying to say is oh he's such a drunk he throws

I agree with you on on Capitol that everyone should be presumed innocent\nAnd that the burden of proof is on the accuser I said okay and then the next question was well why are you better get on Duncan Hunter he deserves his day in court\nAnd my response was and I don't know if you you think of Iraq are on this one Jason my response was an ... and I think it's pretty damn simple\nKavanaugh was accused but there was no evidence provided to back up the accusation would you agree with that Jason\nYeah OK hunter was accused but we have a forty seven page indictment and we can read it and\nI read it and I know some of the people involved in it and gave testimony\nAnd not only do they have the credit card transactions not only do they have the bunny rabbit that flew across country not only do they have the testimony of the ... campaign treasure saying I warned him not to do this he did it anyway\nNot only does does it show that he lied on his campaign forms as to what the transactions were about the FBI said when he said it was this was actually that\nUm all these things are in that indictment and it's not in dispute he's just saying it's a bookkeeping air at this point Jason I'm actually as a member of the jury and the jury being not a criminal trial but the jury in public opinion\nI I I've seen enough substantiate ... he's guilty as sin and so therefore I you know I might end up holding my nose and supporting him because I Know that he's going to go to jail and we're gonna have a new election uh and I think his opponent actually doesn't fit the district but that's a side issue I Know he's guilty what's your take on that\nUh I completely agree I just like a like you said in the in the court of public opinion on gun\nOh no no no no I don't think that I I think in the corner public opinion Republicans\nAre absolutely supportive of cabinet Democrats absolutely hate him\nAnd people in the mid mental I think are starting to realize that there is no there there there's no those substantiate Asian\nUm I think that this country right now in cabinet is a pretty fifty fifty country when you take a look at all the polling and I think that that's borne out
