I've always said I and I invite the investigation of Kavanaugh because he's a good man\nAnd it will show that these people were creeps they were just con artists they smear it a good man and frankly the Republicans if they are in control the Senate they should continue investigating they should find out who set Kavanaugh up\nHow did this all come about whose idea was that and help restore his reputation [noise] uh those are the first two out of eight items that will happen if Democrats take control\nWe've got also number three an effort to reverse the Trump taxes they will introduce a bill to undo what they call tax breaks for corporations and millionaires now that's not going to actually get signed by Trump because he's president he has to sign the bill is not going to get to the Senate the Republicans can stop it\nUm and but there will be a major focus and the first Ninety Days on reversing what the Democrats are going to call tax breaks for the wealthy number three number four\nThey're going to try to prop up Obamacare and watch for them to pass a the restoration of the individual mandate this is our government can command that you buy insurance\nYeah government telling you what to buy 'em that was struck\nIn the very small you know watered\nDown Obamacare reform package that the Republicans got through in August of ... of last year\nA number five\nGun control yet the second amendment is going to be a absolutely on the\nChopping block they're going to go after background checks are going to go after all sorts of restrictions on guns or again the president would have to sign the bill but the house will pass those uh those pieces of legislation infringing on her Second Amendment rights\nI'm here's another one number\nFive no number six taxpayer funded Planned Parenthood will return Republicans struck Planned Parenthood a taxpayer funds\nA and a a limited\nRestrictions on it you're going to see a massive expansion of taxpayer funded I'm a programs for not just Planned Parenthood with a bunch of other gaggle of a left wing groups\nAre number seven race based and identity politics um legislation this is where you're going to see all sorts of ill GBDs to transgender nonsense coming out\nTime with us [laughter] excuse me um I've sold them that he could have an open platform to make his case I don't think the AMA campaigners are fits the district not because of his skin color\nBut because of his stand on the issues he's for open borders he's for tax increases he's for Obamacare he is\nCompletely opposite what a majority a super majority of the district that he seeks to represent uses a complete opposite his constituents on are the issues and I can finish our was accused today of having ties to terrorists\nUm there is a a a letter signed by three or generals former generals retired generals are saying that he presents a national security risk Duncan Hunter senior you know Duncan's daddy\nShowed up and said oh this is ... this is terrible you know he could be a given access to troop movements and then he could he could filter that to ISIS or al ... here's a couple of snippets from that press conference earlier today\nI wouldn't bet my live on Mr know jars not passing security information\nFor the wrong side [laughter] [laughter]\nMeasuring what are as a security risk\nThat is would you want to give him as a congressman who don't ride to know about American troop movements in the middle east would you want to give goes to him [noise] knowing that his father is a twenty three year below leader\nIs this true his father and grandfather were involved with the Palestinian liberation organization the a former group ah headed by Yasser Arafat ah\nHis grandfather was a terrorist no doubt about it I don't however see that as a connection to Emma camper news or\nI Am concerned about Emma capitals are putting money into care the coalition or the council on American is Islamic Relations care as a fringe group\nAh and ah they their their concept is always a you know the Islamophobia is is at every turn 'em they're trying to get into our schools I just don't I don't think contributing to an organization like that is appropriate for a congressional candidate\nA particularly for the fifth district so again ah you know if you're going to make accusations\nThat there are so many good ones to make it against am I can finish our he is so bad on the issues you don't need to go a down to the the uh the conspiracy theory tinfoil hat or direction\nNow and I Kevin ... is responding to the allegations that he would pass information to terrorist organizations listening\nHere's the irony every attack the hunter levees as more true about himself and his about me is under tried to get a security clearance today\nIt would not be ...\nThis was a race about Duncan Hunter being indicted by the FBI\nVersus me who was cleared by the FBI to work at the White House okay\nSo it is true ah Duncan Hunter because of his federal indictment for embezzling a quarter million dollars a campaign funds for personal years he uh currently a would fail a background check because of the criminal proceedings against him\nI'm I've read the forty seven page indictment I'm Duncan Hunter is as guilty as a day as long however you have a choice between being shot or Hong\nI'm I'm not endorsing any candidate for the fiftieth what I Am saying is voting for him I camp and those are would be a mistake is he he would get a seat for two years and vote a hundred percent opposite what his constituents would want\n[noise] so what do you do what do you do\nWell you could always strategically vote for the guy who's going to go to jail soon because ultimately when he goes to jail there'd be a special election and you can get a good representative in that seat\nWe can't go back in history in time and a change uh our votes in the primary and get a different Republican but\nYou can know that if he's found not guilty while then you can retain his seat if he's found guilty well then there's a special election so you're not voting for any individual you're just voting for a special election that's what I think you're doing in the fifth year\nComing up or are you for or against the ban on Styrofoam containers yesterday the city council voted overwhelmingly for it in San Diego I'm and even some
