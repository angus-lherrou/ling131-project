ten this is the rent control ... proposition\nA and there's also an associated uh uh uh rent control measure on the ballot here in San Diego locally in national city uh\nJoining me on the ... report to urge yes on rent control yes on prop ten is Sarah nor and she's with property owners for\nA fair and affordable housing is that correct that's it All right so Sara tell us why you think rent control is a good idea\nAnd well I Believe that everybody should have a safe healthy and a quarter of a place to call home but that's not the reality for a lot of Californians right now the rent is too high a lot of people can't afford\nTo stay in that community that they work and that they send their kids to school and that they were born and raised in a in ... and is a ballot measure that it doesn't mandate rent control it doesn't say anyone has to have rent control but it allows local communities that freedom to create the illusion that work for them to protect rent or\nGive landlord ... return and and and protect our community\nOkay you're going to economics class in college I assume like yeah\nOK why do you think that there's not an issue of supply versus demand where we've seen report after report that we're not building enough housing that our workforce is outstripping a dramatically the number of new housing units provided each year why not see this for what the economists say it is that housing prices and rent\n... are up because supply has not kept pace with demand I think that\nBuilding where housing is absolutely an important part of this election and\nProp one is on the ballot in California as well and that that will how fat government by\nThe government um the government housing bond uh so that's your solution to affordable housing you realize prop one increases the cost per unit of housing\nAbout thirty percent and in fact uh the government Accountability Office just said that uh in California the average cost for affordable housing units a seven hundred and eighty five thousand dollars per unit about your solution you want to have it on that one\nI'm here to talk about prop ... today and what popped ten does is it stopped predatory landlord from hiking up the rent on hardworking people\nOkay the building where the other thing are headed predatory\nHousing takes a long time it takes on right now in our community there are people getting on a very good\nSo why why basically hand over control command and control of our housing market to the government\nOr when they themselves build units for seven hundred and eighty five thousand dollars per unit according to the government Accountability Office meaning or in other words don't trust them\nThat government actually has not kept pace with a approving housing units at the level that the the workforce requires which again is a failure of government why are you why are you saying that prop ten is a good idea when basically calls for even more government involvement regulation federal that's not how it\nCosts about ... that's not accurate cost the Hopkins is a state law that mandates what local communities can or can't do crop ten will return the control to local communities\nSo they can control the housing market no no no no it is accurate because rent control is\nGovernment control much more control over the regulation and the mandate of housing and housing prices so why do you think do you ever make control is a better idea than actually getting the hell out of the the way of the market and letting them actually build to some to provide the supply\nThat is what economists say is the number one problem Ninety five percent of the problem is supply the lack of supply why not deal with Ninety five percent of the problem\nBuilding where housing is important but rent control as an important protecting people in the here and now who's rent is too high who are getting forced out of their community it is important\nOkay let's talk about some of the problems with rent right in ... San Francisco as some of the most stringent rent control in the entire nation and yet they have some of the highest housing prices how do you explain that\nSan Francisco and LA that have rent control have actually built more than their share of new housing units compared to other cities in California\nAnd are actually behind each of those jurisdictions are also behind on the growth of their work for now that's incorrect I Know that it actually in it that actually is correct there behind in the growth of their workforce meaning the deficit the delta continues to grow that was talking about the other argument against rent control which is if you apply rent control\nThere actually will be a massive increase in the cost of rentals because landlords will simply sell because they don't want to be under the thumb of government regulations rules mandates in litigation\nThey'll just simply selling convert those units into\nA single family units for ownership rather than rent well how do you respond to that\nWell first of all I think any landlord who want to sell their unit because they don't want to be in the rental business and if they don't want to charge fair rent or adopt reasonable protections for tenants they can tell they're getting it and then that will be an opportunity for someone to buy a home\nAnd I know no no no no no you drive a motive there you just said landlords you sell their homes because they don't want to be under the federal government regulation don't want to charge Steyer rent prices I mean that seems to be a pretty big slam on people who own property so back to the back to the other and\nTeam sport that's like saying the treat is going to make it then you know darn well treat wouldn't have made it and make it yeah because you do well ... shock treatment that's how they got to do to obey there's something wrong with you yeah there is a hey the FBI is warning anyone that gets paid through direct deposit which is most of us now\nBe on the lookout for these phishing emails requesting any personal information logging credentials your bank account look those credentials still still um that'll be used to change all bank account information it'll block any alert that you would otherwise get\nWarning of changes to your direct deposit that has redirected to another account controlled by the identity the so many threats in today's connected world\nIt all takes is just one weak link for criminals to get in a good nurses the all new life lock identity theft protection was the editor power a boost up north in security and they help protect you against threats\nTo your identity or devices that you can see your picks on your own protect your good name your reputation your bank account your retirement accounts don't have people take credit card loans and your name\nJust go to a life walk dot com or call one eight hundred life lock Andrew my name Hannity you get an extra ten percent off your first year and for a limited time uh twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with your annual enrollment like walk dot com one eight hundred life walk but break right back talking to [noise]\nTry to chase them on the\nNews radio six on [noise] go go\n\nTo San Diego county critic traffic better than a stall you spot on the phone on a version of backup corresponding leave right behind that some ... village drive to governor responsible to California for ... marching in Togo ... real time pressure to update to the Rio free\nSamples of gas tax bond waste today at three mile report will be easier\nFor these guys as he goes around the country\nAnd keep harmful and find out that you made\nAnd where are you finding the names in American can you just get the active again and again you just want to be paying for engagement\nRing can no longer ... oh no way to the I think the American lung association fighting to end up finding ... on the thing that make it ... the thing\nWe can use your turn in the fight fighting or read it that can only see American lung association fighting to protect\nThe air we breathe and go in and out that you can get [noise]\nFinding ... or\n\nI Am of these and I need for Fox News channel were loaded up we have Newt Gingrich Lindsey Graham\nWe have Senate candidates from Missouri Josh Hawley and from Arizona Martha ...

that Democrats would likely do if they captured the majority a lot of it had to do with investigating Donald Trump and raising taxes and all that stuff\nBut one item had to do with not funding the border wall and not funding ice or border patrol a staffing improvements or frankly some of them want to ban ice or get rid of a ... immigration and Customs Enforcement bureau\nBut I wanted to put a find a point on it because\nI actually think that if the Democrats win control of the U.S house of representatives you're going to see a massive spike in illegal immigration\nHas nothing to do with whether they build the wall or not\nIs nothing to do with um the staffing at ice or border patrol has everything to do with the message that has sent when the Democrats control the house representatives and that is hey usa has an overboard or again because the Democrats are in charge and you know they don't like guys they've banned those they do want border patrol\nPeople in other countries don't really pay attention to our politics as much\nSo they'll hear that Congress got taken over by Democrats and everybody knows that Democrats like an open border so all the coyote is allowed to be out there trying to convince people to give them money to infiltrate the United states and make it across the border um so it in any proof positive of that\nIs a is two things first well let's ask the experts a we actually have a a a guy who knows a little bit about this you know Tom Homan is a time of a nose a little bit about immigration and Customs Enforcement he's the former ice acting director\nUh this is what he had to say about if Democrats\nCapture control\nShould be the biggest issue we're talking about and I hope the voters are paying attention what's happening because of the denser control the house this caravan issue is going to happen every week on keep coming because there's no consequences only tourists are illegal activity while we stopped\nSo you know President Trump he has the right ideas we need we need to Republicans in Congress back what we need some changes in what we know how to fix this we just got to have the willpower to fix it the ... will have the willpower or the ... or desire\nSo you vote Democrat in November you essentially guarantee that there will be a continual and nonstop migration of of the populations of poor Central American countries through Mexico flowing in the United states period I mean to us for thirty four years I can hear into his\nOkay and and I totally agree with them but let me get finer point on us and the data I think is is is is a proof positive when Donald Trump was elected president November it was such a shocker right ah do you know that\nIllegal border crossings went down by sixty five percent nationwide sixty five percent and included in the San Diego region a sixty five percent drop in the illegal border crossings not because we were doing necessarily anything new um but because well frankly\nUh people got the word that this guy is now in charge and he doesn't want to let people in and we're going to get arrested if we try and he is there's a new sheriff in town\nJust the election of Donald Trump caused a momentary lapse a a of a stem the tide of illegal immigrants but then after a year of trumping\nIn office the numbers started creeping back up again even though Trump was giving ice and border patrol more leeway to actually in enforce the law\nWhereas Obama had tied their hands so why is that happening even though they had more authority and more back up and support and and and tools why did illegal crossings go up well\nPeople realize who want to get in this country oh Trump's just president but the Congress hasn't build the wall and there's not enough staffing so we should go back and try to cross the border\nThe reverse is true Democrats capture control you can bet your bottom dollar there'll be a spike in illegal immigration in this country\nComing up speaking of\nOur election guide the right or wrong won won\nBy our guest is running for reelection and the fifty first congressional district his opponent is also a won a good one
