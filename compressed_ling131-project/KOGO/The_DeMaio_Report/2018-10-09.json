Supreme Court another a comment from a a writer at the the Daily Show not the Daily Show um [noise] uh who's that guy Kohl bears a Late Show set at well at least we ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life\nYes he actually tweeted that at least we ruined his life you know what though as venomous and nasty as that comment was their reflected a whole lot of other animals is out there and it's also accurate because even though Brett Kavanaugh got confirmed to the Supreme Court I'm Glad that he did\nHe's never going to shake this in some parts of our country among some of the most vile\nNasty leftist pockets they will still refer to him as a sexual predator and a rapist twenty Thirty years from now when he passes away is a ... mentioned this dark period\nAnd these nasty allegations that were never substantiated my hope is that the Republicans don't give up on an investigation that they actually say that let's let's get we got to look at the collusion we got to look at who was lying here we have to look at whether people intentionally lied\nOr or manipulated things uh uh try to take down a confirmation hearing because we cannot allow that behavior to go without punishment is going to the next one\nSide the five\nStories you're talking about numbers to\nOf this part of this is that the elections or four weeks from tomorrow small\nLisa Murkowski of Alaska was the only Republican senator to vote against Brett Kavanaugh ... she was a a non vote or with some of the pairing that took place ... looking across lines to mention all you saw was the only Democrat to vote for\nUh the Kevin a confirmation and President Trump here today said that Lisa Murkowski will never recover from this and there are plenty more things that may fall out of there was some discussion Carl of if the Democrats took back the house they start the impeachment process of ... on the Supreme Court\nBut you need sixty seven senators to go along with you for that and that won't happen for anybody on either side for quite some time\nOkay so the political fallout is going to be very interesting here um [noise] a lot of folks are saying well I'm Democrats are going to be really eager to show up because uh it's a now a me too movement it's a women's rights movement\nUm first and foremost hogwash okay E. and people may be excited to show up because they think that a predator guy on the Supreme Court but you're an idiot okay if you actually believe that I Hope to God that you never find your way on any jury in this country because you will find people guilty just based on a whiff of a accusation\n[noise] ah but I also don't agree that Democrats are going to benefit\nFrom the a quote unquote turnout bump\nA their turnout was already really solid they hate Donald Trump you didn't need another reason to show up may Donald Trump that was a reason enough you didn't need to give them an extra reason to show up so I don't think it's a bit benefit to to the Democrats and do you think Republicans dodged a bullet\nOr because if they had failed to get ... capital cross the finish line and if they\nFailed to vote to confirm him it would have demoralized the Republican base I think Matt Republicans are probably going to be more excited to show up because they saw a good man gets smeared\nA so again a lot of people are going to say it's the women's movement that's going to fuel the Democrat um you know turn out that turnout was already baked it was already in the equation they don't like Trump the air go they show up I think this net will probably end up helping Republicans now\nSusan Collins apparently ah there's now a movement under way\nTo amongst Democrats to crowdsource funding for her opponent whoever that may be um apparently there's a whole discussion

crossroads of the west now the county board of supervisors they've got their eye on our Second Amendment rights as well joining me on the demand report to bring us up to speed on the latest assault against freedom\nMichael short San Diego county gun owners Michael thanks for stopping by\nA car you don't well I'm getting frustrated it's like whack a mole every single time we think we're we're we're we're done with another attack on our freedoms another group of politicians step up and they say and then now we're going to take your freedom in this respect\nYes any kind of the county board of supervisors and it's five Republicans and they're entertaining the idea of shutting down your ability to shoot on public land in San Diego I Can't imagine\nThis this wouldn't happen anywhere else in the nation but it's happening here in San Diego and it's being led by Diane Jacob who's the supervisor out here in east county and she's been trying for years uh to appease the very small group of\nAh extremist environmentalist that ah that ah you know the ... that are in her district who want to shut down shooting on public lands they just want us to end they'd\nAlso how does how does the San Diego county board of supervisors have oversight or jurisdiction on public land are we talking about land owned by the county or land owned by the federal government 'cause we have a lot of federal land holdings in San Diego county\nWell that's an excellent question and it we thought we were safe because we're talking about is federal land um and she pushed to die and Jacob pushed about a year ago to try to get the the federal government to shut down shooting and they they didn't they didn't budge\nBut what they found is that there is a a it's kind of a convoluted and around but they found that there is a memo of of understanding or dated Nineteen Ninety between the county and the feds and and do it sheriff and forcing\nA you know laws on federal land and basically the federal government says a\nYou know if you you you know the kind of gets to call the shots on certain things so the county so say there is no shooting on federal land\nThan they would actually be able to enforce that law with using the sheriff's department but you know the thing about this is the same sheriff's department that won't arrest illegal aliens because that's federal about what what now that we're being asked to arrest\nKnow Americans for exercising their Second Amendment right on public land it's absolutely convoluted and ridiculous\nLand owned by the federal government or how about that but we contacted department of interior secretary a thinking yeah he's a he's a Second Amendment supporter\nSo I assure you that it's happening and we're working on that and we have some some very reliable channels directly to him but in the meantime you know they're having a hearing tomorrow the San Diego county board of supervisors\nA at a sixteen hundred Pacific highway downtown so you know in the ... the county building\nAnd it's going to be a hearing where they're going to talk about uh trying to push this forward so while working uh to influence the federal government through a structures and key we need to stand up to the county board and make sure that what they know what they're doing is wrong and we don't agree\nI totally agree and I can't believe that the county board would even entertain or anything that infringes on our Second Amendment rights are all Republican and I'm looking at you Christian gas bar you've never been good on Second Amendment so I Am I'm worried about you\nA Ron Roberts\nUh Greg Cox I mean I I I worry that we're not going to the votes even though this is an all Republican board\nWell it really is when I looked on the list uh I I don't

sometimes individuals\nWho have been convicted of a criminal offense today was his first full day on the job\nOfficially hearing a arguments for and against cases so uh let me start out with the news of a our good friend um and Nikki Haley and and let me just say when the Haley was nominated to be the UN ambassador I was kind of surprised me 'cause she was governor of South Carolina\nAnd a not a whole lot of foreign policy experience like you know I think she had her birthday one set a chi jeeze [noise]\nUh and maybe went overseas a couple of times on on on on trips but I was I was really going ah I was hoping that a different candidate was going to get the UN ambassador ship more on that in a minute because I think it has to do with why she's leaving but\nUm so I was surprised\nAnd to me it was it was almost as though the Trump Administration had a bunch of men that it had named deposed early on Rex Tillerson the secretary of state Jeff Sessions to the Justice Department had those workout [laughter]\nUm but it was a very male heavy can't a cabinet and so they had to come up with a woman they came up with Nikki Haley and people are like Nikki Haley foreign policy really but to my surprise she has done remarkably well I Am so thrilled for her I'm so happy for her in terms of\nUm the way in which she handled herself there was a couple of areas where she and the White House ... kind of were off message but you get that in any administration anyway abruptly today\nYou know and it came out that she's leaving\n'em and er you heard her in our opening it's been the author of a lifetime\nUm and uh ... official Washington was rocked they were shocked well it's not like she sent a letter to the president she went to the White House they did a an above a media event in the oval office she said look I Want you to come back at some point\nUm you can have any position you want you done a great job a Nikki Haley made it clear I'm not running for president I fully support President Trump for reelection and twenty twenty\n[noise] there's all sorts of ah a speculation now\nThe state department says that she only told her staff about her resignation earlier this morning [noise] another source said that the uh resignation caught national security adviser John Bolton completely off guard\n[noise] same thing with secretary of state Mike Pompeo the question is why why is she leaving well first and foremost\nUh people are saying that well you know she's a politician she likes being top dog and when it comes to foreign policy the UN ambassador is an important role but it's not like she's like leading the charge on foreign policy issues she's done a great job a and frankly I Would consider her one of our best un ambassadors\nYeah [noise] um but I don't know\nMaybe she was feeling as governor she wants to be your own a person and and and and be more of a power house she has to compete with people like Mike Pompeo the current secretary of state or even Bolton who used to be the UN ambassador he's now national security advisor\n[noise] a second money\nYet these positions or you know they pay well but you can earn a whole lot more out in the private sector and uh her financial disclosure showed a number of debts or a including twenty five thousand to sixty five thousand dollars in revolving credit credit card that\nA mortgage and excessive a million dollars a line of credit of up to five hundred thousand dollars she's only making a hundred and Seventy thousand as the UN ambassador so what does that mean\nNow might be a great time for her to cash in when the president is still in office uh and uh she's got the opportunities to make money\nOr third she's running for president which I don't buy I Do not for a moment do I buy that she's running for president if Trump does not run for reelection witches or the possibility and Mike Pence cello\nHe's the next in line there's a lot of other politicians that would probably give Nikki Haley a run for money and she'll be out of office she won't be un ambassadors you won't be in the public light people may not remember how good of a job he did\nWas her three common\nTheories I've got a different theory and it has everything to do with the game of musical chairs going on in Washington\nI think some of you may know where I'm headed with this let me tell you what I think's going to happen with Nikki Haley maybe is what I Want\nTo have happened with her but I actually think there's a pretty good likelihood and and I know that there is someone who's got an inside track for the un job I was all coming up on the report bless the cabinet or a debacle the Supreme Court fight\nThere still a ripple effect there there's a couple of stories that we need to bring to your attention and we need to
