prop six a bus tour the gas tax a car tax repeal initiative\nUm but we've got other races that were given your coverage on we're going to return to our discussion on the caravan of four thousand Mexican or sorry four thousand a Central American\nMigrants traveling through Mexico on their way up the up to the United states during her five o'clock hour we'll get back to that but uh we do have a voter guide up online at\nSan Diego election guide dot org San Diego election guide dot org all coverage of all races including ballot measures local and state and all candidate races along with my endorsements are on there at San Diego election guide dot org\nNow one race that's getting a lot of ads tons millions and millions of ads is a position that's not known by many people\nIt's the state superintendent of schools uh and uh you got your local school boards that take care of your local schools but the state also has a pretty darn big role in the superintendent of schools calls the shots there\nJoining me on the report is my endorsed candidate for state superintendent of schools Marshall tucked Marshall thanks for stopping by\nThanks for having me and thanks as always for focusing on our kids in our public schools\n[noise] so uh why are you running for state superintendent of schools and what does the position do in terms of authority\nI think you know that's quite well given your own personal journey but you know public schools the reason I Believe so deeply in our public schools is with a quality education every child regardless of his or her circumstances as a real shot up in the person that they want to be\nAnd that's the beauty of public education that to me as a foundation of of the American dream which is your car do you play by the rules\nYou have a chance a better life and and for that to be a reality we have to make sure\nEvery child has a quality public education and right now as you and are speaking California public schools great state of California are public schools for forty fourth in the country\nForty fourth but at the unacceptable so we have to bring\nReal change our public schools and most of the rules actually come out of Sacramento and that's why I'm running for state superintendent which is the top education official in the state of California we're gonna bring real change our public schools and get fears about where California should be which is which are the best public schools the country\nAnd of course I think part of the problem is that most of the rules for education in schools um there is coming from Sacramento and they're they're just out of touch and they've got crazy ideas what really would be your program of action for improving schools if you're elected to the position\nThat you mentioned are first and foremost we got to get rid of a lot of those rules you know I I've led public schools in Los Angeles for over Fifteen Years and south LA you sell a lot of our most challenged neighborhoods and we had\nA lot of great success in our schools we doubled graduation rates I helped open tent new schools all serving low income kids it was ten schools recognized by US News and World Report amongst about high school in the country but it became very clear to me there are way way way too many decisions coming out of Sacramento the critics huge bureaucracy and so we've got this book\nI I'm sure you've seen it the California education code it's twenty five hundred pages\nIt's eight point fun it's just full of rules and regulations that tastes creativity innovation out of the hands of teachers and principals and replaces it with a bunch of red tape to step one is we got to give a lot more local control\nLet's give our principals and teachers much more flexibility from that book so we can have real innovation and real decisions made by teachers principals and parents that are closest to our kids and then we always got to make sure we're investing in our teachers and principals you know there's nothing more important I got a\nSeven year old son he goes to our local public school\nNothing more important to him than a teacher in front of him and and the principal to support those teachers and we've got some work to do our teacher training programs are stuck in the past you know we're not providing enough support\nThat over at the void of San Diego let's talk about that liberal blog um so the void of San Diego a sits there like most of the media and you know I've been talking about the waste full spending of gas tax funds all up and down in the state of California\nAnd in San Diego we identified a buses that are costing us three times the national average a massive are expensive four point one million dollars per bus parking space at a Seventy five million dollar temporary bus parking facility [noise]\nWe identified six figure salaries\nWe identified as swank pricey a celebration party for sb one we identified a that a Caltrans employee came out and ...\nAdmitted just in mid September that one third of the road maintenance budget for San Diego from Caltrans the Eighteen million dollars a third six point two million goes to clean up after the homeless population\nWasn't our statement it was ...\nSo the void of San Diego do you think they report on any of that other documented waste no no no no no they think that they could a cast aspersions on my claim about the uh money being used for homeless\nAgain it's not my claim it's actually Caltrans is playing\nAnd it's been reported cited in the reader quoted a Caltrans state a spokesperson so they come out saying radio host ... the architect behind the gas extra appeal is raising many flags about transportation spending as you can in hopes set a few fly\nOh really their hopes that if you fly your virus is showing that saying that you're biased a show now me\nAnd when you take a look at where the\nStory goes from there\nSays the latest claimed to bio claims money for roads is being spent on homelessness\nYeah that would be true my dear\nBut she then writes an article as though it's not true because Caltrans says none of the SP one funds go into homeless clean up's that's from a different part of the Caltrans budget\nOkay specifically what they said to the voice of San Diego a Senate bill one funds are dedicated transportation improvements are not used for reaching maintenance such as literary move [noise]\nAll right that's that's the one that would be the car tax increase and the gas tax supplemental increase\nBut might I ask\nIs their funding for Caltrans other than SP one the answer is yes yes indeed I Know cuts those pearls I Know you are just shocked you're about to be exposed as a fraudulent fake journalists use really sloppy\n[noise] now my dear\nTake a toilet bowl and filling up with one cup of water\nThat one cup of water is SP one tax increase\nBut there's another big pitcher\nOf water here it comes to my dear oh there goes to that level where your reputation as a that other water is the existing gas tax which by the way is the fourth highest in the country the SP one increase gives us the highest in the country the car tax also is put in there\nA couple of other you know revenue sources are also in their mixed in but mainly we\nAlready had a gas tax my dear I Know it comes as a shock to you oh my God there's a gas tax other than SP one yes my dear that's why when ... six passes we will get rid of sb won the tax increase but there will still be a gas tax in ... in the state of California one of the highest in the country\nAnd you know what those homeless money's come from that gas tax\nRoad maintenance monies\nAre being funded\nBy gas tax moneys\nAnd those road may maintenance monies are being consumed to clean up after homeless camps you my dear are wrong your at\nReporter but you know what we know that you're not a reporter you're just a\nBlogger who has a big bias and oh you have is a laptop\nAttitude and way too much time on your hands\nI mean I'm just calling about I'm so sick and tired of ignoring all sorts of examples of waste fraud and abuse then they pick one waste fraud and abuse example where they think they can try to show throw some shade on it and they can't even do that you couldn't throws shade on that if you had a whole entire a solar eclipse\nIt's documented\nWe gave you the quote from the Caltrans manager\nAnyone out there reads the void of San Diego or God Forbid donates for crappy biased journalism just stop\nThat's I mean it is so easy to pick apart this lame excuse at a an attempted takedown of well documented research from the gas tax repeal campaign you can judge for yourself\nGo to a gas tax repeal dot org gas tax repeal dot org click on the top ten gas tax fraud waste abuse examples and you'll find\nThat that example is one of the ... and well documented coming up inside the fire the top stories of the day and we do have to talk about a billion dollar lotto tickets\nOh yeah what would you do with that what would you do with that money and how much in taxes would you have to pay 'cause you know how I think that's something to report
