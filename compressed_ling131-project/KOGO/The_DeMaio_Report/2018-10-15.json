E. S. U. west project where's there's no taxpayer money on the measure a project\nAnd\nThey're not paying fair market value for the last I don't think either party is paying fair market value but San Diego State University is paying even less for this tax payer land it's still valuable it's owned by you and me through the water department which means our water rates were raised by this land\nWe should get the top dollar so we can defray the cost of water those are just some of the problems with measure gee what are your thoughts let's go to um let's go to Dave in Carlsbad Dave you got the floor [noise]\nI'm Wondering and environmental record on that I\nWonder what we're going to say that\nThat's a good question that now now there's two terms that you got there and one is environmental\nAssessment and the other is a the environmental impact quality report under the California environmental quality act\nOr one is a legal document the other is I think to your point you know what is the environment like there now the environment is up to the developers they get the land and they got to mitigate they have to figure out you know whether their oil plumes any sort of remediation they've got to deal with that uh but\nUnder measure ie the soccer city measure their exempt from the California environmental quality act because the citizens' initiative\nWhere as measured gee does not make them exempt from the California environmental quality act however the decision is made at the state level so we lose local control so if there are traffic impacts they could decide not to mitigate those traffic\nImpacts I don't like the idea that they're not the ones having to sit in the damn traffic we are I Hope that answered your question\nEight hundred six hundred cocoa eight hundred six hundred and five six for six or let's go real quick Jew or Don and point Loma a related question on environmental contamination go ahead Don real quick\nHere and um you get brought it up a a loan that's underneath the stadium and responsible or if you're you're ... you're not responsible for the other of the responsible\nArticle technically a tent or in a string\nTechnically both would still be responsible but at least with the private developers under measure each soccer city you can hold them more accountable\nBy doing an environmental assessment yourself through the city by holding them by finding them by saying no you have to do more remediation whereas if we give all the local control to the California State University board of regents up in Sacramento\nThey get to decide how much environmental cleanup needs to happen not our local city council in there\nAnd I don't trust them I just don't I mean the you know colleges and universities are all well and good but they're not white nights they they they actually have some pretty bad ah records themselves when it comes to compliance environmental quality health and safety\nUh so don't assume just because oh well there are public university ah yeah and\nUh so I Am concerned about the loss of local control under measure gee\nI'm coming up more of your thoughts more of your questions I Hope I'm answering them as good as possible um there's another major problem I'm having with measure G and that has to deal with the well the deception as part of the measure all explain coming up on the demand report eight hundred six hundred cocoa eight hundred six hundred and five six for six\nThan it's done and we get to go and reset the clock does that make sense All right but what if both get fifty percent is that your other question what if both get fifty percent then how do we deal with this ah ha if\nBoth get fifty percent than the measure that has the most votes prevails and the other measure is wiped out entirely\n[noise] so when you have two measures on the same topic on the same ballots the ... both measures still have to ... to pass you have to get the fifty percent\nBut the one with the most votes above fifty percent than controls and wipes out the other so it is impossible for you to approve both measures it's also not correct that whichever gets the most votes no matter\nWhat wins because if neither get fifty percent they both fail does that make sense ... I Hope I answered your question [noise] uh let's go to Dee in San Diego oh gee I agree with you on this point\n\nYou dropped her point was no one gee yes on soccer city because she doesn't trust as he has huge actually do that the project on time and that is\nThe point I was going to make about um ... what what is being deceptive here is that they're promising us all these things but SJSU\nA has had a very spotty record on getting things done of actually doing projects that are already approved they already have expanded\nA authority for an expanded campus the Alvarado campus and they haven't used that they drag their feet and the city of San Diego actually had to sue I'm\nSo they could actually be sitting in the dumps the old Qualcomm Stadium for the next decade and you and me would be forced to subsidize that stadium with our tax dollars for six million dollars a year this\nIs a very deceptive measure and by the way as the as you\nUm pretend like oh we're not involved in the ballot measure but they're doing all sorts of ads you know that they're involved in the ballot measure when someone's being deceptive what else are they lying about who I Am not just no on measure gee I'm hell to the no on measure gee\nAlright coming up we're going to shift gears 'cause I Want to give the other side measure eat an equal opportunity to explain and walk through their proposal that's coming up on the ... report first traffic\nAnd the ... traffic center he spent eight at West main street tragic alert crashed lacking in the middle lanes traffic is bad now spring street\nAnd then on Sunday we have ... the left lane and that's why traffic ... seven and backing up on these having to Bradley so it's pretty ugly in the home right now that we have an accident on the east side and Kevin ... valley rose\nThe right lane is black and traffic is coming to stop and think I'm more\nSurround sound coming off the split the street you can expect a forty three minute commute at this time the bridges backing up and ... is it thirty nine minute drive from ... ... is ... by UPS Store I'm more I can cause next real time traffic face is it for twenty ...\nTwenty one of the many teams the UPS to provide for your business business ... most during wiring it's all professional and easy at the UPS door\nEvery team personal lives and of course\nShipping so you heard me talk about Todd Cornell of the Edward group and what a great job he does on renovating homes helping people get their dream home built or renovated\nUh let me tell you not only does he do a great job at giving you your dream home he can help you make money you know we have enough for double housing crisis a shortage of housing units\nAnd Todd is working with investors who've taking money out of the stock market taken some cash reserves and they are buying old units and\nRenovating into multi unit a of the housing just sell a profit now you might say well Carl I don't know anything about permits or development rights yeah but Todd does and that's where he comes and\nSit down with him he'll walk you through some of the project she's dealing with other investors and maybe it would be a great opportunity for you to make money check him out at ... dot com he'll sit down for a free consultation with you just schedule it through T.
