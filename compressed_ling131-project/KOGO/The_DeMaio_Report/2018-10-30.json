upset her bills keep getting higher and higher and she's really struggling she said what can I Do can I worked for the campaign is that what we're all volunteer\nUm I I Know that she owns a home and I said what was the last time you talk to someone to refinance and she said oh I've had my mortgage for eight years and I'm fine on that\nI said well talk to Kevin lions an anchor funding and I explained to her how the credit card debt that she's carrying and she was carrying about twenty thousand dollars in credit card debt or an Israeli freaking her out she stressed\nWe are using NASCAR

authority given to us by Secretary Mattis the units that are normally is on weapons they are in fact the polling with weapons\nThe troops will be a mix of active duty reserve a National Guard forces at an all Seventy two hundred there's two thousand thereabouts now they're going to send another five thousand so the more than seven thousand troops by the time these latest the troop members are deployed\nOkay a will there's solve the problem now because we have a broken immigration legal system that allows people to just walk in and say you're sorry refugee and boom they they get brought in they don't come back for their immigration herring Eighteen months later immigration courts are clogged up\nUh we got to change the immigration laws but I liked the idea that we have a bigger presence at the border I\nFear however cliff that they these coyotes no the law or we have a very permissive immigration and asylum a program it's absurd no other country has it it it's why we have such a problem with illegal immigration this is a loophole that needs to be closed and dealt with\n'em up to Congress maybe to do something about the yeah and it's not going to happen anytime soon and that's what's frustrating us all\nBut politically it will work sending these troops sends a message to the Republican base hey I'm doing stuff look and put it in the military of the border don't

cut\nThey ... they snake the road repair funds I mean you also point out that this was all done without a gas tax increase\nThe if you have a willingness to put money into a road repairs it can be done and what the city is actually doing is they're now implementing the proposal I put out and Twain twelve which would say um any increase revenue above the baseline has to first go to a infrastructure\nAnd as a result every new dollar that comes in the door it's going into the infrastructure account to make those repairs the priority\nAnd then what it does is it presents a bigger percentage of your budget for red repairs which is what really need to get back to again progress made but uh no not by any stretch or we anywhere near where we need to be\nHas the right to get it

ago eight hundred six hundred five six for six let me know if you think\nWe should change citizenship rules in this country\nOr the president has opened up that debate a calling him a racist for it or they are saying that what he's doing is unconstitutional but actually no uh he's not a racist for it because frankly most countries handle it the way he suggests we should handle it\nAnd they don't just let people who are born on their soil become citizens in fact\nAre only thirty three countries only thirty three countries\nAre in the world allow um individuals' become citizens automatically if ah they are born on the soil the vast majority of countries because there's more than a hundred and fifty hundred and sixty country's vast majority are\nActually a handle it completely differently and uh does that make them racist no I don't think it makes it racist at all I think it means that they actually are well actual nation states that um are allowing a a process\nAnd defining their own process for who becomes a citizen who earn citizenship who gets entered into their club\n\nUh all the countries in Europe Brandt automatic citizenship by right of blood right of blood which means\nYour parents some like France also offer a path to children of immigrants to acquire citizenship at age Eighteen so I guess Europe is filled with a bunch of racist countries yeah mhm I think\nNow a lot of us neighbors in North and South America\nAllow birthright citizenship so Mexico and Central America\nSo Trump was not exactly right when he said what are the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby in the babies essentially citizen to the United states\nThat's not true not true it's one of\nA handful of country [laughter] that allow it that way or the next thing I Want to point out is that a individuals are going to say that it's a constitutional issue unconstitutional for the president to be suggesting or a change\nThat's not true at all there's actually two paths to adjudicate him this number one is either a law or an executive order has to be passed\nAnd then someone who disagrees with it gets to sue and it goes to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court gets to decide because guess what that's how we have the current process we are in right now where someone could become an anchor baby and get citizenship and and keep mom and dad you're in this country which is the whole cottage industry one of the big strategies\nFor getting into this country\nIs anchor babies\nOr we do a constitutional amendment to make it quite clear in fact we may have to do a constitutional amendment but there's no immediate conclusion that it has to be constitutional amendment because there's actually could become an executive order tomorrow someone says oh my gosh I Wish I had a baby in this\nCountry and this this baby is a citizen and the Trump Administration says no that's not how we're going to interpret things and that person than Susan what happens it goes to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court\nDecides it decides yes or no if they decide that the president actually could change it\nWell there you go it's done no constitutional amendment no act of Congress if they say well hold on a second Congress has to decide this it could be done but only Congress can decide them well then we don't need a constitutional amendment or what they could say is\nNeither the president and nor the Congress can make a change your unless you change the fourteenth amendment\nSo all the crap you're going to hear tonight on television any analyst she says well it's clearly unconstitutional they don't know what the hell they're talking about they don't know what the hell they're talking about\nAnd if they want to play the race card there just narrative driving is nothing more than a political opinion what are your thoughts should we change the policy is Trump right eight hundred six hundred cocoa eight hundred six hundred and\nFive six for sex let's go with\nDa da da da da da da da da da\n\nDa ding ... guy\nRe senator Trumbull Howard ... who wrote the fourteenth amendment and they're all on record and the congressional record they ... they were before the Senate vote on rather radical and they all free fed ugly does not apply to foreigners\nOr Indian why ... ... is is ah eighth later and he was\nGlenn may and let me let me read that case real quick hold the line elk versus Wilkins\nEighteen eighty for the Supreme Court denied the birthright citizenship claim of an American Indian the court ruled that being born in the territory United States is not a sufficient\nUh a status for citizenship\nThose you wish to claim citizenship by birth must be born subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nAnd the court majority held that the children of American Indians are Native Americans or we're no more born in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof within the meaning of the first section of the first fourteenth amendment then the children of subjects of any foreign government born within the domain of the ... of the government\nAnd uh the history of Supreme Court cases on this matter shows that there is a great latitude of different opinions and definitions that we have to sort through and I for one would love to see the president trigger that constitutional review with an executive order\nThat's why the president I think was surprised when he found out he could do it I think uh you probably have some sharp lawyers who've looked at this and said actually this Supreme Court could come to a different conclusion uh and could give us a a roadmap for how we ended the practice of anchor babies\nOn a legal basis that's what the president's doing but let me tell you why he's making these remarks this week\nWe have the mid term election and he's trying to fire up the base I'm going to be completely blunt even though I agree with that this should be a debate a public policy the reason why President Trump has the drop this little bombshell\nIs because he's trying to excite the base what did he do a couple of days ago he ordered the U.S military she's a border you said if you show up we're going to arrest you you're going to be met by um or the military or the United states you're not going to get through and Donald Trump\nOr is talking about tent cities at the border as well\nAll of this is designed to show the base that while we don't have a border wall at this point in the Congress has not funded the border wall and we're very disappointed in that\nYou should show up because we are working we are trying to get a secure border and here's some of the specific policies that we're pursuing did you hear that the Trump comments on the ten cities\nYou also mentioned that and lost twenty four hours again\nAdding to the evidence he's trying to marshal\nTo gin up the issue of immigration and with more focus on immigration more turnout of Republicans the better Republicans will do in the mid term election I'm just calling it like it is guys and gals you this is a lot of politics being played here but there's also some good policy here here's a Donald Trump\nOn the tent cities remark or cut number six\nAnd they also ... going to hold them until such time as a trial where we have the facilities are we going to put up we're going to build ten cities will go to Penn so all over the place we're not going to build structures and spend all of this you know hundreds of millions of dollars\nWe're gonna have to pass they going to be very nice and they're going to wait and if they don't get asylum they get out and very few people they don't actually if you want to wait they don't usually get asylum you know the eighty percent Brian as\nThey released them and and then they have the trial three years later and nobody shows up but we're you know unlike Obama and unlike others we're going to take the people were going to put 'em in and they're going to wait\nAnd you know what to things happen when they find out that that happens that far fewer people come up [noise]\nAnd also President Obama separating children from Paris nobody talks about the long and said can have separated now President Obama separate out in the beginning\n[noise] love it and this is really what needs to happen until we change the asylum process so that you have to apply for asylum in the embassy of a country way far away\nAnd then we adjudicate your case there because you know we have technology you can have an immigration judge totally do remote Skype or hearing 'em until we change the the law we cannot let these people um enter the United states\nThey have to be detained a tent cities if so be it if if if necessary fine again the president is correct most of these cases the vast majority eighty percent get completely rejected why because they're not political refugees or economic refugees\n\nThey know if they use the term\nYou saw a refugee I'm persecuted that we let them in the old administration Obama's administration Bush or Clinton they let these people in and then\nUh Seventy five percent of them never showed up for their immigration herring and by the way the immigration courts or show backlog do that it's about Eighteen months before you're hearing is is a schedule\nAnd by that point what happens they pop out a baby and now they've got an anchor\nThis is the sick and broken twisted dysfunctional and mapped immigration system that we have they're taking advantage of the laws and so what the president is doing is he's understanding\nThe legal problems here he understands the the loopholes he understands the games All right this is a game it's a racket and what he's doing is he's shutting the doors is tightening the screws you saying okay you're going to play that card fine we'll play this card\nWe're not going to just let you into the United states and say come show up at a immigration hearing down the road oh we're going to say you stay here at the border in a tent sorry no air conditioning will give you food take care of your needs as we're generous country but once you go through and do your immigration\nStatus sharing and determined that you're not a refugee you got to go to gauge due process dude\nWas really needed because that's very expensive and other military down there and ten cities in supporting all these people what's really needed as we got to change these rules so that they are not invited to come here in the first place they don't say oh oh if I use the speak easy term I get in\nOh boy that that that that avenue got shot\nThey won't come as a result they'll stand in line as they should coming up there is some bitter reaction\nTo a Trump's proposal to and birthright citizenship you'll hear about that plus proper eleven first draft\nFrom your San Diego county credit union traffic center South Bend needle side is the fifty five minute drive now from the splits has an idea for the five\nThat it jumped up to sixty minutes hitting the split and my love cars way that's the way there was an accident that has been cleared super slow on the bridge all the way across and south on Fifteen after ... avenue crashed cleared over to the right shoulder but not before jamming things up to the one sixty three\nI'm Laura ... the next real time traffic update is that for oh three\n[noise] so we've talked about retirement and the number one thing you need to be a very certain of is that your money is going to last you\nFor the number of years that you plan to be retired and nobody plans to be retired for a certain amount of time you just hope that it's a golden time for you and that you get as much time as possible some people are seeing their retirements go from Twenty years or Thirty years from Thirty years to forty years\nAnd unfortunately they're running short on funds don't get yourself in that situation have a retirement income plan by talking to the experts\nAnd no Republican president but Donald Trump has been gutsy enough to actually look at this as you know what do we do about changing this concept of anchor babies\nNow there's a lot of folks out there who say maybe there's an easier solution\nMay be the easiest solution is instead of fighting this battle to secure the border well how's that working out for you I I I think that it's not an either or I think it's an all of the above\nBuild the wall beef up the ice and the border patrol presence\nGiven the tools to do their jobs reform the e verify system so that we actually can enforce laws punished businesses that illegally higher\nCut the welfare so that there's no uh attractive benefit or or incentive for people to come to this country illegally\nOr end this concept of chain migration so that we actually can set merit Korea standards for who we invite into this country banned the practice of sanctuary cities so if you commit a crime you're out on your rear end\nAnd Oh yes let's change the asylum rules\nSo you can't just walk to the border and say you also a refugee and that's the little speak easy term to get into this country and then you disappear into the interior never to be seen again\nAnd then you pop out a baby and then when you are found oh hey maybe time that the anchor baby yet you can't get rid of me we can take care of anger maybe\nNow this is absurd this is a complete joke it is dysfunctional it is absolutely negligent is absolutely negligent\nThe ... and ... and by design okay let me talk about those Republicans out there in Washington who refused to do their damn job and actually securing the border but for Donald Trump reason why they don't want to secure the border they talk a good game\nThe reason why they don't want us to go to the borders because big business lines are pockets with campaign cash big business like cheap labor\nAnd Democrats don't want to secure border because they want the votes that's why we don't have a secure border looks like whenever they talk about raising taxes like a gas tax oh they got the votes and it gets done and boy if you don't pay up you're gonna get enforcement\nOh the IRS is there if you don't if you don't pay your taxes low Santo you're in jail\nBut break the immigration rules it's all good\nYou go have some freebies\nPut your feet up and get\nA glass of water just vote for me no worry no one will check your status just vote that's what's going on\n[noise] okay so this hour we're going to give you a chance to win a four pack of tickets to the del mar racetrack next weekend the

San Diego election and guide dot org San Diego election guide dot org\nOkay we're going to be looking at uh one of the statewide ballot propositions a proposition eleven which wouldn't change certain rules on a labor a and a workforce or a regulations for folks in the ambulance industry\nA and joining me on the dumb our report urging a yes vote on prop eleven is Ross Eliot he's executive director of the California ambulance association Ross thanks for stopping by\nI'm Glad to be here thanks for having us I appreciate it\n[noise] so what does ... eleven do\n[noise] so what about there with U.S Supreme court decision back in two thousand sixty and the guts to versus avium security\nAnd that decision and said that private security people could no longer be reachable during the rest breaks not even during an emergency so a few months after that some trial attorneys filed last if everyone is trying to apply the Augustus decision to the private ambulance industry\nAnd ... you know could basically end the longstanding practice of having him keys and paramedics available to respond at all times they would actually be unreachable if they're on a break or a meal period\nIn well so they'd be unreachable or what you would have to do is pay them time and a half isn't this really a compensation is you\nKnow I'm a ... decision says they have to be completely unreachable\nEven harder to pay\nSo you can't even pay 'em a to respond to a a nine one one caller service called ... and so does this mean that you would have to hire more people to backfill or for these individuals\nWell conceivably that's one of the solution um according to the legislative analyst office they're estimating we'd have to increase the workforce by twenty five\nPercent and and there's so many paramedics in California\nAnd so let me guess let me guess the government unions are decided hey if we can force a inefficiency if we can force a ambulance providers to have to over staff\nHave extra staff that's good for us because it means more dues painting members is that is that really why the unions are so opposed to ...\nYou know I Can't really speak for the unions but in essence what um what the court ruling would do is delay ambulance response is that's really what ... what our interest is to ensure that a a emergency ambulance responses or not the way\nOh tell me why you say I mean I think I I can imagine why but tell me why you say that if we don't pass prop alive and ambulance times will be delayed\n[noise] um if if a cruise unreachable say you're you're at home or your at work when you start experiencing chest pains and the nearest ambulance to you is on a break\nLawmakers reacting to the president I'm Marilyn hide her house Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing back against President

I get it but that this will not allow them to be responsive to respond\nAnd many years and you've said mediocrity is not\nThe best um the best vantage in our lives and that's what I see those organizations so I'm going to continue to push the button because our local economy the bite dealers and manufacturers are suffering because he's advocate they're looking for a dollar that don't get anything done\nFor years on and one in real time we can bike ride everybody to get out and ride contribute to lower missions all those good things that and health and wellness that cycling offers\nNo I agree um so so what do you think is really fueling this said that the increase in the car tax increase\nYeah you know it's again and and you address it very well on on the proposition is that\nIt's shortsighted it's we're willing to take what's given to us but we actually demand more we are a car culture and a you know that's ... years in the making for California and the necessity but\nAt the same time as a active and and help the environment we can do better for every generation to be more engaged and say we're not going to take what the hand it to us and and and want more out of our um bureaucracies and politicos\nTo really put our best interest or a versus\nConsultants and back room deal that say you know hundreds of millions of dollars are going into this but we don't see the tangible uh results that are affecting and and adding to our everyday lives and values\nWhen I ran for mayor or as you know 'cause you work the or the Bob Filner campaign\nOr I laid out a bike plan that or did two things one was committing that we would bring all of our roads and surfaces up to acceptable standards so that people have a safe roadway and therefore have sake safe areas to bike on\nBut then right accurately or when I was suggesting as we would create a almost like a metro system I'm a metro map of a variety of a key roads where we would accommodate biking\nAnd we laid out that map and and the bike community was pretty cool about it um changed since twenty twelve where there was so much agreement\nWhile you know the the the coalition's an advocate for like the ... chase the shining nickel um unfortunately you know they're still looking at the old model if you build it it'll come\nWhere again going towards what in our existing structure and one of my partner's California bicycle is partner then writer faith visibility\nWhere they train educate and engage thereby called their teams and and all of their customers to say hey you can take matters into your own hand you can be seen you can put lights on your bikes\nBecause cars motorcycles trucks have daytime running lights and if you have colored socks on call your bio motion increases your options for visibility stacking the deck\nSo education and not chasing that shiny nickel but being forward thinking and what can we do that it's not and played it in standard that going to affect our local economy stores shops\nAnd um those who wants to buy because they love it and they don't want to feel like their wives and their hands every time they get on the the road um and and are not seeing by distracted drivers\nOK so but why can't we have a conversation on us you and I can\nAnd I appreciate that but whenever I raised the issue of look ah we can't have a uh some traction here for cars it has to be both sand or a a car plus car plus bike\nI I get some of the most just at the angry emails an angry call her she say you're anti bike you hate bicyclists get out of the car you're killing the planet\nThat's that's not a way to like build up a broad based coalition for ... transportation\nRight right and I agree with you and as we've been through ... upon dozens of town hall meetings and uh I mean really it's going back to the grassroots efforts of education there are some good people trying to reach out to department of motor vehicles to have more\nSafety questions on drivers past ... past there is definitely opportunities to do that grassroots by you know as it takes time and money and the you know the advocate for themselves and they have their position and rightfully so and that's what we're about having a conversation but let's be realistic\nWhen you're celebrating twenty five years to put in a\nTwo mile bike lane along the Fifteen um that's not much to celebrate because\nThe that should've been done within a short period of time were actions speak louder than words and twenty five years cost us hundreds of millions I I you know countless dollars that are well placed and that's what the advocates have to look at his where's the action now\nI talk a lot of people that you don't ride daily uh groups clubs um organizations like I'm not going to put lights on my bike because I don't ride at night but the fact is forty seven percent of cyclists\nAccident happened during the day so advocates have to realize that we can make a difference in real time versus chasing a shiny nickel and be a little bit more forward thinking\nAnd and Clancy he's a yes vote for prop six even though he's a well known leader in the bicycle community ... stopping by and hope no one gives you too much grief in the bicycle community for taking the right position by\nThe way you need to spread the word would there is an error on the ballot here are your your your your baseball\nOr a basis you have to touch contracts all your friends and family emailed them ... the first place a first base is there's an error on your ballot to get their attention there's an error on your ballot second base the politicians intentionally mislabeled prompt six to deceive you\nThird base prop six is actually the gas tax repeal and then slide into home plate\nVote yes on prop sex to
