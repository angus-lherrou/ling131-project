are good arguments but as a fiscal conservative I think government already gets too much of our tax dollars are they they don't need more money in anything that takes tax money away from the government I'm kind of all four so what about that argument in favor of prompt five\n... ... ... yeah I can certainly see that argument and I I Know we can talk all day long about how government spend our money [noise] but if you look at the numbers and the revenue law says that crop five we'll put in place\nSpecifically for schools it becomes a problem but legislative analyst office has already a estimated that the annual property tax revenue loss would be a hundred million dollars per year state wide and that would grow to a billion dollars per year\nNo I'm sure you know about\nCalifornia's prop Ninety eight which path Nineteen and back in Nineteen eighty eight which said that if property tax revenue goes down to the schools the state has to pay that money back to ensure the funding for schools so we take a billion dollars off of the property tax revenue rules\nThe state's gonna have to pay that money back\nWhich means they can't spend it on other a wasteful spending that's all good by man rather go to the schools\nWill yeah I Would much rather go to the schools um it it's again I my opinion is that it's benefitting a small population it's benefitting folks that already have homes can already buy down under current legislation that's been in\nEffect for Thirty years um why are we giving those folks this additional benefit let let's go ahead and expand that to everyone if if it's not a problem I mean\nI Would travel okay with that I Would much rather see\nThe I Would much rather see this kind of property tax savings put on the other end of the spectrum let's do something for new home buyers\nOkay but it's still tax savings it's still a tax cut why why argue against that I mean I I've always I've always viewed when you're given a chance to vote on a bill\nThat cuts taxes do it and if someone wants to argue cut taxes more fine we'll come back and do more I mean why why not take a tax cut this is a good thing\n[noise] you know I I totally get that I totally get that argument I I just think that there's better ways that we could spend our money are\nI think there's there's there's better places to put these tax savings if you want to give somebody attacked savings give it to the first time homeowners don't give it to the people who are in some cases can actually buy up\nAnd move their tax base over\nOur age apples and he's a property
