the city and it really is a crap all because it has feces all over the ground we've talked about that at length and not just calling it names it's reality\nSan Francisco chronicle has a headline Republicans put gas tax repeal on ballot now they're walking away\nI'm okay hold on a second that's misleading headline on several accounts first Republicans in California did not put ... the gas tax repeal on the ballot voters did\nAnd in fact having run the campaign and knowing the signatures pretty damn well half of the signatures came from independents and Democrats so don't give me this garbage San Francisco chronicle I Know you guys are liberal\nI Know that you are part of the fake news ah industry\nIt was put on the ballot by ... million Californians who signed a petition and half of those signatures came from Democrats and independents\nThat what they're saying is that we um are short on money\nWell that's true you can say that it's a David versus Goliath fight\n'em you know what they're saying is that the Republican Party gave a nearly a million dollars for the signature qualification effort that's true I asked\nSeveral members of Congress who are Republican if they would be willing to match the grassroots donations we receive we raised and we're continuing to raise more than three million dollars\nA year from over twenty five thousand donors many of whom are independent Republican some Democrats\nAverage donation thirty seven dollars\nAnd yes we did get some funding for paid signature efforts during the signature qualification phase since we qualified it we haven't gotten big contributions from anybody\nAnd you know what that's you know I I I guess that's how things are because Republican elected officials are focused on you know their own races\nI don't fault them for that um I Do fault the business groups for standing on the sidelines or giving against us I mean people don't really give a report by the taxpayer to you you're just going to pass on the higher cost us aren't you\nSo this fight this big fight is up to you and me the grass roots\nAnd uh you know the San Francisco chronicle points out that our opponents the Jerry Brown Sacramento mafia special interest they've got thirty million dollars race so far there on their way to forty million\nWe have about two point four million raised we're on our way to three million my wife say on

um they pay for the ads and in fact on Monday\nWere buying ads on cocoa were buying ads out across the state of California by the way it's not just on pogo everywhere um\nAnd uh maybe because we're
