be given a fair shake nobody\nIs going to say who knew I don't think so remember the Democrats love to grab like mom and apple pie a in stand behind it and say it's just an investigation it's just

... you shouldn't be outraged at what the Democrat Party is doing\n\nWas Dr Ford given a fair shake no she was outed she was manipulated and used if you agree that she's a victim in all this\n\nLet's assume that she is quote a victim that she thinks that she actually was attacked by Brett Kavanaugh but it's not a figment of our imagination it may actually be a fig none of our imagination but she's not line she was not treated fairly her wishes were not\nAdhere to she wasn't even told the truth about whether she'd be able to testify remotely they lied to her her own attorney's lied to her attorney is paid for by the Democrat Party attorneys suggested by the Democrat committee\nSo she wasn't treated fairly and let's talk about Brett Kavanaugh is he being treated failing fairly hell's no no fairness there because you know what the Democrat Party in twenty Eighteen believes that due process is dead and that you are guilty\nUntil proven innocent\nAnd the Republicans are not arguing how that is unacceptable and not what America is all about\nSo if we can reframe this discussion from the standpoint of it is unfair and the Democrat Party vision of America is fun of them are

Hill\nHe came into the office any daddy who put ... on my book\nAnd the reason why that and the other one long ... dong silver or was that ... long silver right something like that these are all meant to demean the individual the Democrats are trying to make you feel icky\nIt's all about describing what's going on so it's demeaning to the individual they're deemed humiliating their their humiliating them\nUm and so the the coke is up there as a a psychological tool to hearken back to ah ah\nThe Anita Hill\nWho again had those substantiate ... her allegations Yeah Dr Ford basically doing the same damn crap but they're trying to say it's just like when Anita Hill said the same thing\nYou know what the cabinet is not Judge Thomas\nIt's why in the second accusation it was he took his penis out and dangled it in my face the reason why that description is provided\nIs that they want to humiliate cabinet and they want to give you the X factor ooh rose that shouldn't be put in people's faces unless they want it and she said and I did not want it and I never wanted to touch another one of those until I got married I mean it's so graphic and descriptive I don't believe these people\nIt's scripted so that you're humiliating but the target you're trying to smear\n\nNow put yourself in Kavanaugh shoes you're being you've worked your life or to be good to do everything right to raise a good family the of two daughters you coach their basketball team or little league team or you have an impeccable reputation as a journalist\n\nGet nominated a Supreme Court he goes through hearings where they're pouring through documents were they they were were they splice the tape so it looks like you're against birth control they're caught on that then you got the whole Spartacus I really think of it as well documents and there was nothing in them\nSo they you go to the hearings you you basically are dealing with people who do not care about your qualifications they're voting against you anyway it's frustrating but whatever I probably got the votes\nAnd then they resort to this you're pervert your sexual predator wouldn't anger you\nWouldn't humiliate you would it make you feel upset do would you feel like the process was a sham of course any human being any reasonable person would have the feeling that this is a crappy\nMove on the part of the Democrats eleventh hour ... how do you defend yourself how do you prove a negative it's very hard you only to view that were in their thirty six years ago were you in the accuser but you know what's interesting I'm not getting into Ford's lack of credibility\nWait for hours and they have no bread and so we said look look into the DMV and what's going on here what did we find [laughter]\nThey are diverting the car tax away from roads one point two billion dollars of car registration fees are being diverted by the DMV from the car tax fund into the general fund we were able to prove it and get the legislative analysts office to release the information\nSecond second\nNine million dollars of your gas taxes being siphoned off to pay for the DMV to process these items\nIt's like well hold on so you're taking carjacked money and you're diverting it away from the roads and then on top of that you're taking gas tax money and diverting into the DMV to deal with their ineptitude why do they get a budget\nThey don't deserve a reward they don't deserve more money we need to fix the incompetence the broken process these they're\nSo today we did nine press conferences highlighting these issues and we tell people you can't trust the state government with a penny more of your money the car taxes bad the gas tax hike is bad vote yes on ...\n\nWe got to get the message out my friends I'm worried about this

being criticized by senator Coons for being emotional for being aggressive\nI think it's absolutely reasonable his response is reasonable he's resolute he is emotional because he's been treated so poorly he's been deprived of the presumption of innocence he hasn't been given due process he's been unfairly smeared\nThey're accusing him of engaging in gang rape for God's sakes\n\nSaturday Night live always wanted to pile on [noise]\nHere's the skits that everyone was talking about Sunday and Monday Matt Damon playing the role of judge Kaplan I listen to it [noise]\nI bet you do about fame

of Doritos [laughter]\nEnough enough so you're making fun of a guy who's been smeared okay I have criticized Dr Ford for not being very credible I've criticized the process for taking her accusation\nAnd basically pumping it up into a complete indictment and verdict by a jury just because she said it it therefore it's true what I have not done is mocked\nOr made fun of for it because you know what I think something could have happened to her I pointed out the weaknesses in her story a marker so if it comes out that she lied about the whole thing oh [laughter]\nI Will have lots of fun with that for the time and I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt but no benefit of the doubt is given to Kevin ... coming up the\nFBI has interviewed an important witness in this whole
