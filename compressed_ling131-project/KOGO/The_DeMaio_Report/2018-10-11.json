saying he's going to work these people out he's referring to administration positions\n\nNot to his inner circle in the west wing because those people don't require Senate confirmation ... you know I Know that Trump has got to be waiting on sessions because he's been told by the Republicans have you fire sessions before the election the mid term election is going to hurt us\nIn a if you want to avoid getting engaged in the house and then the ... and being convicted in the Senate don't do it until after the election and it looks like he is a loud cooler heads to prevail\nI'm he's going to wait until after the election\nThat's what everyone in Washington the same um\nPartly because he would have to get so unconfirmed but not the west wing the west wing he can get rid of those people immediately you're gone and he can replace them immediately 'cause they're not Senate confirmed\nVery interesting [noise] alright coming up we're going to switch gears Jew our ballot here in

app andme listen anytime anywhere too demarco report content we were we we covered it all during the three thirty to four Fifteen segment yesterday\nOkay ah let's talk about the census oh I Know ah [laughter]\nI just want to cover this before we get into the ... the the ballot measure um the or the voter guide\nThe liberals and California are saying that if we don't\nUm changed the census questions that the Trump Administration has put together that we could lose several house seats and of course that\nGets a lot of people's attention because look you know we want California to have as big a voice as possible we want to make sure that every state has\nTheir fair share of I'm not only presidential outdoors but also a member of Congress\nAnd so what the public policy Institute of California has raised is that a California's is is open to an undercount in the twenty twenty somethings census that could take one point six million people out\nOf the calculation which means we would lose about two point two house seats in the process every house seat in worth you know you know six hundred seven hundred thousand people so uh is is a concern yes but what if you do dig deeper you'll find why\nYou see the census is going to ask people are you a legal citizen are you an illegal immigrant are you here legally are you a citizen and what\nAre the liberals are worried about is if you go to someone's door because the constitution says that we have to have an actual count of everybody that's why people go door to door it's an old fashioned\nA way of counting people blow because that's what the constitution requires and I actually I don't mind that you know more precise I Would say but anyway uh they're going to ask on the survey\nHow many people are in the home or they all citizens or they'll you know or you know or do they have jobs we get a lot of information from the census is not just a few questions it's a pretty in depth review\nWell they're afraid that if they're asked about anyone in the household that's not a citizen that\nThe person at the door will skip over that individual and so therefore you might have a an undercount of the people actually living in the state of California I don't mind that at all here's why\nI don't think that congressional districts should be apportioned based on illegal immigrants I Know the old fashioned and here's the thing I don't think the founding fathers anticipate at a time when we would have a porous border the only mention of\nIndividuals living in the United states\nThat were not citizens ah it was a very\nDark chapter in our history of slavery and it said that will will count the slaves is two thirds of a person towards the census and therefore towards representation but they're not allowed to vote\nWe still can the women even though they weren't allowed to vote again we've got some dark chapters in our history we've been able to overcome thank goodness but the founding fathers didn't anticipate these people coming from Syria and\nYou know uh Germany or who I Am not just picking on Syria Mexico China everywhere Timbuktu they didn't anticipate a porous border\nAnd so right now the Supreme Court has interpreted the um census the counting of people in the disk redistricting as every individual whether they're a legal immigrant or an illegal immigrant whether they are a citizen or non citizen\nAgain I don't want to make it based on registered voters because some people don't want to register to vote that's fine they still deserve a to count towards population district thing\nAnd uh you know a a a should have a voice represented\nBut illegal immigrants who are not citizens no we don't count towards the allocation of congressional seats in electors coming up measure el would raise the salaries of city council members by double by double do they deserve a pay hike that's on the demand report first traffic\nHere Sandy Avon dealers traffic center south on the tree

compensation for both the mayor and the city council\nUm by more than double what they're paid already\nAn eighty five percent salary increase would be an acted in twenty twenty and more than a hundred percent salary increase by twenty twenty two\nI Would be indexed as a percentage of what judges are paid in the state of California right now a council members are in about Seventy five thousand dollars plus benefits and the mayor gets about a hundred thousand dollars plus benefits\nJoining me on the report in in support of measure el is Bob ... he's a local attorney and he was the former chair of the salary setting commission for the city of San Diego Bob thanks for stopping by\nThanks for having me on okay so let's let's explain how things are currently done currently the a
