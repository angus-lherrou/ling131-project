of what the media has been saying\nFor days that Donald Trump is inciting violence against the media and Democrats that it's terrible and this is why you ought to vote\nDemocrat that's basically their message OK I'm not I'm not exaggerating that's their message now Donald Trump came out today it was very clear and he has been very clear ah since these packages were first intercepted I'll listen to audio on\nWe've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find that person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI've instructed authorities to spare no resource or expense and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [noise]\nOkay um now earlier in the day the president started his morning with a and this is before the arrest and the announcement that they had found the guy uh with this tweet Republicans are doing so well in early voting and\nThe polls and now this quote bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what is going on Republicans go out and vote\n[noise] okay he's being criticized for I'm saying that the media is focusing on the bombs stuff\nThat's true they are I don't know if he's saying that um they're wrong to focus on the bomb stuff is just simply saying that's the focus and a Republicans either remember that they need to get out and about\nI don't think he is downplaying the bomb a issue you just heard him we will spare no expense this is not acceptable\nWe don't condone violence what he's trying to do is continue to get people to understand that we need to get out and vote\nDon't see this is diminishing it now has he come out saying that this is some sort of conspiracy\nNo no he basically said hey we got the guy and the law enforcement did a good job\nJust so happens to be a fringe Republican who supports him now are we going to sit around and say that ah\nSomeone committing crimes who's a supporter of someone or somehow was inspired or someone someone um who commits a crime who's a supporter of Hillary Clinton somehow should be um a blamed on Hillary Clinton\nNow of present certainly doesn't happen in a in the media when that happens on the Democrats' side\nBut it does happen and it hasn't been the chorus on the Republican side I don't think either is legitimate what are your thoughts eight hundred six hundred Togo eight hundred six hundred and five six for six um some of the people who know this ah says our guy\nThey are um they're speaking out the media is probably gonna find a whole lot more out about this guy a but a an old manager of his says quote he was crazed\nAnd that's the best word for him there was something really off with him\nOr he actually used as van to deliver pizzas\nOr and the manager described it uh that inside there were quote puppets with their heads cut off mannequins with their heads cut off Ku Klux Klan a black person being hung anti gay symbols torching bombings you name it it was all over his truck in the inside\nOkay can I ask a very simple question why would you employ this person they are clearly a ticking time bomb bomb do you not have an HR director who would advise you uh yeah this is not going to be the employee of the month\n[laughter]\nI I this manager be admitting this\nYeah yeah yeah I knew the guy worked for me for a while and boy he was delivering pizzas for me in the house of horrors\n\nAnother coworker said quote he was very angry and angry at the world that blacks and Jews and gays he always talked about it if I had complete autonomy none of these days are these blacks would survive\nHe never said he would kill them or murder them or a bomb that is that if I had complete autonomy the gays the blacks the Jews would not survive\nHe was very very strange [laughter]\nAgain that the reason why I'm giving you some of these uh accounts and I read you as wrap sheet which a bombing back in a bomb threat back in two thousand two appears on the rap sheet is that what you hear the media tonight blame Donald Trump for this\nReally the guy was in that case years ago\n\nWhat would incite someone could it be\nThat he's incited by what he hears and sees from Democrats rather than what he hears and sees from Donald Trump\nLet me just I'm just put that out there what insights him more Donald Trump winning\nUh what Democrats are pushing right now on this whole CNN [noise] I I Believe it was all they knew that I listen to you every day for my new and it just disappointed me a little bit that\nI just kept sharing you in on it but I just you know we needed to know the fact that we know the fact\nWell not as I got to go in and I wanted to give you a chance to articulate your point of view the good thing about my shows we do pod cast so I wouldn't I Would very much encourage you to listen to that show\nUh yesterday in the day before because I was very clear what I was responding to is the media before we knew who this was they immediately said Trump's\n... this is coming from some a fringe guy on the right or look it's either someone from the left or the right so you have a fifty fifty chance but they'd already made a decision and so when I was laying out was hold on I was laying out before we we condemn Donald Trump and before we go in the ... include that it is a Republican who did this\nThere's an equally good chance that this is someone from the left and I'm taking the left to task for the very behavior they're criticizing Donald Trump you know what I call that Marco I call it fairness I call it pumping the brakes sane hold on hold on\nLet me explain why it actually could be that all these packages targeting Democrats could actually be from a Democrat so before we make any judgments\nI Want to see an investigation and I'm open to it either being so on the left or the right but if I were to bet right now my money if I were forced to bat my money would be on the on on the left\nAnd I still I still I still would believe that if if another example came up tomorrow I Would still bet on the left why because I've seen people on the left encouraging active mob violence I've not seen that on the right no matter what Donald Trump says about you know pop 'em back in the face that they pop you\nDon't interpret that as hint legitimizing someone taking an initiating violence against another individual that's just what I'm saying\nI don't have any I don't live in that any of the ... I\nI Do I Do because I I didn't know what they're saying [laughter]\nI get it that much for me and to too much and um\nI live in a rush shot of everyone I I'm a Democrat though but it it bothered me that every single conservative talk radio what they think the ... and ... you know that\nNo no no no no no no again I don't know about other other shows that I don't have time to listen to them [noise] um I Do watch CNN from time to time just because I Need to know what the hell they're pumping out there uh my Democrat partner says would you please turn that off because he can't stand CNN either but to the point\nMy two shows two days in a row were all about pumping the brakes on before you slam Donald Trump recognize that the only people I've seen thus far calling for violence has been coming from the left and I played those clips both Hillary Clinton Eric Holder mad Maxine waters\nUh we've covered the comments from Philippe Reines or a weekend to go\nAnd I also pointed out I'll I'll I'll share with the Democrats have dug up against Donald Trump I played that a an audio and all those clips were from the context of people coming into his rallies\nInciting violence and what he was saying as hey you can you can stand up for yourself all back yeah I'll pay your legal bills if you if you stand up for yourself\nOr against someone who comes into this rally and starts to cause trouble I'll back you up that's a lot different than mad Maxine waters saying go out and find people in their private spaces and give them no no comfort no rest but they don't deserve to have a a private life\nOr or Hillary Clinton saying that we don't have to be civil until we're back in power or Hillary Clinton saying the only language the damage or the Republicans can speak is the is the language of strength and that's what we have to show them um again all this stuff\nIs I Believe or not not not acceptable in our in our public dialogue\nAnd if Trump says something that's on the line you know I call 'em out and I get grief from Trump supporters I just tried to call them like it is but the past few days I've said until we know who it is stop assuming it's one side of the other end I marshalling for you\nThe reason why it could be someone from the left even though people on the left are the ones being targeted that's why we went through a our discussion yesterday and the day before appreciate your calling in and listen to the broadcast if you disagree listen to the broadcast I think it was very clear about it every step of the white [noise]\nUm I Do want to pay off on the uh\nPictures on the the white van this guy was such a ... I'm a ... wait to hear some of the things that he put on the side of his van and and and this ban has been photographed and other places because people in the public and members of the media thought he was creepy\nI'm driving around in a ... we got a picture of the van before it was covered up that's on the report first traffic\nFrom the San Diego county credit union traffic center he's been Ninety four so tough right out of downtown from the five to ... because of an earlier crash he found aid is it twenty seven minute drive from the five as he su you'll be in and out of traffic the whole stretch East I'm fifty two twenty three minutes from ... to mask\nOn north down Fifteen before a fallacy that as a crash in the center lane traffic it back to the city to an accident has the left lane block the south on Fifteen at the aid traffic stop and go from one sixty three I'm Laura came because next real time traffic that they did that for oh three\nSo you know I did also in addition to my glass of wine I fired up my ... last night uh I'm so enjoying my pool and it really does fit the San Diego lifestyle or you work hard you get to play hard\nPools are just such a perfect fit for San Diego and if you've been thinking about a pool I Want you to consider doing your project with San Diego pools they were honest sincere and direct with me they gave me fixed price budgeting\nThey committed a certain price and they stuck to it no surprises the quality has been great and the service exceptional anytime we've had an issue they come out and take care of it above and beyond above and beyond what we expect\nRight now they have the twenty Eighteen pricing but pricing will go up next year so do a free consultation consultation with them today\nThey do have a free design offer where they will show you what your pool could look like and the price they'll give you a fixed price and they will guarantee the twenty teen pricing if you agree or make you agreement today that ...

into the energy utility business they want to compete with as the G any now make no mistake about it I Do not like as the DNA and I wish we have competition I Wish we had a competition\nLong time ago I don't think government should be the competition I think we should have a nonprofit or a for profit come into the market and do a some competition\nAnd I think they would be successful I think it would be good for consumers why does government have to do this here is mayor Kevin Faulkner announcing his a crazy scheme\nWe can leave a cleaner city for the next generation and create economic benefits for our region dude a cleaner city why don't you deal with the homeless population and clean up the poop that has been piling up on your watch how 'bout that buddy\n... you're the audacity to

clean city clean up the poop deal with the homeless epidemic deal with the syringes that are being found in parks Mr\nBut what he's proposing is that we actually start a government run government

besides the city for competition against the utility All right we don't have to\nHave a new government bureaucracy with gold plated a government pensions and all those political patronage jobs people who are in nap at doing the basic functions of the city should not be rewarded with a new bureaucracy in a commercial enterprise\nThis is not going to end well here's a ten news describing how this

choice system the city would buy energy just sell directly to residents as the genie would still deliver that energy and bill Sandy a against but locals would pay the city for the electricity portion instead of utility owned by scent brought a fortune five hundred company\n[noise] gotcha so we're basically creating a government middle man do you see how that works the city buys electricity from the market where do you think SAG and he gets electricity they buy it they also produce it through their mother company separate but they buy energy as well\nThey turn around and they sell it to us so what city is proposing is they're going to buy the electricity\nThey're going to then deliver it through as the genie is lines\nWell actually F. D. J. and he's going to deliver it to you a and the city will take a nice and ministry of cuts how about we do this how about we just simply say that a private enterprise or nonprofit can be established can be invited in to compete\nAnd that they share the cost of the transmission lines with Esther Jeanie and then they go they bid for our\nCustomer portfolio\nThey they offer us rates they compete and
