something anti Semitic just the other\nDay he did it was in the news um we didn't even put it on our show a rundown because well frankly we're talking about Louis Farrakhan I Know Donald Trump responded to the blame game\nHe tweeted out earlier today the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatism me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country actually it is they're fake and dishonest reporting which\nIs causing problems far greater than they understand\nHe went on to say there's great anger in our country cause in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop\nThe open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately unfairly that will do much to put out the flame\nI I agree with Trump on this I I mean if you want to talk about again\nDon't take the blame away from the folks that did these heinous acts I'm not only talking about the synagogue shooting\nBut also uh the um the mail um um terrorists typical male terrorist bombs in I'll go off but it is terrorism it was designed to intimidate and harass people [noise] um\nBut\nWhen you take a look at the the discord that's here\nIs fake news\nNow I've seen fake news on both sides by the way I've seen Republican fake news but if you're a hell of a lot more democratic fake news it's called MSNBC CNN at New York's limes Washington chose to cetera Elyse limes we're dealing with fake news and the ... campaign it is disgusting it is\nOutrageous the link to it should news or the ... media journalists have gone to cover up the theft of gas taxes so it angers us it angers the volunteers\nThey're frustrated there'd be like do they know that their neighbors are being lied to people don't like that they don't look kindly on it and and the reason why I think Trump is was raised in this is that if the if the media is sitting there making criticism\nOf people you know do good enough job ... to ... you're responsible\nLike you you're one of the most cancerous elements of our society here the fake news media you lie to people you tend to be journalists and yet you have a partisan agenda\nWhat a bad actor decides to try to criticize you for something that frankly is not a legitimate criticism\n\nIt was Richard but the reality is\nWe have a Second Amendment ... you just get someone\nBelieves and freedom and actually believes that the\nRight of self defense actually is good for public safety [noise] um does not make them complicit in a murder\nA person who carried out the violence they are responsible for the murder\n\nBut never let a tragedy passed without politicizing it\nGot to make sure we take\nThe blame and throw it right at the feet of congressional Republicans but I mean they're they're they're they're trying to figure out who do we go with a gun control narrative that doesn't usually work too well or let's just go after Trump beat him up he's the blame\n\nAnd we got Sarah Sanders so serious Sanders was a defending Trump or from these attacks somehow he was responsible\nInspiring the synagogue shooting listening\nNo president's not it's not responsible for these acts to again the very first action that the president did was condemn\nThese heinous acts the very first thing that the media did was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president but everybody that works in this administration\nThe major news networks first public statement what's to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out in the ground would hold that responsibility\n[noise] now the rabbi Jeffrey Maier shut the synagogue\nA delivered to a

of the other it was for both sides\nUm in some of the stuff that's been out there has been just over the top just hysterical\nOr not in a funny way but it's just you know the Salem witch hysteria you know everyone's so sensitive\nSo you know that obviously with just a few days after the election there's a lot of money being spent Michael Bloomberg Tom Sawyer and George Soros and then pouring billions collectively into politics hundreds of millions of the cycle\nI'm how's majority leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted\nOver the weekend quote\nWe cannot allow Soros dire and Bloomberg to buy this election get out and vote Republican November six\nAnd there's a picture of Soros\nWell because the three of these individuals are from Jewish heritage\nThe media basically blasted Kevin McCarthy as being anti Semitic as being insensitive and the the face of the uh uh I'm a shooting\nFirst let me tell you I I Will guarantee you he did not write this tweet\nYesterday or the day before or the day before that it's all pre program say\nUm secondly I don't find it anti Semitic\nI find it anti liberal I find it anti billionaire I find it anti big money in politics do not I do not find it and I said anyone who wants to accuse him of being insensitive or anti Semitic you're just being hateful okay you're you're basically doing what the rabbi has encouraged not to do\nGrandstanding and politicizing taking things out of context there you go you're not there to educate people you're there to divide people\nAnd distorts perfect example of what we're talking about\nAnd these are members of the media during this much as ... the Democrats members of media slammed him unfortunately McCarthy deleted the tweet as though he did something wrong you didn't do anything wrong dude\nFunny things is my name is hyphenated\nOn my new real ID it's also hyphenated but the card that has me as a new voters says my name is\nFirst name middle initial\nCorrosion now her last name as Rosen but\nHer vote new voter registration that she has in addition to the one that she really has is for a corrosion\nK O R oh sorry K O R O s E N you what they did the DMV somehow took the last two letters of her maiden name\nAnd shoved them on the front of her married name and created a whole brand new voter\nThat doesn't really exist this voter should not exist but there's voter is is getting about this voter is getting a permanent absentee ballot so this voter here is going to get a real ballot and a second real ballot\nThey're going to get a ballot that they're eligible for and then they're going to get a second ballot that they're not eligible for\nThis is how screwed up our system is I'll grant you [noise] uh this is an an unintentional and an unintentional voter registration she got registered by the DMV erroneous ally\nBut of course we've brought you the story of tens of thousands of erroneous voter registration that have happened\nPeople receiving ballots two ballots three ballots yes you brought that story two weeks ago three ballots for one guy and it's the same thing where the name was kind of screwed up on two of them\nI'm Glad that these people are honest enough not to return\nThe ballots but I don't think everybody\nHas that same sense of duty and honesty\nAnd then we find out that four hundred and forty nine thousand illegal immigrants are registered to vote in the state of California you heard that right for a hundred and forty nine thousand the legal immigrants are registered to vote\nBut media doesn't want to cover it now and there's nothing wrong with our voting they'll it's all pristine it's all good it's rotten to the core there's no integrity here Trump is actually\nRight but you don't want to actually covered the damn story because you're afraid you're going to give him validation and that would just hurt yeah it would burn like the holy oil a holy water and The Exorcist movie\nAnd so we are doing Halloween do you have my little audio you don't have my audio or that we had this permanent audio oh she's back oh here she comes open the door go in the bedroom and you can guess what you see\n[laughter]\nYou guys ever heard that in la\nYou know why you haven't heard that a long time I haven't dipped into their view\nOn ABC\nI haven't played been at least four or five months I've just been too busy with prop six\nBut the the point being in the media is covering up\nThe union buffoon the LA slime seems\nThey're all covering up the biggest story of voter fraud that we're seeing\nIn our generation and it's intentional\nBottom part of the media it's also intentional on the part of the Democrats who cram through bills knowing that they were going to completely destroy any internal controls on who gets to register to vote and how we\nPolice it because that's what they want in from the get go make no mistake this is not just ineptitude this is by design coming up Hillary Clinton\nConfirms she's running

org that San Diego election guide dot org\nLet's turn our attention to the schools are schools in San Diego county well most of the school districts aren't meeting the mark and the poster child of bad behavior is San Diego Unified School district to those schools in the city of San Diego\nAnd we've got a border to border to directors or that currently I'm is completely controlled by the teachers unions and the government unions they don't serve the city or the or the kids of the city\nThey serve their union masters was higher salaries and benefits and bureaucracies bigger bureaucracies we got to change that and that's why our next two guests\nWould be a great addition to the San Diego school board we got Marcia Nordstrom and Tom killing annoying they're both running for San Diego Unified School district in two separate district so you can vote for them each and uh you know pick up two seats\nMarshall is start out with you while you're running\nI'm running because uh our kids are our future\nAnd that may be a very simple statement but you know what it's a really powerful statement because everything that we do a lot of things that we do try our life revolves around our kids whether it be our job how much we make where we you know what ... what we do for our vacation where we live\nSo you know these are really big decisions that are everyday decision and it all starts with our kids and making sure that they get the best education\nTom your your reason for running\nMy reason is I think our educational community deliberate poor and it's not meeting the age of particularly\nUh students of color African American students Latino students and Pacific Islanders the California Department of education in spite of what this district says with a Ninety One percent graduation rate proves that they're failing our community in education\nIn English language arts with a thirty five percent failure rate and it gets worse with math at sixty three percent it's an abysmal failure\nNow both of your opponents are backed by the labor unions they both voted for tax hikes a major massive big bombs\nAnd of course they've not been able even in good times with good revenue flows to balance the budget\nOr they continue to give away the store um is this classically as they've described it uh you've got these board members that you're running against completely doing the bidding of the unions was no regard for the kids are Tom let's start out with you\n[noise] ah well I've been saying all along that ah we've already voters a six point four million dollars and bond funding that's supposed to go to\nFixing facilities lead in a lot of asbestos in our school site by the way based on district records there's a hundred and eighty one school site so if you do the math it's a tremendous amount of money\nWorst yet sixty five percent of that bond money goes to investors not the schools so\nIt's no surprise the needle going back to the well and saying hey measure why why give us another three and a half billion dollars even though we have to point one billion left\nWe need more it's just outrageous ... time someone stood up and and I stood up for taxpayers imperiled and said enough is enough re prioritize spending re prioritize fixing actually fixing\nIssues with the two point one billion you have left\nIn ... county alone\nAnd more and Marcia your take on on the ... the union stranglehold on these ... these these ... the school board members\nClub you know we have five trusting\nAnd there's a common thread among the five trustees and that they are either all endorsed or supported by the labor union\nSo they're they're special interests and our special interest\nIf the kids are not endorsed by in union I'm endorsed by parents by groups who won the better schools better education because as Tom said it it's well known that the schools are failing most of our kids\n... six is missed titled it's an error unintentional errors to deceive you vote yes on prop six to repeal the gas tax that they are uncertain about it just read it it's just three sentences long the actual initiative\n[noise] and so that's number one number two\nIn addition to beating the drum we said that if prop ... fails we are going to do a recall of the attorney general\nHobby Airbus Sarah Columbus, Georgia he's trashy take 'em out diamond Jake ... out take the trash out take 'em out through a recall we have to collect signatures in order to do that but we're pretty good at collecting finishers were pretty good at recalling elected officials\nAnd so we are ready to do a recall if we fail I don't think we're going to fail I think perhaps X is going to pass but I wanted to put ... on the uh the the the notice I notice that we will take him out of office if necessary\nWe will take him out of office now standing next to me when we made this announcement that we were planning to recall ... if he wins and if prop six loses was judge Steven Bailey and he's running for attorney general he joins me on the demand reports Stephen thanks so much for stopping by\nA thank you for having me [noise] so they are joining us at the press conference today I Know you're busy are out there are doing\nThe campaigns wings are different parts of the state tell us why you agree that Sarah is a lying to voters with this a prop six title\nOr you know the a prop six it's such a simple initiative that I'm anyone who wants to read it understands\nIt repealed the gas tax repeal for car tax and prevent for politicians from raising our taxes for car and gas tax in the future it doesn't take more than that to tell the voters what the initiative does\nAnd to ah create this confusing mix of words uh mislead the voters is tantamount to want it wine to the voters and to it it's criminal I don't know how to put it\nYou know I don't even get squat XYZ outright criminal it's it's an attempt to defraud people of their votes\nIt absolutely is and that's what's so upsetting about the politicians and Sacramento or they think they can tell us anything that we're going to believe it\nOr that we will allow them to run roughshod over if Californians are quite frankly fed up with the politician from Sacramento we want change and we want change right now\nSo obviously I've encouraged people to vote for you over ... but the reason why I think we have to be ready to do a recall is if we lose ... and if you lose the attorney general's race because\nYou know for the first three weeks of this campaign whole lot of people were not aware that our attorney general decided to lie to all of us I think that when they wake up after the election and realize they were lied to I think that\nA guy and they will regret not only their do vote on prop six being duped into will know when they wanted to do yes but they're also very much regret their vote for ...\nAnd I think that that does create the foundation for the recall\nI agree I agree but we still haven't we want to vote yes on prop six and and and the message loud and clear to the politicians in Sacramento and to to vote for judge Steven Bailey for attorney general for that we have\nUm a fair objective analysis of these initiatives that are coming down ones that are going to be I'm straight on an honest and not this kind of lying that's going on in Sacramento\nI totally agree and then in addition to being good on the ballot titles and summaries and doing a a fair and impartial job\nYou're great when it comes to law and order you're not going to be suing the Trump Administration you're just gonna be doing your job is the state attorney general and you're really good at making sure that we put a law abiding a residence interests first not the criminals interest and I appreciate that hey Stephen and what's your website so people can join up with your campaign\nIt's W. W. W. dot Bailey for age ... dot com that's be a high L. E. Y. F. O. R. A. G. dot com\n[noise] All right thanks so much judge Steven Bailey vote for him for state attorney general he's with us on the prompts six effort and he agrees it's criminal what they've done in miss title ing intentionally miss tightly linked to deceive on prop six vote yes on prop six to repeal the gas tax spread the word make sure people know that there is an error\nOn the ballot there is an air on the ballot\nProps six was intentionally\nMislabeled they wanna do view mislead you\nYou want to repeal the gas tax ... is the gas tax repeal vote yes to repeal the gas tax you got to kind of explain it that way you got to break it down into the simple simple little items that people can understand yes equals gas tax repeal on ... yes on six join our effort that gas tax repealed\nOr coming up we'll we gotta talk about the shooting at the synagogue and the blame game that has resulted unfortunately lots of troops are coming to the border to secure it as that migrant caravan\nIs winding its way of Mexico and are we really fixing roads in San Diego and that's what the politicians want us to believe not so that's one of the mile report for traffic\nRight now on the sounds down the side of the five a little tight from Washington street all the way down to the corner how to bridge south ... south through ... at Emory ranch and he said he rides typing and wants to see three chili Fifteen\nAnd also we do have a crash that his on that sixty seven around play they're trying to figure that out right now from east sound fifty two", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The DeMaio Report", "city": "San Diego", "day": "29"}
