recently as we've been traveling all around the state of California for yes on prop six\nI'm I've been in a lot of other airports as well and San Diego airport it's one of the better ones and it's actually you know I mean look there are improvements that certainly can be made but I think it's one of the better ones yes we need a new terminal one um it's\nFifty years old I mean think about it a building that's fifty years old an airport millions of passengers flowing through every single year\nThen of course those big big planes are all sorts of stuff going on there and of course you know it's starting to show its age on terminal one the one thing I'd like to see is most of that traffic diverted over the five I think we ought to go all in on the inter model transportation center on the high five\nThat's where the trolley stops\nWhere we should be having people park their cars\nCheck their bags and then they can be ferried over the other side I originally had proposed that we

California's want they took a red pen and they struck out that title\nAnd they put in repeals road repairs and that is a lie nothing in our initiative does that\nAnd in fact uh we show how the gas tax money or or the ... are actually being diverted from roads\nOr they should be putting the money to roads they're not and if you put all the gas tax money into roads at the lower rate after we get yes on prop sex you could actually increase funding for road repairs by two point three billion dollars a year without a tax increase that's how much money these politicians are stealing from us\nAnd that's not even talking about the waste fraud and abuse of six figure salaries that Caltrans fifty seven percent um Caltrans employees earn a hundred thousand dollars or more the average salary as a

increases in the state of California since Nineteen Seventy eight when prop Thirteen was put into place\nProperty tax revenues have increased by four hundred and eighty percent don't give me a ... percent above\nCost of living yeah four hundred and eighty per cent above cost of living so that includes cost of living and then give these politicians four hundred and eighty percent more prop Thirteen is not putting government on starvation diets it's getting more than enough money okay but not according to me I'm Gayle in the LA Times [noise]\nI'm a liberal and I love tax increases and I call myself a journalist but I'm going to lie to you because gamut you're not paying enough in taxes\nYou know what if you want to be an editorial writer go ahead and be an editorial writer\nDon't ... tried to pretend that you're a journalist gives you or not\nBut if we don't succeed from six\nIf we don't win the yes on prop six vote he realized prop Thirteen is within their each chipped to repeal it right\nThe Democrats the super majority the uh the special interests that they will be so in bold and\nThat they can slap a misleading title on the repeal of prop Thirteen and voters are going to
