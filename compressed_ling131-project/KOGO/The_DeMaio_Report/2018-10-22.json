in the illegal voting their facilitating it they are doing motor voter their registering\nAre illegal immigrants driver's licenses and automatically registering them to vote this is a sham so don't you dare say Mr President that all levels of government I Would say some levels of government are interested in stopping out voter fraud but not the state of California for sure\nEarlier today the media or decided to give the ... the president a hard time on this topic as though he's crazy that no illegal voting is happening\nUm which is quite humorous given all the recent stories out here in

are registered to vote in a state of California with a date of birth older than the oldest person living in a state of California\nAnd the news is that one of those anomalies where they set the birth date to Nineteen hundred or because of the software glitch 'cause I've seen that happen before this is really a one of those things where they have a birth date that's older than the oldest person out there and it's not just January won Nineteen hundred correct\nWell it if if it's some of that's going to be fraud and some of it's going to be a incompetent because California law says\nThere are many things that if you don't fill out on your voter registration they are still to accept it date of birth is not one of them if they have a if they did not have your date of birth it is an invalid voter registration so it's either\nFraudulent and then somebody put picked a random date out there so that they could both fraudulent\nOr somebody dead and they haven't removed and part of the voter roll or

about it I Want to talk about that\nWe just sat on a mark moisture he's running for California secretary of state I encourage you to vote for him because he can clean up the mess with our elections\nBut let me tell you the three ways that illegal votes can be cast the media does not want to look at this well because they liked the candidate to win and the environment of illegal votes ... way number one\nPeople who are not eligible to vote registered to vote that would be illegal immigrants that would be having your I'm I'm a non citizens somehow register to vote and right now we've got that risk with motor voter they automatically get a driver's license and then suddenly they automatically get registered to vote\nYou go to the DMV um you don't\nAnd have to show anything to register to vote it's all on the honor system\nAre also other illegal boats are people registering in a district when they don't really live there and they register to the same address and this is what mark Morris or it was just talking about you know want to dress having forty ballots reading mailed to it yeah not so good [noise]\nUm another example of that are people who are homeless are eligible to register to vote not at home but just simply saying I live in the park\nWell they register to vote in this election and a lot of those votes are like in the high homeless areas like downtown they say oh I'm I'm I live at father Joe's where I live in the park I live in the canyon their names are still on the ballot\nWhat are you going to give them a mail ballot oh mailed the ballot to the park now they are able to walk in and get a provisional ballot but how do you know that that's the real person can't go back and figure out that they actually have a water bill ... ah you know live at a at a certain place\nVery hard to determine who those people really are who claimed to be homeless so that's number one people who are not eligible to vote who are voting\nNumber two actual illegal votes themselves these are people who are\nWell eligible to vote but there illegally voting this would be an individual who registered to vote but by an error gets ... three ballots I got a text message from a guy named brand and who showed me three separate ballots he got\nThree different versions of his name [noise]\nThree different versions\nOf his first and last name one had his middle initial one had an error in the spelling of his last name\nThree votes one individual three cards then we got a people who are I'm dead voting yes the union Tribune CBS LA just recently did studies showing that illegal immigrants and I'm Sorry a dead people have been voting\nIn some of these elections typically it's a a family member that returns ballot absentee ballot and then finally get changed ballot\nI'm right now there's a new law that allows for Democrats in union members and well you know anyone but the people who do what are Democrats and union members who go door to door and say give me your ballot give me your ballot and then suddenly they take about this you should be illegal you used to have to sign over power of attorney\nIt had to be a blood relative not any more they change the law now if you notice the common theme here\nLaws are being changed to make it easier to commit voter fraud or motor voter\nAccompanied the illegal immigrants get driver's license act and in that act they basically made it a a impossible to prosecute voter fraud by legal immigrants because it said you had to prove intense\nProve that they knowingly registered to vote and knowingly cast in illegal ballots and I said well they're illegal immigrants and they cast about no no no the lawyers tell me that you have to prove that they didn't know that they weren't supposed to vote\nAnd part of the defense as well as they were ... by the government that isn't that the government's fault you see how this is all game\nThe politicians passed these laws inviting making it easier facilitating illegal voting\nBut the change ballot one has to do with the law they pass allowing the harvesting of ballots\nBy voters absentee voters\nThe harvesting of ballots are basically as you go door to door and ask people for their ... I don't know why anyone would give up their ballot but a lot of these people in low income communities\nAre told at the door well I'm with the union I'm with the firefighters are worth the police officers\nWell no you're you're a union go nuts you argue on higher pensions and salaries and you want to increase taxes to pay for it all um but that's what happens what are the three things that we can do to clean up the mess well first we just heard of one of the ideas elect mark Morris or to secretary of state he can do it on it he can fix it you can clean up the mess\nBut in a state of California where there's a lot of illegal voting going on already to blue state it's kinda hard to see that he might be elected it's a long shot possible but a long shot\nSo absent getting a real secretary of state is interested in voter or an election integrity\nThe second thing we need to do\nWind is sue at every turn\nWhen you file every lawsuit we can in federal court saying that are due process rights are being infringed upon\nThat our votes are being diluted and that we demand a federal court order to clean up the mess Democrats are really good at using strategic lawsuits time that Republicans in very brace the notion of taking things to court\nWe we proved that some of those people screaming and yelling during the cabinet hearings were I'm not just members of Congress but they were actually paid protesters because they were caught outside getting their payments from these well funded leftist groups are backed by George Soros\nPaid protesters we also then read the names of the actual lady the woman who uh uh stopped um uh uh play just like in the elevator she was a paid\nSix figure a democratic activist she wasn't just some whoa hello me name you know and ... and I'm just here and I'm just concerned and I'm just a woman now a hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars paid political operative\nDemocratic ah citizenry grassroots my\nRear end well now there is an actual case from Beverly Hills\nOf a firm located up there\nThat is now being accused of extortion in a lawsuit for paying protesters\nIt's called crowds on demand Beverly Hills from and it basically goes after um the business community they organized a protest rallies flash mobs paparazzi event and other inventive PR stunts quote we provide everything including the people materials and even the ideas\nUm the company has hired actors to actually go into city council meetings\nTo testify on behalf of their clients they've protested a masons convention in San Francisco and they are designed to act like supportive fans and ... at LA conferences for life coaches\nYeah so not all of this is politics some of it is just you know creepy\nAnyway a lawsuit filed by a check investor crowds on demand is accused of um uh uh basically\nExtorting people saying that we will have protesters in front of your office in front of your business unless you pay us I'm\nI'm curious to see where this case goes ...\nI like to see more of these cases filed against people who are involved in a these bullying tactics I don't mind if you want to do your own rally you and your your own assembly great but don't hire people to come and disrupt someone else's assembly\nThat's just foul its just rude you're you're you're trying to exercise ... veto\nThis next one is a Republican activists and I don't even know if the Republican they maybe even farther you know right than that but some activists that don't like Nancy Pelosi which would be most of America\nA but these folks took it too far she was doing an event in Florida and a group of people are stopped by her event and that she was yelled at let's listen to some of the uh the the audio that we got\n\nSocialism socks and then they also use the F. word a F ing communist get the F out of here F you and your ...

heart committee to look at the whole thing and the problem is that is that some people want to consider a residential use\nA short term a rental as an illegal you as a non resident business you there are lots of people that use their home I'm as businesses that doesn't make the activity and legal it still being as residential so there was an overreach and they'd overreach was because\nWe haven't

done a lot of great work in Pacific beach people trust him because you are you stopping by a so let's let's talk about this poll then I got this example from a Democrat who says that\nShe has another\nClear example of Democrats being targeted by Republican than a mean way and a bowling anyway I don't agree but all share and see what you think I'm a poll came out over the weekend Los Angeles times that raises concerns for me but it's it's what I've been telling\nI've been telling you is a real problem with affordable housing we've been talking about a a part of it with air being be one of the arguments for banning children vacation rentals is that it takes housing stock out of the market which means that there's less housing available less Reynolds available for long term which means that when supply diminishes well\nThen the cost goes up I agree that that is in part\nNot a big factor but it it does contribute\nMy response to that criticism system is you don't solve that by taking away private property rights from people what you do is you\nAllow people to build you allow the market to create supplied increase supply to meet demand for housing is all about supply demand\nThere's no other factor in it\nThat really drives the solution quicker\nThan supply demand increasing supply\nReducing the cost of supply is also important the regulations on building California's don't seem to understand that\nSo I Want to share with you this fall in the LA Times um when asked what do you think is responsible the top reason or reasons for\nLack of affordable housing\nTwenty eight percent of Californians said\nIt's because we don't ever in control oh my God and rent controls on the ballot this year ... ten boating oh by the way on prop ... rent control\nAs

your fee for mileage\nYes you're already in a bad gas tax and you already have a car tax and now they're going to a mileage tax\nThese people are not going to be satisfied with just the gas and car

or fear tax without a public vote you would have to vote to approve of mileage tax in the state of California if prop six passes it is yet another reason\nWhy you should be voting yes on proposition
