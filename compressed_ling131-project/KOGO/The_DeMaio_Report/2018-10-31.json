sponsored by Nick a dominoes farmers insurance agency\nNow offering pet insurance\nUh why do I have so much confidence that Donald Trump could actually\nSolve this a birthright citizenship a question through an executive order well suppose tomorrow he says no one is going to be given citizenship just by birth right\nWe're going to go to a higher standard which is you have to actually be born in ... to a a ... you know parents who are already citizens or at least one parent\nOkay the first anchor baby\nWhere he denies them citizenship will immediately be represented by the ACLU and some other pet feet organization and they will sue and they will take it all the way up to the Supreme Court and that's why I wanted to share with you the Supreme Court cases because\nUltimately they've got to decide what did the charm\nMean\nWhat did the fourteenth amendment mean those words what did they mean when they were written when it actually was a\nAdded to our constitution well you and I both know the fourteenth amendment came about because we wanted to make it quite clear that slaves a war citizens\nAll persons born or naturalized in United States comma and subject to the jurisdiction thereof comma are citizens of the United states and when they say subject to the jurisdiction there of\nWhat does that me\nIs I mean we can make rules well yes but subject and subject to the jurisdiction thereof means you are a subject of that country\n\nAnd we can make rules as it relates to well are you are so a subject of our country or are you a subject of some other country because your parents are legal citizens of that other country just like we say when a minister or an ambassador a\nAs a baby here in the United states they don't become a citizen we've excluded them how can you exclude them it doesn't say anything in this uh language here about ambassadors that person's a citizen by golly no it's not we have not made them subject to our jurisdiction\n\nAnd the Supreme Court cases open the door to a wide variety of outcomes so\nTrump makes the executive order people sue boom it gets before the Supreme Court and guess what we have five not just for our three not too but five originalists on the Supreme Court who actually interpret language of the Supreme of the constitution as it relates to what what was meant\nIt was actually added to our constitution not this choose your own adventure nonsense so in in essence Trump can get this issue fixed by doing an executive order\nNow it's possible to Supreme Court says look Donald yes this policy is constitutional but it has come from the from the Congress well then he's got to pass a law may not be just an executive order\nBut at least you then deal with the issue of whether it's constitutional or not it does save at that point that the Congress has discretion\nAnd then the final option could be at the Supreme Court says no you gotta have a constitutional amendment I actually think we can get a constitutional amendment that no one has the guts though to pursue what Donald Trump has become the debate\nOh by the way why do I think he's raising this issue well besides the the simple fact that this is a legitimate public policy debate to have and it's frankly a legitimate public policy changed make\nIt's politics what Donald Trump has been doing for the past couple of weeks is joining up the Republican base um as he talks about the caravan coming through Central America\nAnd the way the United states making a big deal out of that as he sent five six seven thousand\nDepartment of defense troops to the border and of course today or he not only drops the end of birthright citizenship but he also says we're not going to let them into this country we're going to put um intense listen to this Donald Trump talking about tent cities at the border\n\nHold 'em until such time as a trial where we have the facilities are going to put up we're going to build ten cities will go to court tense up all over the place we're not going to build structures and spend all of this you know hundreds of millions of dollars we're going to have pets they're going to be very nice and they're going to wait\nAnd if they don't get asylum they get out and very few people they don't actually if you want to wait they don't\nUsually get asylum you know the eighty percent Brian is they released them and and then they have the trial three years later and nobody shows up but we're going to unlike Obama and unlike others\nWe're going to take the people were going to put them in and they're going to wait\nAnd you know what to things happen when they find out that that happens that far fewer people come up [noise]\nAnd also President Obama separating children from parents nobody talks about the long and said can have separated now President Obama separate out in the beginning\nSo Trump's talking about temps tent cities of course that's going to cause the ACLU to go nuts are going to say well let them out because we want them running around because we know that there as soon as they're out they never come back because Seventy five percent of them never show up for their immigration\nMaintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty

we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you want running your country then by all means staying home listen at the end of the day will deal with whatever it is\nWhere I'm going to rage their ... well you can rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad at Republicans that they don't go out and vote well I have very\nThat we can say he's already picked out the drapes she got this big Hubbard [noise]\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor\nAll bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call\nFor any poll ever I Know I've been with calls me I never get called for a poll and polls you know I look at them\nI Know a conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nOf but I also know that they got it wrong and two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that's why we play the game\nAnd you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight\nYeah because you can't tell you

that eleven rally blitz\nCalifornia Florida Iowa Ohio we all did you go\nDo when you know at the end for example we sucked up Obama for eight years it wasn't good for the country you know well we would suck up a Nancy Pelosi as speaker one more time but I'd rather not I'd rather keep the progress that we've made the last two years going keep the momentum going\nUm what we'll do that either way

if you got your Halloween costume on right now it may be too late but if you have a Halloween costume that you're going to go home and get into here are the six tests that the San Francisco chronicle\nHas I'm prescribed for you to have to go through before determining whether you're costume as appropriate [noise]\nAre you ready number one does the costume include makeup that would make you appear as part of a marginalize race that is not your oh\n\nWell the only marginal rise race that I Know of today are white males so okay then the answer is yes oh wait hold on but it is my own so I guess I'm OK their number two\nIs the costume depicting another culture in a way that a stereotypical or condescending oh you mean condescending like Joe Donnelly referring to can we go with the job Joe Donnelly quote again condescending like Democrat Senator Joe Donnelly talking about what a great guy years for race relations because of this\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both on the campaign side and on the Senate side or state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job but our director of all constituent services\nShe's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job then you could ever imagine [laughter]\nBut yeah for an African American apparently in your book\nSo uh Joe Donnelly would definitely failed matter what he tries to go as and he's been trying to go as a U.S senator for about six years\nI'm is the costume depicting another culture in a way that a stereotypical or condescending definitely condescending they're right number three does the costume involve [laughter] I'm ready for this does the costume involved sacred garments images or themes from a religion that is not your own\nWell no\nBut if it's Christianity you can do as much a to destroy it as possible apparently because ah I Know liberals out there who are constantly attacking\nPeople who are Christian so maybe the only religion that's exempt from this is Christian so you can still go as a Catholic priest a number of Fort does the costume demean any group of real people [laughter] yes definitely yes\nDemean\nMaybe poke fun at and you know what it's not necessarily that you demean everybody you demean or make fun of a few people\nI'm the interviewer has a no person on which is fine I'm there represent yes on prop six the gas tax reveal but the interviewer starts out literally on a narrative of\nProps six would eliminate much needed funding for road repairs that are dedicated for road repairs including the following projects in our community\nAnd literally for three minutes opening segment and then turn to me and said I'm Mr ... mile why do you want to eliminate road repairs like excuse me nothing improper six eliminates road repairs we\nLower the gas tax from the highest gas tax and the country back down to the fourth highest gas tax and the country and if you got to get a hundred percent of what's left the fourth highest gas tax and the country you can actually increase wrote funding by two point the rebellion\n\nAnd the interviewer says that's not true I'm like uh actually it is I'm citing the analysis from the nonpartisan legislative analysts office and so she had no response to it so the interview continued down this meandering little\nPath of both my opponent on the no side and the interviewer basically attacking and so um\nWe got to a point where she said this is a Republican effort funded by the congressional Republicans like no no no no no it's not that's not true she's like yes it is I'm reading from campaign disclosure showing Paul Ryan gave money I'm like\nYeah you did some money for the signature drive this campaign predominantly as it is funded by grassroots donors who gave an average of thirty seven dollars twenty nine thousand donors raising three million dollars\nA bats who's funding this campaign the little guy\nAnd yet you have yet to point out that we're up against fifty million dollars on the side\nAnd those no people are all people getting money from the government they are government unions and they've given millions of dollars each their average contribution is two hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nTo which she recorded again this is supposed to be a a unbiased journalist [noise] um well\nThe reason why they have so much support is that so many diverse organizations are opposed to your dangerous initiative including and then she started reading them off you know she's like including firefighters I make the union police officers on like the union\nSo finally I just said look\nYou obviously do not want to have a fair discussion here you obviously are on the no side yourself you don't understand the role of a journalist I think that's kind of embarrassing and it really let your viewers down or listeners down\nA and so I I find this conversation like talking to a dining room table and so there's no need for us to continue to waste our time with your show\nHung up oh she was not happy little snow flake was not happy\nAnd her comment was well this is how he engages in educating the public know I'm happy to show up on your dinky little show\nWe actually had a discussion about well do we want to even put this on the schedule they have no ratings I might you know why not why not late I'm Free I don't need to sleep less is to it\nIt's very frustrating [noise]\nAll right ... ... what I Want you to do is help us out in the campaign you realize that we are up against biased media fifty million dollars and special interest money and not to mention the fact that the ballot title has been changed on prop six they struck the words gas tax repeal and they put in a false title\nThat says repealed road repairs or initiative doesn't do that\nSo I Need your help I Need you to let everybody know the falling and it's like that baseball analogy I used earlier this week first play first base let people know there is an error on your ballot\nThere is an error on your ballot you say that because it gets their attention because there isn't there um about there's an error on the ballot I Need you to email and text everyone that\nSecond base the politicians intentionally put a misleading title on ... the politicians intentionally put a misleading title on ... third base\nProps six is actually the gas tax repeal initiative prop sex is actually the gas tax bill initiative and then slide on into home plate vote yes on prop six to repeal the gas tax so there's an", "show_name": "The
