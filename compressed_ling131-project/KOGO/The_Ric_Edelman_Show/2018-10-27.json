Greg you use Mr handyman as do a lot of our pros I don't think you get a better um endorsement than when our pros and our network use a company right yeah and you recently use Mr handy man on a A N referred I think it was it was Kyl's area\nKarl's area and they just did the work and it turned into multiple things this is talk of limited by worked out perfect because we're in the process of pulling a permit on this project but they have the need where they need storage space so I referred Kyle to them and they wanted an addict ladder installed\nAnd then I mean you can tell the rest of the trial but it turned into adding plywood and other other tasks that needed to be done while you were there right\nAbsolutely and so once we got the addict access and then we take a look at their space and it was huge so we laid in a plywood all through it and once that was done of a sudden it's huge and dark that turned into adding for lights a switch\nA little bit of handrail at the top to make it easier to get up and down a for taking their things up and then some painting and some electrical work outside or for the washer and dryer that are going to be moved\nAnd how economical of that and they have one company one person that you're going to be able to make all of those upgrades and having to call five different traits out you know to get that all done and it's\nVery hard to find those trades to do small jobs like that and that's why it works out so well for Mr handyman because that's your specialty you have the multi talented people to do that\nAnd it and I think a lot of it's a trust factor because you trust us to do the addict access and now you don't have to trust an electrician and trust plumber and trust that we're all that same guy\nRay or someone that's not licensed and then ... maybe not done to code or they don't have insurance I mean there's so many reasons\nYeah ... that's exactly the there there's so many reasons that Mr handy man is the right choice and being able to bundled those things together the economics of that\nI'm Bill ... if you were to call I Am a lecture that job a painter electrician or there's a couple of other things that you're talking about hundreds and hundreds of dollars more than you guys would be recharged correct\nHundreds of dollars more plus just the time trying to line up get a guy to come out and do the electrical then did come due the plumbing how many phone calls how many hours of your own time are you wasting by doing that and how valuable is that to you to make than\nThe choices then is to be able to make one call to us\nSchedule one appointment and get it all done in in a day maybe two days but then it's all done in and you can go on to living your life\nYeah I think that's the the savings to me is is one part but you bring that up like the the convenience factor exactly the whole is is even greater part what's our time more than the aggravation and having to play general contractor to a bunch of smaller jobs and the ... the other traits are going to want to more to come out to to you know ...\nRight again to you know different traits or don't didn't want to make it worth their while so they're gonna you know there are costs for that visit is going to be hire him you know why should you pay a higher costs for each individual visit you know just pay to have one one person to do it all\nAnd the ... the point I Want to make to before we get a move on to some other things we need to talk about is you don't have to wait to have a bunch of things to call Mr ... call them out for whatever your your primary need is\nBut then when when they are they're odds are you're going to think of other things that need to get done and that's a very efficient thing to do is when you're out there to to make that make use of that and I know that you Greg like you were saying you've used them so many of our other pros of use them I'm a ... a day when you give the phone number I'm for people to come and train them in\nSix one nine four zero seven nine eight eight eight\nAnd the three of you guys served the whole entire San Diego county\nRight yes yes oh San Diego ... is that you're getting the best the best team in service than we've ever come across them at a food from place to be highly recommend them thank you guys for coming in and sharing a little bit with us and you can find them at approved from ... dot com is you can find all of our pros I'm highly recommend using this training and thanks for coming in\nThanks and uh like the end it with the navy beat Notre Dame\n[laughter] and then I got my Dodger plug in their ... and I'm going to have an Irish kid all let me say that I'm\nGreg we got a a a just a few minutes left and and we're going to make an announcement at this point that uh is kind of a tough one in some ways than one in some ways but also a a a great which is kind of a turning of the page is not an ending it's the beginning of some new things but we've been on the air here at pogo for\nGosh almost Seventy or Seventy or in that range I'm Greg you've been on the air with with with us do end up since almost the beginning or you've helped found the network but we're changing things is actually the last show approved come pros that will be on the air here on pogo I'm trying to get choked up yeah me too\nBut I'm ... we're not going away the ... is not going away we are expanding actually is the part of a big a big expansion that we have a ... ABC ten is our TV home\nAnd you're going to see more of us in ABC ten where you're going to see us on the news are shows and you're also going to be seeing us on TV a variety of other places where you can see us our messages or you're probably going to get sick of seeing them\nIn their reach a lot more people that's for sure\nAnd we're going to of course maintain a presence here on pogo it's just not going to be the show you're going to help fill here about a year because it's our home we still love the station with our hearts it's but it's been it was where we started in our foundation\nUm but it's a part of our growth and a part of some of the evolution that we have but we still love the station and and we could never do what we do without it so we're going to maintain a presence on cocoa was but I'm the audience out that they've been listening to his loyal for so long it's our last show\nAnd thank you I mean I really enjoyed doing this and hopefully our audience will follow us on channel ten in other places but it's been a you know my every Saturday look forward to um educating and forming and being with\nAll these great prose so thank you everyone for listening and I think\nI'm [laughter] I'm getting emotional um thank you to the audience for being so loyal to us and helping us getting overly specific tripped up it's been a great run 'em but again it's part of our growth part of our our serving you more in a more robust way so look for us on on the ...\nThat's worth about a nine hundred million but none of taxes you can only by half the team so no outfielders for you forget about the Yankees are worth four billion dollars\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because the total GDP of the British version island says about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one tell nobody\nThat you won not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone\nEveryone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and\nA little bit more about that in a second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe like banks safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know secret police my house now\nIn a bank states positive box do not signed the ticket not yet\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy it but a copy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not willfully\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an L. O. C. limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice to you need a lawyer needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt Hey Mike Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million of taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start throwing out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced they end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always now you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful because they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely will you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to\nUh extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the Ritz fewer me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible because you need personal security and when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom\nYou just netted after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give them a million bucks you'd ... come on you're going to give her ten million\nYou just got a hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much you're giving your mom\nHow much is given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters\nHow much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece\nThat's a hundred million dollars\nGuess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give\nAway a hundred million dollars you know my friend not them you have to pay a gift tax\nGuess how much the gift tax is\nForty percent which means if you\nGive away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three\nFifty we haven't even talked about charity\nLet alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery requires a massive change their lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them in whatever you do for that ain't\nGoing to be enough in their opinion let me give me another reason\nWhy I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on free lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On the bet you'll have more than a million dollars is what you'll have won the lottery\nOf course past performance was known kitchen future results on the assertion that country's a federal ... support and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket because as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery\nBecause it's often the worst thing that can ever happened to mention all of this for one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one\nSubject aren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you win the lottery on\nTuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday and you did notice that\nThey're not only get get get rich you got a little poorer because of the stock markets performance and we're going to talk about the stock market and what it means for your investments than what you should do about your investments strategy as a result of the new volatility\nThat we're experiencing in the stock market and the bond market and the real estate market and the gold market and I'm going to tell you all about it when

sent to ask Rick and Rick Edelman dot com\nDirect this is George from California\nMy in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over ... percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk\nSo Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed investments that\nThey might not pay much an interesting about only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you tried to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of a good\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and they'll strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nBut the money to bill's call today but think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours is ... and you are merely the steward of that money\nHere the custodian your the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial moves\nAnd the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had a million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on bears and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm so that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and designed what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume\nWe are in our organization as a registered investment advisor the only conversation we aren't as that paid directly to us as a ... from our clients know commissions\nWere not to run and win sales contests are caught his reign on things like that we work for you you

a\nQuestion regarding financial literacy I have a twelve year old son and a ten year old girl who I talked to a lot regarding the importance of managing debt saving money and invest in for the future they both shown some interest but more so my son\nI got a book from the library which my son read the entire thing and when it's very excited when he read something about how to invest you know three thousand dollars from a summer job into a rough IRA in forty years later it's worth a you know a big number it was all excited and told me dad I'm going to be a millionaire\nSomeday I'd like\nTo continue um that thirst for knowledge but didn't find anything more at the local library for him to read\nHowever I Would also like him to learn more about life in general financial realities things such as various bank account savings checking credit unions how to balance a checkbook\nUm various kinds of insurance credit card in credit card debt and then just also investing for the future so I'm Wondering what books are digital media would be available for his you know that would be age appropriate for him\nYeah I don't like a a word book or software to go along with it so it can provide like hypothetical examples for him to work through their anything out there like that Kirk on\nGoing to give you the applied [noise] ah\nSo engaged and so focused on financial education for your kids\nYou know we lament in this country that there is a substantial amount of financial illiteracy\nAh parents seem to be talking to their kids about everything these days religion politics drugs sex but they're not talking about money so I'm really glad that you are and because we have so many\nAmericans growing up financially illiterate they're not taught me this and K. through twelve or they aren't getting any college classes on it in their employers are certainly not selling them much about money so I'm really glad you're getting your kids off on the right foot\nI'm going to give you two

first three parts of that book are really aimed perfectly for your children understanding what his money held his money work of understanding compound growth\nAnd the very basics of money [noise] uh
