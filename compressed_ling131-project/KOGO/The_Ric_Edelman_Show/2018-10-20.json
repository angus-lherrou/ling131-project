{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "About shade off into the various things that they are but you ... you brought up over the break we are talking about tying it back into what Tony was about ... about the energy efficiency and there's a huge element there\nYeah there's a lot of clients once again going back to feeding a specific need for a specific client you know a ... during the hot summer months uh obviously it comes down to eat and where control I also making your house more efficient\nYou know it's so with these clients that are looking for efficiency packages throughout their home to save save that green or the first thing of course everyone looks at a solar secondary thing as window and door packages you know button ing things up\nA and then your heating and cooling you know all these things must work together or good companies such as ... and a lot of the other ones that I work with they will look at these systems as an entire package to include solar window film treatments to the window film obviously is a giant reduction and heat a that's coming into the house we if we can stop it at the glass\nRight there even as a medium film something that's lighter than a pair of sunglasses even we can stop sixty five percent of heat coming through which is a lot less load a on the efficiency a impact your home making your solar an H ... run more efficiently\nAnd I know that that money in particular does take a look at at all the ways you can reduce energy use it a lot of companies don't do that and I want to add that and that's where\nYou guys um do you get such great advice and you are bringing up such an important point about that people don't think about a lot of times they're looking at the films for study purposes or the ... study purposes\nBut one value to saving the out a lot of times you're right they'll call for one thing uh whereas uh after we're finished with the console a decline of find that were actually gonna ... we're going to hit a five different values as a side benefit if they want\nA dead heat and Larry impact we can meet that if they want a strengthening of value their glass we can meet that you know so there's ... not to mention just the glare of dissent coming through chase me out of the dining room while you can mitigate some of that glare and then on top of that you're going to get the benefit of being more efficient through those exposures\nSo do you have to what you're saying lessening your own home when we can if you have all that stuff\nIf not unless you put window film [laughter]\nVirgil what I'm really excited about is the technology with roller shades and electronic shades I'm as ... have come some such a long ways whether they're\nA battery operated or hard wired and I know you were saying earlier I'm In ... about the how how many cycles these batteries will last now it's amazing discovered a cycle is where you guys are\nTalking about a cycle is a full uh you know shade retract and then dropped down so they end up and down to be one cycle so just like every industry there's been a big evolution and window treatments from a including window films window shades\nUh your blinds you have some really neat blinds now that ... you know the bottom up top down which gives you a lot more a variable in your view control and privacy well the shades a need evolution in this industry has been a pretty recent as if anyone's got any of the ... battery powered shades out there you know what kind of a nightmare that is replacing the batteries\nWell of course then the best thing is to have this stuff this low voltage you just\nJust plugged in the house you have to worry about it but if you already have existing home and are you finding it's a difficult a very difficult perhaps to get low voltage to those shades the next evolution to come out as these rechargeable shades\nA and these are fantastic you can basically charged that shade like you would charge your cell phone is just a little port on the side and you plug it into the nearest outlet overnight and you'll go fifty thousand cycles it's that's a couple of years before even need to recharge it shape\nThat's that's a huge with a low voltage that's something that you recommend somebody um would include if they're doing and remodel or the wire for that\nFor sure yeah it'd be if if it's a major remodel then then you provide power to the shades and a lot of times there's either built out balances to hide the roller shades or the shades have balances that come with them\nYeah there's a lot of options in in the world the window treatment industry has been booming\nUm consistently for the last Twenty years and we've seen leaps and bounds and that technology in the last several last few years and you can put them on a clock two which is really cool yeah uh you can have a much like you have a heating and cooling zones throughout your home\nYou can as you can divide every room even exposure up to separate areas on a on a automatic timer so it just does everything automatically wearing control it off your phone\nKnows what time of year it is and where the sun is rising all that kinda\nSo yeah it's there's some really neat stuff out that it's a pretty advanced\nSo severe you are such a a an interesting and great company to me in that you\nKnow and you supply the various options that somebody could fit need so you're looking at not what do we sell but you're looking at what could you need for your windows and what would you need to control or effect or or upgrade your your your lifestyle based on\nYou know we we don't believe in coming in and enforcing a product on clients throat that they may not need are qualified for so that's where the consul comes in is finding out what the clients need is regardless of what they called about\nA generally it's like taking a car mechanic you're bringing in what are you going to do you're going to make some odd noise about what we try to mimic what the car's doing mechanics got to figure out what it is\nWell I look at it sort of the same way as I come in\nAnd I want to figure out what you need is\nA versus if somebody says hey I Need window tent\nOr for this room why do you need window tent\nWhile I Want a privacy or heating litter control or or you know I went through last stronger or I just want I Want privacy at night well we'll find that if it's not our product or we don't offer that product she'll solution I'll find somebody who does that's what customer service is about is helping that clients need whether it's your product somebody else's\nBut you know usually we can find that named his clients will research us and find out what we do and then we'll narrowed down into a what the best thing is for the window shade a film or a combination of both\nAnd a lot of companies you know if you say you want to buy something and they have for sale they're going to sell it to you whether or not the right thing for you or not and right that's a that's not the right way to approach it I Know this is a little bit off topic but if something that I wanted to bring up because it's something that people think about um a ... is\nThe the ways that window films there's there's a variety of things that they do besides shade there's there the um security didn't as some of the some of those those things that the the the other things there that are part of windows ...\nKnow the funny thing about that Sean is I've been doing this for twenty two years now and every year I finding other industry that this product touches from a strengthening glasses what we'd mentioned which is security it makes it harder to break through that glass uh and then you have\nSections that or you know the reasons that from daycare to just you know prevention Social Security decorative heat and glare control efficiency lowering your carbon footprint prizes that eating privacy you know decorative and artificial turf a you know protecting artificial turf from burning\nGuess what the evidence and data which says that the U.S and the five hundred as average temperature than a year since Nineteen twenty six doesn't include fees\nBecause you can't buy an index you can buy an index fund\nBut the fund is going to have expenses which means you're not going to earn ten you're going to earn ten minus the costs so if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and at any given moment this month's performance the last quarter the year to date the past one or three years\nAnything can happen in that short a period Ohio was suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're going to hit in twenty Eighteen and they're not suggesting that the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year to date they're saying that over the long term they're expecting targeting\nAn assumption a seven point two percent and oh by the way\nThat's before fees because you know Ohio doesn't pay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the costs that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point now let me take another step further\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming\nAre going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generating successful returns is by picking the white investments in other words there are Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick well\nLet's look at it this way according to temper on in twenty twelve\nThis is six years ago\nThere were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the S. and P. five hundred that year only five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exist only five hundred and Ninety of them be the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a fewer number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty two of the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf stock mutual funds on the ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nThe the us and the five hundred every year for five years in a row\nOut of thousands cell ask you again do you think you can pick the funds that are going to outperform the market\nI don't think so I don't think we can do it and are from we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive\nInvestment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the returns of the market minus fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes and inflation so that your money is earning a competitive rate of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about eating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand atheists and pay five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo if you picked and above average fond of funds that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe\nYou lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any kind of [laughter] hey you know I mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets not the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term financial\nGoals and objectives are met and to that and I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans\nForty percent\nAre facing poverty\nIn retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are going to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return if not\nBuying a lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick\nJoining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot and avoid and what's not that's not the key\nAchieving your long term financial goals our goal here for you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving and the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell that's why your call us AAA plan wreck we've been doing this for more than Thirty

I have a radio\nAd I check out our entire radio resentment inside all\nGo\nSecond I told you have a couple of clients were unhappy with me we also got a couple of radio listeners who are unhappy with me here's a voice mail I got this weekend\nGood morning my name is John I'm I'm looking at on the show right now I'm looking to late\n... those people that don't have enough air on finances to retire and this must be a six year old quote ... I'm sixty four I'm lost money during in the market my husband go passed away\nA had hatched by and I'll make a choice to say that I had nothing other than like Social Security and I and again you score jak\nAt companies should work into that because the guy in there to provide money for their retirement\nIs another thing I can recall hearing number one number two the other thing that should be scared and white lie\nOn if I can find it the quality of their lives and many times working Kenny very exhausting I'm ... that are stepping day\nAnd um and Seventy five I mean I think that it's an incredibly um ... comment she has made on the show this morning and I'm horrified that he is a great with everything she has to say why don't we get to where\nNinety or actually guy maybe that's the thing to do\nThat with that it's now worried with our finances\nSo I'm Sorry that she sold said but it's not my fault that her husband lost all of his money and the two thousand a credit crisis by investing in hedge funds and it's not my fault that she's not finding herself and retirement with nothing but Social Security\nAnd so when we say that given that situation you really don't have much of a choice but to continue working\nI I guess all I can say is well maybe the truth hurts um and maybe this is why we need to plan better and we need to more effectively get professional financial advice before throwing all of our life savings in the hedge funds just in time for the biggest market melt down in our entire lives I feel badly for her but\nI have a feeling that I'm just the messenger reflecting on the severity of her personal situation um but here's another voicemail but I got and this boys you might recall hearing before with listen\nI'm calling to say that I look at him and tell us quite a while\nAnd I decided I Would never invest\nAnd him company he goes on at knocks him about a simple answer that take three minutes he takes aim at ten ... himself\nLike he had the outcome is he no longer a good example like clear sway thinking it's boring now that it takes up most of the show with questions actually stop answering please help\nI think too old to keep going on with your show it becomes very boring let's talk about the financial crisis this week [laughter] that is going on and on\nAbout ... questions\nCome out self picture show I don't feel that I'm a psychologist so like my friends have listened to feel the same way he checked wander all over the place like a lawn chair\nSo the fascinating thing that voice might be familiar to you because nearly seven years ago in January of twenty twelve she contacted me for the first time and here's what she said back then\nAnd maniac on\nAnd on land way second maniac and you can ask if man and they came to an individual\nIn there and it had life depended on it\nI Am actually wait I aged out of him and it's crazy ranting game hands him and shame on hand by God man\nBut no it was fascinating here is look\nI I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening to the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure why psychologists would be recommending psychiatric help or she should be recommending psychological help but anyway\nUh it just it just shows to go you not everybody's a fan\nOf the ... show so I don't know maybe I should have you know some regrets of hell I'm handling the show why but I'll tell you who does have a regret\nSuzie Orman has a regret\nShe says that she has a major money related regret that back in Nineteen Ninety seven she bought five thousand dollars worth of Amazon's stock and sold but just a few years later is she still owns the shares it would be worth more than six million dollars [noise]\nSuzie says quote it makes me sick to even tabulate it unquote she says she purchased the Amazon shares because she liked the branding she said quote\nI thought it was such a cool name for a stock I could identify with the idea of me being a woman that wanted to be an Amazon\nTurn them into other investments and they strip out the interest in principle from the securities because some of the investors want the interest and other investors want the principal a different time periods so they\nTake these treasuries and they strip out the interest giving them to one investor and another investor gets the principal backup maturity and then circled strips and so Wall Street invents lots of products like this they invented lions liquid yield option notes\nUh they've got tigers treasury interest grain tore receipts there are page after the income generators\nBut no nobody on Wall street has ever created a bear because you know that's Wall Street doesn't like bears um we like balls but I don't think anybody ever invented a security called a bull um\nBut anyway I digress so\nLet me ask you the question before I described for you whether you should be investing in a strip or investing in a tip a treasury inflation protected security oh tell me what it is you're trying to accomplish\nA I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is that I have quite a few CDs right now which are destroying regular interest and what I wanted to do is take out and not money or I don't go over the limit that up to my Medicare\nPayments every year mhm with increases\nAnd I know it could go to somewhere around a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in income and I like to do that only by drawing down on my Ira between me and the wife and I don't want to have any additional ... All right that I had that you know be\nPaying to stay in other words what I read the areas that they take you don't have to report that to the state\nArt hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and will you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYes it is so have you done an analysis to determine that\nI had a really done it out but I think I probably have enough money stashed away that it probably going to be you know whether or not you know depending on how long that naturally and how long the lifeblood\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation uh let me just to real quick back they're not gonna for what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of ...\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nOh probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all end all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand aren't\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shape\nWhich means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment risk\nAnd therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investment strategy I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bond\nA relative to a Banksy day I don't know if the difference is all that worthwhile relative to the complexity the securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary bank CDs the difference in the yields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\nAlright I was wondering if it would have any effect\nI don't think it's going to be material enough that this is based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper\nOr I could certainly argue that all of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs it necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got an amount of income you need not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you\nUh so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues we have an office in Cherry Hill not far from you and mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you\nBut that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing financially speaking I think you and your wife would be fine\nOkay okay over there in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nIt is then if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number will connect you with our colleagues in ...\nBut fidelity has been working on this for the past five years they've been doing it quietly without any fanfare or publicity they have one hundred employees working on this and according to Abby Johnson the c._e._o. of ... she said this past week quote\nOur goal is to make digitally native assets such as bitcoin more accessible\nTo investors unquote so why are people like David Swenson and huge organizations like fidelity announcing involvement in the block chain and crypto world and why should you care it's because this fundamental technology\nHas the potential according to the bank of England to completely transform the financial services industry\nWe operate right now from an economic perspective\nWe operate on a trust basis when you engage in a transaction when you buy any goods or services from anybody else you're trusting that they're going to honor their end of the bargain when you buy a house you know it takes three months right from the time you sign the contract of the time you close\nIt takes three months you have to do a search to verify the deed right you go to a title company and you've got to make sure that the seller really does on the house that the dean of the house is legitimate\nAnd that title search exists because well you don't trust the cellar and so you spent months and you spend thousands of dollars in a title search and you buy\nMortgage insurance you you buy insurance on the deed in case something goes wrong it adds time it adds money it doesn't do any real good doesn't increase the value of the house for example\nWell the block chain isn't authentication process it replaces the trust process with authentication under the block chain using this technologically on the Internet\nThe only way the seller can sell you the house is if they do in fact owns the deed and once they do the transaction on the Internet\nThere's no need for title insurance so the transaction can occur much faster and much lower cost and into lemonade the middleman and there's no way the transaction can be changed altered duplicated or delete it and this authentication process radically\nAnd rapidly makes improvements in the financial services sector let me give you one illustration\nIf you want to why our money overseas you've got to spend about eight percent in wire transfer fees and it takes five days for the money to show up and the other country\nBut if you do this with bitcoin you can do it in about ten minutes and it's virtually free\nSo a company like Western Union\nIs now under threat because they're no longer needed so when you were lemonade the trust and replace it with authentication you wouldn't lemonade the middleman you no longer need that trust company you don't need that title service company\nAnd as a result someone's out of work so the middle man\nCould be disrupted as a result of the block chain and the technological improvements the ability to do transactions faster and cheaper with greater ... safety and confidence is why\nDavid Swenson has made his announcement of putting money from the Yale and download fund into bitcoin and the block chain Anwar Sadat witty has just announced that they're engaging in this as well\nThey're not the only ones pie Wu si is announced a new partnership that is designed to build confidence and trust in crypto and usher in the next one hundred million users\nOf crypto assets such as bitcoin as Therrien late coin ripple and hundreds of other\nCrypto assets that are available Peter you see is going to recommend standards for transparency governance security risk management to help shape industry practices in Switzerland their federal regulator has now issued a license to a crypto currency investment fund\nThe primary stock exchange in Switzerland is developing a block chain powered trading platform\nThat will allow traditional financial assets to transect business and creating liquidity for institutional investors [noise]\nThere's a new thing called the universal protocol alliance it's a coalition of leading watching operations that is creating a fully transparent digital asset that is collateralized to US dollars they're calling it a stable coin one of the big concerns people have had about the coin\nAnd other crypto assets is that the volatility as massive well if you have a stable coined something that is tied to the U.S dollar it's designed to solve that problem is it any wonder that there's now an escrow company in California that now I'll let you buy a home\nUsing bitcoin and the block chain which is the technology that allows bitcoin to operate is now being used in voting in West Virginia they allowed\nMilitary members who are West Virginia residents who are serving overseas to use the block chain to vote they get it\nThere the first state to have allowed it and they did it in the primaries this past may and they say they're now going to allow it to be used in the November elections for some of the residents in West Virginia by using the block chain there can be no voter fraud\nAnd that's the whole point is that it allows a hack proof means of logging transactions in this case votes and West Virginia is proving to be a pilot for the entire country it's quite possible as I predicted in my book the truth about your future\nThat the twenty twenty presidential election will be done on the block chain meaning you won't have to go to a voting booth to cast your vote you'll do it using your smartphone\nPretty exciting stuff on the other hand there are still worries about what's going on the FCC\nAnd the CFCC that's the commodity futures trading commission and they shoot alerts warning investors to watch out for frauds because there are some crooks claiming that they have FCC or CFCC approval for their block chain and they point investments and they are fraudulent\nYou need to make sure that you are being very very careful because it's still the wild west in fact the international monitors\nPretty fun has warned of new vulnerabilities in the international financial system because of the rapid growth of the coin another crypto assets so is this a time for you to invest in this stuff like David Swenson has I don't think so I don't think it's ready for main street yet\nBut the day may come and the need for you to become aware and informed and educated is right now and that's our job for you here on this program is to make sure you're aware of the innovations that are coming to you can evaluate whether they make sense for you or whether you need to be involved\nIf you've got questions about block chain and bitcoin and crypto assets call us a triple a plan wreck if someone is pitching you an idea an
