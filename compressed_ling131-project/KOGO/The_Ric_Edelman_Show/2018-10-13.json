{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "I liked it a traditional measures of hip hop version of at the ready in the fall off of it [laughter]\nUs and it was alright alright\nThank you so much crystal um you're listening to a ... a great one of the pros that we recommend on a regular basis is Thompson building material talk a little bit about\nWell so I always love referring Thompson actually I have a new project we just signed this week it's over in U. T. C. and we're doing a whole front make over with stack stone new stucco do windows and I'm sent him there to get samples they're all excited they came back with their\nDifferent stack stone samples I'm really looking forward to doing this job and I'm working with Thompson\nThere at sixty six Eighteen federal boulevard right off the Ninety four freeway five miles outside of downtown absolutely and um they have everything from indoor outdoor living to\n'em or hard surfaces stucco colors you name it you've got to check out their show room is probably one of the biggest show runs in San Diego county is great\nIt's great for for for inspiration we ... we call it like a living breathing how's it going to go in there and getting inspiration for what kind of material when he was here in Europe\nRight exactly so um check them out you can go to Thompson B O D G dot com and look up to San Diego location or call them at six one nine to eight seven nine four one zero\nThank you Greg and you know what you can do with Thompson too is after all seasons windows and patios ... does your backyard you over there and they got pots and all these things to finish it off with you know that some of the patio furniture and different things they even have these crazy dog houses and the reason I bring up dog houses\nIn the doghouse on a regular basis yes I live and I I'm used to it um uh\nUh but uh besides that and I also track mud in when it rains\nWe're talking about last night if you have pets and it was raining and was raining and you let your dogs out to go to the bathroom they ... probably track mud in the house unless you have one thing ... what is that one thing\nThat would be artificial turf right that solves humid problem\nThat you know we have to have in our backyard and that wasn't something that they told us about beforehand as one of the benefits they you know water savings and maintenance they told\nThe ... and I was worried about being a problem with the pets with the urine and that stuff is which never is 'cause it just brings down every so often but I never have to worry about ... feet wiping my dogs feed off again it's All right right yeah ... ... people that come back to surprise without our mentioned at\nThe time they they don't even look at that aspect of it and there's so many different types of turf that you can find the right mix for you and your pet yup yup there's many different ways to solve that\nYeah I I Love that that so that's we're talking about from the ground up today so that's one of the places to start is with the turf and you when you're designing your ... are you starting from the ground up kind of designing the what you're going to be doing with somebody's backyard space\nSure when we when we come in your backyard the first thing we look as well to ... what are we going to build on\nAnd what is your idea too for your back yard 'cause a lot of people don't know they just say I want some shade but you've got to think about well what kind of furniture you're going to put under the shade what which will tell us how and where to put our posts and how far are we need to project from the house\nWhich direction your house faces are you facing east facing south west because if you're facing west you're going to allow some in the afternoon\nThat's where the motorized screens may come into play underneath the patio covers um are you going to be a big entertainer you just want to small space we can covered all we can give you options we don't just try to sell you something we're going to walk you through the the whole process to show you all the solutions we can provide for you and you pick the one that's\nBest for you so you're ... your average customers somebody that is has a back yard that they're either not enjoying completely or they have they have a neighbor this upgraded there and they can see what's possible now or they didn't even know what's possible right and then they what was the what are the things you hear from people once they've gotten these these upgrades\nWell they should have done it sooner because so many of the patio covers are made of wood and you you know they termite out they dry rotted out you have to cost the paint him they fall down a deal looming um patio covers or the way to go they look like would if it gets dirty or just hosted off to them to the maintenance maintenance free and you're done yep\nSo let's see we're continuing with the with the ground up team so you you do the foundation you as do some people um have just slab and then you can work with that\nBut what what what do you what if somebody already housing existing space as something down on the ... yeah if if they got their concrete they're already we can build on top of that or they may want to upgrade and get a coating a or papers or a stamp concrete on top of it is the company does ugly you can do something absolutely yet\nTo do it doing remodeling we tear out these old covers all the time and I think people have this vision of patio covers the old school just you know penalize systems that just looked kind of fifties yeah from the fifties in\nThe new covers that you do and the even have ones that have uh like vents on him right over ...\n... they look so nice they look like wood and they have a great factory finish on him and they hold up I don't I don't know why anybody would build something oughta would when you can put one of these in that or maintenance free and they're going to pretty much last forever\nThat's right you're done with having to ever do that kind of maintenance he don't have to paint anymore you don't have to maintain it you'd have to worry about termites or is just a a great great solution for your back yard\nSo if you put you put the foundation elements in the ground the ground elements you you then look at the shape structure that you're going to be putting in and then what elements you put without what rooftops and you're going to pick what you know shades sides have you ever do any windows can be a part of it as well I\nGot windows well you know a lot of people think a patio cover of just sitting under for enjoying your having eating out there on the patio [noise]\nLot of patio covers you want 'em to protect that side of the house to keep the son out of your big picture window holdouts on reflects off your large screen TV you can see it at certain times of the day so petty cover can provide solutions not just for sitting under for shade\nThat's that's a great great point that I hadn't even thought of\nA so I Know you provide all of these things that the Latino doors systems um screens but for those systems a is a one stop shop and let's talk about this just a little bit 'cause we don't have a little bit of time but\nHaving one company like you go in from beginning to end to manage the whole job now I'll be honest and and tell me if I'm wrong I bet if somebody shop around and and then just drove themselves nuts they could find\nMaybe one or two of the things you do slightly cheaper from some company that maybe even a shocking a truck to where they might save on a little bit right maybe\nBut in the long run having to organize all these different trains generally costs more time money and aggravation and yes\nThat's right and and so by having one company that ties it all together we can we know we're getting ready to build and why we should do things in a certain order or why we can't put papers down first before we dig voters and most people\nDon't have the expertise the resources to pull it off themselves they need a company like you that can do the design and has all of the trades in place to execute the project I'm successfully\nThat's right and again we when our sales people come out we don't hard sell you we just provide solutions and answer all your questions and concerns and maybe even give you some ideas that he didn't think about\nYeah yeah that's the best one of the things that it was if the non hard sell them to an all the option to provide so I recommend if you're unhappy with your with your backyard if you didn't get the most of it now's the time to deal with it you don't want to wait until until June July you want to deal with it now and ... in a little secret\nThis is not your busiest time of year right we're getting ready to go into a little bit slower season yet so you may get into the Q A little bit quicker and you might even save a little bit of money so this is a great time to call all the windows and patios um and the number to call is six\nOne nine three five zero three seven to three or visit our show rumor opens six days a week\nAnd the short run location for three six four Twain avenue off mission gorge road thank you so much um we're about ready to wrap up here I'm getting a signal from Heather she's gonna cut my throat if we don't clothing so ah but don't forget the reborn cabinets\nSince Nineteen twenty six according to but it's an associate the average annual return of the some ... five hundred end the Dow Jones industrial average is about ten percent per year\nThat's assuming that you had a portfolio that consisted of nothing but that now who on earth is going to put a hundred percent of their life savings in the stock market\nI wouldn't I don't think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile outside class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering massive losses in a very rapid pace and that's why you only have part of your money in the stock market\nUp until Wednesday people have been saying\nAm I I'm a minority that I'm not doing as well as the stock market how calm I don't have all my money and the stock market because the more diversified my portfolio is no worse\nBeen doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else of course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really don't have all of my money in the stock market boy am I really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given asset classes performing well and even might be performing better than alternatives doesn't mean that you ditched the alternative instead we have to recognize that every dog has its day\nAt any given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell Thirteen hundred points this is why you don't place all your money into stocks\nAnd it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us was something else that's really fascinating\nYou all know what's been going on with General Electric\nRight we've been talking about gee for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty percent over the past year GE he was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year wow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the S. and P. five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date through Tuesday\nRanked at the four hundred and Ninety six best stock yeah out of the five hundred that came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than gee\nYou're the date but as of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\n\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things\nThat have been happening in that company but suddenly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else gee did fabulous and became the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next because you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't the just the G anyone from among the worst two of the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the death filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the S. and P. five hundred or advanced micro devices a bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year\nBut now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best\nSoup for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just the suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed when there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not enough itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other new or should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still hunting along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing\nStopped watching them lose it doesn't mean you should change your investments that means you should change the channel that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today I Want you to stay with us because if you're still struggling on what you should be doing with your investments I had the number one piece of advice\nAnd I'm going to tell you what

traffic update us at ten forty six [noise]\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the radio show heading out to Troy, Michigan Paul's on the line how you doing for\nMy question is about the option of take a a lump sum of passion\nBriefly I've been given the opportunity to take on an wanted your input on it\nSo ah the question is whether you take the lump sum a or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter]\nSo that's a yeah it's like they're not reduce no do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks the good news is this it is straight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis\nVersus if we take the lump sum pay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all it requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great Australian our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nLeap pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases the sheer they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where were the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions it's a fixed amount\nWhatever they're giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul no single\nOkay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nUh so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce it you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given they lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know your salary you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd he would say the best thing to do is put in a fiery\nYes assuming you're eligible and in most cases you are you roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdrawals from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy you create on your own\nAs I said usually the answer is yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this one detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see which strategy\nOr are they elected to continue to experience declined with something that the increased rates continue to go up a wondering what your thoughts are on the uh on this topic\nCarrie thanks for your question uh yes you can reasonably expect that further increases in interest rates will create further declines in the value of bombs now a couple of caviar to this\nNumber one yes the markets do anticipate\nActions by the government in other words if it is clear if the government has sent messages which they sometimes do that they are going to do things the market's doing to dissipate that and they adjust\nSecurities prices based on that in other words this is called a leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing securities\nBased on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market as a leading indicator not all lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively thinks is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully baked in\nOn that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond will have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nSo that makes sense longer the duration the longer the maturity date\nThe greater the swing and value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases then you should probably not own long term bonds\nUnless you plan to hold them to maturity if you'll never mature you don't have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking it might sell your bond prior to maturity\nMeaning you'll be subject to whatever market prices are being offered at that time then you would probably want to own shorter term bonds rather than longer term bombs in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year maturity is rather than twenty and thirty year majorities or for that reason\nSo yes you do need to be aware of this and this was something new and different for investors most folks are comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to\nInterest rate risk for the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates have pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment and not realizing that race could go up not just down\nAnd they haven't been used to the fact that bombs could lose value because for the past ... bombs are pretty much done nothing but go up in value because when rates go down bond prices go up or down a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question 'cause a lot of folks at the very same question\nDon't buy a bond unless you're planning to hold her to maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably own bonds in that funds that are shorter in maturity rather than longer and to know exactly what kind of bonds are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them\nYou should talk with a financial advisor and we're happy to help you triple each plan Rick to attack us\nWe're hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied to all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase in price is for a number of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase in price is for a number of the products that we can purchase\nMy question is where does all that tariffs money go as it goes straight to the government coffers\nDoes is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah Mick uh the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S and it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service instead\nSo yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers I'm\nReally that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and are there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government in taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it is receiving this helps to solve that problem but uh the burden is paid by American consumers\nWho a foot the bill so yeah that's what terrorists are terrified his synonym for tax\nRevenue generation protocol right I mean they come up with all kinds of you ever noticed that you know longer right your taxes at the end of the year to the IRS they want you to write your check to the United states treasury because nobody wants to write a check to the IRS but everybody has happened to be patriotic and write a check to the United states treasury [noise]\nWe don't have a welfare department anymore either we have a department of health and Human Services we don't have a war department either we now have a Defense Department it's how you phrase it isn't it I think George Orwell was a guy who called us out on that first\nHey if you're struggling with your challenge in retirement of Hattie or

over twenty five is Rick at all the\nDetails\nHis tail geo and cam why I live\nIn New Hampshire I'm Phil for our rain is almost out of here at least\nA much lower cost than traditional whole life insurance and the the people who bought these policies back in the eighties and nineties will remember interest rates were back\nInterest rates were much higher and the insurance companies were assuming that they were going to continue to earn those high interest rates and that's why they were able to charge very low cost for the policies well guess what those high interest rates have come down the policy costs have gone up\nAnd the people who bought those policies back in the eighties and nineties while they're now in retirement there now in their seventies and eighties and nineties and they are getting notices that the cost of their insurance is rising\nTo the point where people can't afford the policies anymore so just about the time they are getting nearer to their date of death\nThey have to cancel the policies because they can't afford them anymore and all the money they've spent for all of these decades is no poof it's gone so if you own a universal life insurance policy different from whole life different from term life if you own a universal\nLife insurance policy and you are struggling to figure out what to do with it can you afford to keep it ... you have available to you\nGive us a call we may very well be able to help you with that so called us a triple a plan wreck if you have a universal life insurance contract and you're struggling about what to do with us\nHere there's other news in the world of fraud air he just came out with a a an amazing survey result\nYou know you have an online account right you have more than one you've got a bunch of 'em so just pick your most frequent online account put that in your head for a minute\nRight you know what a count you have on line that you use more than anything else\nAnd you have a password don't you on that account\nDo you use that same password on more than one account according to ... research half of all Americans do half of us have the same password across multiple online accounts that's dangerous because of a crook gets a hold of one\nThey can therefore use it to open lots of others of your accounts [noise] half of Americans have found fraudulent charges on their credit or debit card\nBut only fourteen percent of order to credit freeze on their credit report so if you haven't frozen your credit report you can now do it for free as of last month the federal government says it's now free for you to freeze your credit report\nSo you need to take a look at this also keep in mind that\nUsing a debit card\nDoes not protect you from fraud\nThe same way as a credit card does you know if you let's say you use a credit card and you get ripped off someone steals your card or someone makes a fraudulent purchases or you use your card yourself with a vendor doesn't deliver the goods right and you just you know you you just\nCharged hundreds even thousands of dollars and you got nothing to show for it under federal law\nYou're only liable for the first fifty bucks as long as you notify the vendor and the credit card company right away like I think it's within forty eight hours\nYou're liability is only fifty dollars but that's not true if you use a debit card if you use a debit card you owned the total liability for fraudulent charge so you need to be aware of this fact somebody give me three simple steps number one\nPut a freeze on your credit report number to\nSet up online access for all of your financial accounts why because if you don't set up online access for your accounts a crook might do it in your place so you need to do it first and three\nAnd now it's a

help\nUs further this conversation I'm very excited to bring on the program Alicia Munnell she's the Peter up truck or professor of management sciences at Boston College is terrible school of management and more to my heart she's the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research that might not sound like a big deal you but in our circles in the financial planning world\nThe Boston College Center for Retirement Research produces some of the most important data a useful in the financial planning world so leash I'm really excited to have you with us on the program today\nOh I'm delighted to be here and I like your endorsement\nAlicia is a a former member of the president's council of economic advisor she was former assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy um so how is the retirement outlook these days for today's workers\nIt it's not good Rick I'm we calculated in ... shows about fifty percent of today's working households are not going to be able to maintain their standard of living once I stop working\nWell that's not very exciting and ... is the situation been this way for a long time or has the landscape changed in recent decades\nUm the landscape has changed a lot in recent decades has gotten a particularly a or since the financial crisis\nMean to some to those me\nWhy what we should ask why we lost a lot of money in two thousand eight and a lot of house values and those items haven't totally return\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dallas pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it and yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nSo that that's a sharp of the stock market the people who hold stocks or the people in the high income but it's so if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have 'em in their stock values have gained and\nTheir stocks have gained a value on but for the bottom two thirds of households they really don't hold very much and stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our our most recent data for two thousand sixteen and hadn't quite gotten back to the\nPeak of the bubble up by two thousand sixteen but the house values are really high on the coasts as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even high in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day in our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks than owed seven had they held through today there'd be a lot better off\nThe first fact as you point out as most people didn't own stocks at all second those many of those who did hold stocks and those seven panicked and nine sold at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time there are ... are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later\nThey haven't enjoyed the run up in value because they didn't hold on to their investment for having continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat's right and it's and it's a lot of people lost their jobs the train a two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded that they withdraw their money as well on marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments [noise]\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and has a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves that they won't outlive as one key working longer the longer you work\nThe more money you're adding to your investments to more but those investments can grow in value and let's face it the longer you work the shorter your retirement will be and that means the less money also when we need to accumulate so it was a double benefit or by working longer\nIf you take your Social Security benefits Seventy instead of sixty two it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional\nPresent so work longer so that you know our saving more your investments can grow more value your ultimately going to get a higher monthly Social Security benefits and all that money isn't going to have to last as long as it otherwise might have exactly\nRight but lose the only one other asset that's left that a lot of people I think ignore and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for\nWhich I just I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer\nUm you're right for many people their houses their largest asset outside of the", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "13"}
