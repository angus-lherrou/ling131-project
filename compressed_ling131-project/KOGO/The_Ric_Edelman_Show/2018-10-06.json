six one nine six six three three six six for\nThe best in the business over there and maybe a window films I'm somehow or by mail and Brian I'm of course solar is the ... the kind of go to energy savings ... you know a ... the money you also have a electrical roofing which have a lot of elements to it out of somebody starts the process of [noise]\nWell they can give us a call at six one nine three to zero seven three seven three or they can visit our show real mountain power away the target shopping center on Palmer on a road um come in there and see feel touch all the panels in the uh items that we have there\nAnd I know that both of you are or care about the community so people have just have much to talk about things that they've asked they've heard about today if they can call you and your answer some questions about the your fields and and kind of filament on some of those things do\nOh absolutely and you know solar is is the way to wipe out your electric bill these other things that we've talked about will help you be a lot more comfortable because most people keep their home it's Seventy eight eighty degrees because they're afraid of that summer electric bill so by doing these energy measures they can be very comfortable and completely wipe out their electric\nI get to keep it like a meat locker like I keep my home but I really want so joining us in the studio a we are thrilled we are we're graced by the presence of\nMissed by their friends or just because I'm jumping around studio here and I heard you're a\nMan in demand and radio show you know I think there's a limo gonna pick you ever get to go to the airport the stars tonight or something like that\nAnd I offered and more money so he might be more loyal\nTo us yeah yeah you caught me in the hallway who's written a or [laughter]\nMonopoly money I assume\nIt's all your um your here ... we love talking about national nursery and all the kinds of different things that that grow and but uh we we have a ... or you have a lower if that's yeah amazing piece of technology that is something I've fallen in love with tell everybody what that is the the part of our\nYeah so ... came out with the autumn lower it's a robotic lower easiest way to describe this to people because people have seen this before it's it's a ... for your lawn um it's a mower that goes a in your lawn it ... midnight when every time you want to set it for\nAnd it keeps the lawn always cut to that nice level height\nUm this is something that we want to ... daily so that way the law and always has consistently the same\nUm but it doesn't pick up things like the rumor does so it puts those clippings right back into your lawn which actually is good for the long because it keeps moisture in the soil at fertilize the soil and so therefore not only is it keeping your lawn mowed but it's keeping your lawn healthy\nUh a lot more benefits to it or that because it's continuously mon you don't get weeds because\nThey don't allow the weeds to flower in the lawn and so therefore you're not getting the weed problems that you might have in the summer months with lawns as well and then the nice thing about it is that you don't have to go into your lawn anymore I mean you just get to have your weekends you get to save your time\nAnd you get to just enjoy your lawn and not think about a chore does that count as a honey do\nI think so I think that this is a great way to get one is just ... hey honey I got to get this because this is the way I'm going to keep the project was down here\nWe are talking about energy saving say and and the energy this this was have is the energy of mowing the lawn varieties have this you know it's basically a robot that does it for you I Am so thankful that we live in the age of the Jetsons words he's an adult and you can have a robotic more ...\nAnd I was shocked at how how cost effective it is I mean it's that expensive\nNo I I the small unit that will do an average size lawn I I if I remember correctly is around sixteen hundred dollars in ... yeah ... just for the equipment and the installation kit\nIt could be something that you install yourself within a weekend no big deal you need an outlet to be able to plug the docking station into where it goes back and charges itself every time that it needs to be recharged\nAnd it's it's easy to use you it's really user friendly where you just program it you said it to run and then it just keeps on mood for you and it's\nSo efficient I mean with the rechargeable battery you don't have to go get gas and fill up the tank and worry about you know spark plugs in all those things right well that's\nOne thing but even the people that go well I got a battery operated more yeah but then when the battery goes out halfway mowing their lawn then you've got to go throw it on the charger and then an hour later you got to finish mowing their lawn because the battery was drained at that point in time this takes care of all of those things for\nYou and this is all on always basically look great 'cause it's doing it randomly all throughout the throughout throughout the week or at the ...\nDays that they well yeah exactly and that's the goal is that you should never you should never see your lawn where you look at it and be like it needs to be mowed it should just be set where you're doing it for you whether it runs all day every day\nMine I have a small on so I only have it ... run Monday Wednesday Fridays from the hours of midnight to five AM and it's not loud you don't have goes right by my bedroom window and I never hear it running\nIt's one of those things that I don't believe it actually is working because I go to bed at night and it's there and when I wake up in the morning it's back there but yet if I ever I've never mowed my long long flipping out that actually\nAllowed to have a nominal I mean and we talked about this the first time and there's actually limit so I think people may have trouble grasping this whole concept of the mother just stays within the the lines that you establish road ads like putting down one of those invisible\nDog fences where you put a wire and that tells you where to stay and where to go um and then once you put that down and just stays in the area so it stays out of your flower beds and the other thing I Want to really mentioned is that it's super safe yeah a lot of people think about this being oh well it's it on your running around going to chop things up\nThat's not the case at all you you would you would have to really try hard to hurt yourself on it and then even then it would give you a paper cut 'em and doesn't have a large blades spinning you are only quarter inch razor blades that are in there and it stops as soon as that sense as any kind of you know movement or Lyft or anything like that so\nIt would not hurt anything safety is a big thing with this\nOne of the other question I have is because it can basically sit out in your wall and somewhere else you have a ... you know it kind of a little dog shed\nSome people do build those yeah\nUm but I was worried about uh getting stolen on the second you lift it up off the property it has alarm goes off and it's totally shut down as useless right\nYeah so I mean these are installed in public places Newport Beach has them on a lot of parks have them where basically not only does it have an alarm so and it picks it up and goes off but also with GPS trackers so if it was stolen you know where it that it would be cool if it just a ... like a ...\n[laughter] [laughter] so\nThis is available at mission Hill's nursery yeah we have a demo unit so if you want to see it and I also want to say if you are ... are sitting at home if you want and

T. S. are relatively new they've only been around a couple of decades compared to mutual funds has been around since the Nineteen twenties and each he asks are simply a cheaper version\nOf an antiquated retail mutual fund they generally you know you don't have to pay commissions to buy them there are very low expenses there's also generally very little turnover which means the annual tax liability is very low\nAnd each year we believe simply offer a better alternative in many cases for many investors and as evidence of this I mean I you know I've been promoting in ... I don't know what Fifteen Years\nAnd we are in fact finding that back in ... wait there was about a half a trillion\nInvested in each yes that was you know ten years ago today it's not half a trillion it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF\nAnd that is exciting it shows that hey you're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment costs are and you're staying up to date with the investment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as you grow up with what you were familiar with\nBut you've accepted the need to adapt\nAnd stay current with the market place so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it\nIf we take a look at data that has just come out from a a recent survey\nBack ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great that each shift have skyrocketed and in value from five hundred billion to three point four trillion you know part of that as market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions in the ATF as well\nBut not everybody's been\nTaking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of ATF themselves they're not taking advantage of investing at all\nTen years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research that twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in cash\n... oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year 'cause that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing only ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were\nIn two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were and\nAlmost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand mate and only forty one percent say they feel\nFully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history with the stock market tripling and values since the steps of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say that they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem\nAnd just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials said they believe that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that's simply true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\nYou can open an account with the dollar not a thousand not ten thousand now I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that\nBefore you joined your retirement plan at work before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore to build investments\nAnd oh by the way\nA lot of parents are are not saving a lot either it's not just the millennials but the millennials parents that are in saving a lot and you know one big reason for that\nI'm going to tell you when we come back\nHere on the Rick idleman show I'm going to tell you what it is that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars on\nEvery single year and no it's not their kids who are on the playground K. through twelve ... it's not raising children that as the parents are spending a lot of money on\nIt something else and I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back on the program so you can figure it out before we return\nAnd we're going to tackle that in a whole lot of other fascinating information including the latest investment opportunities you probably always wished you could get a pizza\nBut never had the opportunity to\nBe amazed at some

Eighteen to thirty four year old children\nThey're spending on their adult kids twice as much as what they are contributing to their retirement accounts two thirds of parents say they have to sacrifice their own financial security for the sake of their children who are in their twenties and thirties\nSeventy three percent say that they factor their finances into the decision of becoming a parent in the Nineteen eighties only thirty three percent of people in their twenties and thirties did that the average cost of raising a child today is now about a quarter of a million dollars\nNine out of ten parents say they're surprised at how much money they spent\nBy becoming a parent\nAnd nearly two thirds say they encounter financial difficulties associated with parenting\nEven children who are living independently are receiving financial support from their parents parents are contributing to school costs health insurance rent car expenses parents or even paying for food and for cell

were talking in the last segment about the Donna Xing amount of money that parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties\nAnd how it's impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this then it's going back up a line\nSixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire\nSo in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even those sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement\nSixty nine percent of teenagers\nSay they know little or nothing about financial planning well actually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security well that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you\nFirst of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem\nTeenagers in fact as we pointed out earlier on the program today they know very little about\nPersonal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you this was just a one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [laughter]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs they don't understand how expensive car czar or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad\nYou haven't told them of fame so my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenager sit along side you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook let them participate\nIn games with them when the time you go talking about investments include them in the conversation\nYour kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drug epidemics and\nOh oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet the last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that last taboo in American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined a sock religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send me your questions in an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ...\nAt ... dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kind of weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago there was a castor has to say\nHi Ray cares Custer against from Brazil\nYou seemed a little bit surprised with affects that to your show was listening to all sides of the U.S but I think you were in the insurance because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about for one case Roth IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do find or opinion when it comes to principals\nLike financial responsibility a diversification editor location\nDollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here as a shows that budgeting is not a very good use of so much time but we'll take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight years old all the run this two years old the youngest one would go to a profit school next year just like the oldest\nSo far as being able to save a little more literal above twenty percent of my income but was it affects ... if I don't make adjustments or want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about tough as much of what I'm saving\nA and how much you have to withdraw and which account you must make withdrawals from if you don't follow the rules very carefully you could not only in her taxes but you also encourage penalties of as much as fifty percent\nOf what you were supposed to have withdrawn but didn't so you've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distribution the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw and it's required hence the name are empty required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice\nYou can take the money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said you were doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging in reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life\nIf you wanted to do it on a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's\nFine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you'll get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the account of the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ths with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name another IRA and her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts\nBut we separately care if any of those accounts were for one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount\nFailing to take it from the proper accounts\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw\nThis is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money once every month the iris doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the town on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary cause you to pay taxes unnecessarily so the calculations are complicated\nThe rules are cumbersome and the penalties for ever are usually not only severe but they are on yielding meaning if you try to complain to the tax court\nYou're most likely going to lose that case so we strongly encourage you to work with a financial advisor and attacks advisor\nNot only to make sure the calculations are correct but so that if there is a mistake you're advisor will alone that liability instead of you because you can hold your advisor responsible for negligence or errors or omissions\nAnd a reputable advisor will certainly stand behind their advice to say oh we told you to do it we were wrong we will make you whole not for the taxes you have to pay those but for any interest or penalties that you may incur\nAre buying out the pensions they're turning them into a new contracts according to ... in the second quarter of the sheer over eight billion dollars of pensions were converted into annuity contracts\nThis raises the question will the insurance company be able to honor the obligations that the company itself was not able to do I'm going to give you the advice that I've been giving you for years if you work for an employer\nThat promises you a pension you need to assume that the pension doesn't exist\nDon't assume that hey I got a pension and therefore don't have to say for my future wrong\nDon't assume your employer\nWill honor its obligations don't assume you'll get as much money as they are promising don't assume you'll get money for as long as they're promising you need to save for retirement as though the pension doesn't exist fabulous great if you do end up getting the pension good for you nobody ever yelled at me because they ended up saving too much money you know what I'm saying so\nBe careful it's really the simple answer whether you worked for a state or local government whether you worked for a union dare I even say you work for the federal government you need to assume\nThat these entities will struggle to meet their financial obligations obligations they cook\nDecades ago under a very different economic environment in this nation a very different workplace environment than we have today\nAre and if you have questions about your pension if you have questions about when to start your pension if you're being offered a buyout by your employer should you take it\nIf you're wondering should you start your pension benefits and when you do should you take a single life only should you do a joint or life with your spouse should you do a term certain benefit how should you take your pension it's a one time only decision once you make the decision you can't ever change it it's a big deal in other words\nCall us let us help you you've never face this before but hey we have lots of times let us help you like we've helped a lot of folks just like you call us a triple late plan wreck don't go the pension decision alone policy triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two\nLet me change subjects here I'm I'm broadcasting as I mentioned to you from San Francisco I'm excited to be

and then Wells Fargo gathered their bank accounts in order to get the payment when people couldn't pay the auto loans Wells Fargo in some cases\nCharge overdraft fees damage their credit and even in some cases repossessed their vehicles\nAccording to the ... being the OCC this could involve six hundred thousand drivers last year Wells Fargo said it would take sixty four million dollars to pay everybody back but lawyers representing the drivers say that's way too low a number\nMeanwhile the Justice Department is probing whether employees committed fraud and Wells Fargo spanking you that they want to know the Justice Department if management prompted employees to improperly alter add information that people's accounts\nThe Justice Department wonders if there's a pattern of unethical and potentially fraudulent employee behavior tied\nTo management pressure\nWell along the way Wells Fargo has suspended two executives of federal probe in the purchase of low income housing tax credit is behind it a senior VP and another V. paid the Justice Department is investigating whether the bankers colluded with developers to submit low ball bids on tax credits\nWells Fargo by the way is the largest purchaser nine billion over the last five years of this tax credits and it's not just those two are VPs that have been suspended wells has fired or suspended a dozen other employees at Wells
