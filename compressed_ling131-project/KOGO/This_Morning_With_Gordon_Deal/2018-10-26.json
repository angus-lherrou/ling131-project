Seventy eight more days he's Miami isn't already underwater so\nWhat was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye PCC report\nAbout what we can

that stuffed with\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nUnfortunately you put your finger on it\nMy guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem I ... or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and how and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected\nAll right to level rise forced to migrate as their cities become uninhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get in the such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to the law of migrants coming from low choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut it has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head and the thin mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nTo global climate change in

you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida\nOver the Next Fifty years and now that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster if Florida had water flooding\nLet's
