{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "Put together some very interesting factual side note and a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances\nIn Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and\nThen went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles\nNow in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought you know this seems kind of hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map\nI said holy crap you know within the middle that try and go to Sam in national park yes\nGo that's quite a coincidence so Yosemite kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances in kings canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that crashed in disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist at ...\nStrange air currents that things which seems reasonable but when you bring into account that there was also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... you want to get into or should we just go you jumped into the cases of air disappearances in general\nAnd it was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the book from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\n[noise] so that's a I grew up not far from Marshfield in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field gone right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps\nThat patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise] [noise]\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting a ... out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair was man by the Senate earners Cody twenty seven years old and an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they ah start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands in Cody with control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by ... here and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for a person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to over ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a feeling of five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above him\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they had uh LA ship with two pilots and

the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each\nA airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks the radio was in perfect condition no distress call for fun and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy boat in a postcard ship that saw the blimp dip and dropped to wears on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowd and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there's a couple of theories that developed a and

to that extent it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scan the Internet facing systems to these where they um\nThe server it's like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line the jets will do the remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability better knowing that we know about that on all the ...\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and\nI'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis to see when the um the customer has a patch to them so they did that to a few states before um the ... and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it getting at only the Internet they think system could not getting

never default and repackage them into securities to make them seem risk list\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from ... is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use the it\nWe got to Christ basically because who uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk letter was bankers who thought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in price\nThey essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we're individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether to the regulations or attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises\nBut it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much wary or of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nHousing is a very good example I used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several reasons for that one is that well I'm an Asian country so maybe fewer people need homes\nBut also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages to show that limited who can buy a house I and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand in the crisis and they've kind of learn to sort of like be more cautious ...\nSo we see an investment if you look at housing ambulances methods combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have it so many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to turn to a home equity loan to start your new business are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise]\nSure you have your ... just hear any real I'm up there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley what people want is to not start the next Google or Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new business is being forms actually historically\nQuite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially a people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nWrong for speaking with Greg it cheap economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or they're not related\nThink it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat is to say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to ... and fell into that so in some sense cut some of them as a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that some of the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects are less likely to get a bus in a recession\nNow that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market as well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off [laughter]\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances by about which that risk start to grow and if you look at the regulatory side too yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from
