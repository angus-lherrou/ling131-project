involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happen and helping we manage we're joined now by doctor Judith or law\nPsychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly empathic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and so loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAccident and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted or anxious or depressed\nAnd so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and center yourself and realize that you're not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons in the brain where I'm going out and pass to that's why it's such a an interest in and out of the ... and an impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle urine mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\nMm So how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know is going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I'd suggest all night and pass patients has to take notice fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on for a lot\nOf stress and negative news it's just too much for anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature meditate exercise ... friend and laugh so that's one tool but also just notice if past traumas\nUm trigger it for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident\nNow you're paying about losing your father's triggers so you have to know that different now that could make a big difference to know that you know I'm dealing with this in addition to the current situation [noise] um and also\nDo a lot to nurture you know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now be able to meditate go outside um\nLearn you know is a complete sentence with paper because then pass don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever the types of energy vampires are that criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll of this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in the news you don't want to be around energy vampires will I write about her destroying your energy\nRight we're speaking with Dr Judah oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that
