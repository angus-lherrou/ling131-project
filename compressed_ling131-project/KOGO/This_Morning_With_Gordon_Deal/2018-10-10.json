from\nYou know noted that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wind but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that the strategy is also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president has expressed dislike for programs on on\nThose two channels [laughter] there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that the people who are influential with the president may see some
