Thomas Manu\nJimmy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the subplot tomorrow and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring a piece a plot to do and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties a remote viewing\nHim to an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the\nMinister of antiquities is trying to partially restored monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter I'm a new alien um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nA few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked as far as the way we think look then you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth\nI think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're up next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the uh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public uh\nUh to the pyramids and for research and just general public access and I heard that after the uh um spring or Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public and I'll take my answer on the air\nGreek question Daniel my new what's it like there are now a dialogue\nRegarding jumped to have a lot so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a hermit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert truck and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so I'm the one hand it's also like investigators\nOf being invited to come on and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do well\nDo you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is it ... yeah how was she was still the director there\n... I think he is actually involve a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved a he's not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he is involved they are of course at by a if you put\n'em you know I think they're sort of a mixed bag you know there's the public's eye of a tool you know I was on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientist archaeologist who loved what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of sort it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects\nThat uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being shaped him political right now we're not I understand that might do it and I respect that you know there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from ... stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's what are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listener's question I think I forgot than it was down you I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you used to call the eleven so I think that has something has changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even each opposes that talked to some of some of the scholars you know the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA Fayette they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this was coast to coast am more by new when we come back stay with us\n[noise]\n\nHe\nLoved to ease\nBest from wherever you are on your schedule play assay one line except most transfer credits\nFor information school two three five five lines sat then learned for yourself by the wall Street Journal ranks asked you fit in the nation from producing the best qualified graduates and white eighty seven percent of ask you grab recruited within Ninety Days a graduation learn to grow and learn to succeed and learned at the right at Arizona State university\nTo learn more about ... online degrees ... school his three five ...\nUse peyote video cam why I go my\n\nPresident Trump versus sixty minutes I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\nI never knew how dishonest the media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a soundbite\nYou'd think that frankly I'd say so you just seem to be saying that she lied about a ... you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter what we want\nReuters says the interview in which Mr Trump proved eager as ever for verbal jousting on a series of issues showed he had no intention of abandoning his freewheeling in your face persona as president ...\nCruise with heavy equipment are scooping up to breathe in the Florida Panhandle town to Mexico beach the coastal community of about\nA thousand people took a direct hit from hurricane Michael last Wednesday is the big storm came ashore with one hundred fifty five mile per hour winds several homes in Cape stand laws were pushed off their foundations by the strong storm surge\nAs of yesterday more than one hundred Ninety thousand homes and businesses in Florida were without power along with about a hundred twenty thousand in Georgia federal emergency management agency chief Brock Long is calling the damage left by hurricane Michael some of the worst he's ever seen\nA lot as a lot of people in Florida lost ... um [noise] you know we can't replace lives but we can rebuild\nJoseph zone robot is overseeing the search and recovery missions in Mexico beach she said two hundred thirty people rode out the storm dozens are still unaccounted for Michael is blamed for Nineteen deaths by the way\nPresident Trump plans to visit Florida and Georgia today to see the damage it's eleven minutes now after the hour on this morning Americas burst news [noise]\n\nCapital one is building a better bank one this feels and acts nothing like a typical bank\nIt's why they're reimagining banking and building something completely different\nThey offer accounts with no fees are minimums they also offer one of the best savings rates in America and you can open a capital one account from anywhere in five minutes capital one this is banking re imagined open an account today inexperienced banking re imagined for yourself\nCapital one what's in your wallet capital one in a\n...
