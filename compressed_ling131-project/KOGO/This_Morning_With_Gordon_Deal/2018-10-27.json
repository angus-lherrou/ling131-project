worked all these years this is supposed to be what it was four and we're blessed now to live a lot longer and certainly healthier for a longer period of time where you can enjoy this so it's starting law it is the starting line folks and you're going to inherently have some money yes of course you're going to use right away and then yes we will build you like I mentioned maybe a\nA bucket where it's a ... year buffer of investments their cash or cash equivalence and you're spending that money\nBut what it's doing is there's no volatility on the money that you need soon and yet if you keep money that you know you won't need for the first ten years or more retirement in some sort of diversified portfolio sure that money will have some short term volatility to it but if you know you don't need it for at least ten years\nThan the volatility wouldn't technically matter unless you just couldn't stand seeing it in which case we would also teach you ways to lower the ... even on your long term money exactly brat so [noise]\nYou know hopefully not too much of a tangent or rant there Dave and not kind of I kind of get going a little bit but it's hard not\nTo Brad you know you got we've got thousands of listeners right now who could very well be absent of this planning that are having a little bit of a tough time\nAnd I would say we we all we we've been mentioned in a lot this last year more so in Dave you mentioned earlier on but the market up trend for the last you know almost ten years or whatever it is now since you know bottoming out too and in late two thousand eight early two thousand nine it's caused a lot of people do enjoy these games and there hasn't been a lot of these scary moments\nIt doesn't go forever some of these ... that kind of happened in twenty Eighteen in January and February in a couple of times we even throughout the year\nI think it could be a healthy thing I think right now these jolt or if there's some people if you're getting nervous I think that's a healthy good thing it's called a wakeup call it's a wake up call and it's a wakeup call that's happening before anything bad has really happened right\nSo if you're starting to realize man you just just a small corrections that have happened already make me real nervous than you definitely need to come in and see us and we need to put together a plan right so that way bigger corrections that inevitably will happen don't completely rock your world right\nAnd folks at that's us reaching out to you\nThrough this microphone through the radio and an opening that door as wide as possible leave your checkbook at home say at all the time\nThey do checkbook at home and we're going to build this for you at no risk no obligation to you and you get to see the depth and the quality of the work that we do here and you get to take it home and then make a decision is Epstein and white going to be the right fit\nTo be sitting at your side and making sure you have\nThe boldness and the best retirement possible well I'm going to give you that opportunity you know give me give you a number right now to call and that's eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight once again eight eight eight five six four seven eight Seventy\nTalking today with gave Epstein and Brad white they are fiduciary advisers that scene in wide retirement income solutions guys we have a little bit of time left in today's show focused a lot on volatility and sit on the other risks that are out\nThere but Brad is there anything we haven't covered yet on the today show that you can make sure we discussed before we wrap up\nHey Bradley I got this you know folks but we you know ... another way to minimize volatility is making sure we maximize all the sources of income that we know that will be coming to us and one of the big major uh sources of income that most of you will have out there is Social Security\nAnd Social Security is really complicated they've set it up to be complicated\nIn most view if not\nProperly educated we'll get it wrong\nAnd literally leave tens of thousands maybe over a hundred thousand of lifetime benefits that you paid into over your working career that you left on the table earn benefits that you did not get back money you paid into that you did not get back that would really be sad\nI don't want that to be you and so when we're building Bradley a retirement income plan to help people minimize volatility okay minimize risk gets returns that we need in order to have\nThe most bold retirement possible maximizing\nJust getting by but maximizing all that you've done one of the key ingredients to that is making sure you get Social Security right\nAnd if you're married and how to how to best maximize that between the two the two spouses and there are so many strategies gang that can be overlooked\nIn the timing of when Detroit with them and so gosh you know I could go on and on about how many people we've had\nBeen doing Social Security that's down for nearly three years thousands of people have come through our conference center and and learn so much not only about Social Security but how it integrates with everything else that makes you you rally when that's done correctly\nThat in of itself Jen you know will reduce volatility because if we're getting you know the the most we can\nFrom those sources that we know work\nThat are coming in Social Security if you're so fortunate to have a pension if you have some rental properties along the way\nIf you've made some investments or a lot of your money is in investments in retirement accounts or ... retirement accounts how do we minimized taxes so for minimizing taxes that means we're having to pull less from our accounts and if we pull less that means more money is in the accounts\nAnd folks when more money earns more money and so all of these things integrate chat and allow us to have\nBetter chances for keeping pace with input inflation minimum ... or ... absolutely eliminating the the risk of running out of money\nBefore we run out of time which is the number one worry Gen of all retirees you know that's you know that we don't want that to be you so what is it that gives us an elevator that uh the opportunity\nTo have the boldest retirement possible where we maximize every aspect of what makes us up financially is having first the blueprint to retirement does\nDo can you build a house my friends without a blueprint no you can't\nCan you absolutely willy nilly go into retirement without a plan well you can but good luck with that you really run the risk there I mean you make it ... far riskier\nWhen you don't have a plan and how you're going to pull from news accounts for the first time\nHey if that's not a shot between the eyes when your paycheck stop for the first time in your lives your choosing where to pull this money from and if you're doing it willy nilly uh you're most likely than doing it not tax officially\nYou're most likely taking way more risk than you need to and pulling from the wrong accounts could be selling low instead of selling high that can be done quite easily I can really get on a soapbox here Bradley\nI don't want anything about your retirement to be willy nilly\nYou know I don't think you want to have either folks you you you want nothing mystical\nOr up to chance of when your paycheck stop what your future looks like which could be twenty Thirty years of retirement which is historic\nAnd that's why it's so important for all of us today what happened in generations preceding us we're a different group were far more at much greater risk today because we're living so much longer God willing\nThat's a great risk but you know to make this money last twenty thirty or more years\nYou better have a plan you better have a plan for that money\nBecause if you go about it willy nilly you could be that person in your early eighties healthy and out of money and that would be a disaster so I always like in a Bradley think about you walked into a theater\nAnd the courting opens and it's a movie about your retirement it's a movie about your retirement and\nWho do you want being the star do you want the IRS to be the star of your movie do you want a medic Cal facility to be the star of your movie no I don't think so do you want the stock market\nAnd the way the volatility has to be the star of your movie Epstein and white want you to be the star of your movie and how do I best help you be the star is give you a plan\nPeriod end of discussion leave your checkbook at home we will build it for you this is the no embarrassment zone we've seen it all and so\nWe're going to open the curtains wide for you to come on and and be the star of your own movie give us the opportunity to help you the phone number is eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight once again eight eight eight five six four Seventy eight Seventy\nEight even listening

nothing wrong with dreaming as one expert says as we shift our thoughts away from what's wrong in our lives to the possibilities of something better we attract good things for ourselves\nVisionary coach Laurie Dixon is here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins or you what do you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real and starting to believe and possibility\nAnd show what it does it allows us to start to dream and dream in a big way we know the the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch relief far\nSo that's part of the process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political fun we start to look at our lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way\nAnd so people me things that give them hope\nAnd when we dream and when we wonder and we think it I go by that ticket what would I Do think that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance in a great way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however\nI Do you know during a walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nSure and so you think about turnout not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers are yours and you have to go back to work that day what you want to do is say okay well I Can't I have\nX Y Z and instill that blank can why can't I Dream about a bigger house is that something that's gonna blessed my family is that something that I'm going to have
