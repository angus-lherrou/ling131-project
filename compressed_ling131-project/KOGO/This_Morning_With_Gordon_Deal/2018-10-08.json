{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "You're toward Halloween and that's why a gallon\nWhich is called Halloween by being the evening before the Halloween day of all saints day and then all souls day is all mixed in to this battle of a religion and philosophies between the ancient European pagan and the movement of the ancient Christians\nWe've got Kyle and Clinton, Utah now it's his turn hostile\nI how you doing okay go ahead\n[noise] All right so I I just got off work at eleven thirty ... and I was in the ... and the Katie Hoff or log in\nAnd I'm cleaning it I'm up in it's called the day room you know where the ... people come they do their activities and all of a sudden I say this will nine year old boy I Would say\nMaybe ten eloquent and I cooked steamed directly straight you know the ... I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and so I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working\nThere for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves and he wasn't\nSupposed to be there or was he\nI I don't think so I talked to the CNA and a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people that they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me the October\n'cause it's not a full moon cause of full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHow do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I I asked them and they ... from what we understand no owned died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf Illinois in ... where do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again and are part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder drier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around similar to when you're drag your\nSocks on the carpet and touched the door knob and there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source a creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call it an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has some visible filled around that that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that it again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nInsurance don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland and\nUh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast\nAt a place called Roanoke Island and they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mysteries the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating foul and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com has no period after

come into Monday\nSon to go behind the numbers of the latest jobs report from the government the unemployment rate fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at ... dot com ... what's that number mean\nIt means that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nWe believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon ... unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a and a sense adjusted\nAbout projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment in our country and we've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strange from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers uh but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the uh hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent to ... percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with mark Henrik senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nAh well for one that's of average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a four informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nAnd nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is\nI said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWhen it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so\nI'm to the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world\nAh and perhaps none of that changes frankly\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked by people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\n[laughter] I think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh the you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend a and other words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years [laughter]\nOr does it mean that we're overheating at at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impacts of the tax cut begin to fade and twenty twenty\nI think probably twenty twenty as a date to watch and that happens to coincide ironically or perhaps not what the next presidential election\nNice mark ... senior industry analyst at ... dot com\nFor some program is

Mr O'Rourke as the Democratic party's antidote to President Trump but Mr O'Rourke remains dogged questions that he can turn out the legions of young and Hispanic voters any Democrat will win or rather will need to win an election in Texas He has refused to employ a pollster for Barrett negative TV ads\nThe latest Wall Street journal NBC News poll rated young people and Hispanics as the Democrats least interested in voting in next month's midterm elections here's Wall Street journal national political reporter Reid Epstein read what's going on\nA year and a half or so now but our work or ... previously a sort of low profile congressman Raul Paso who's running for the Senate in Texas had Cruz a and he is something of a phenomenon there he is drawing crowds for a political events a larger than anybody has ever seen in a state\nIn Austin be at a concert with Willie Nelson the true fifty thousand people a which is probably the biggest political rallies since President Obama's too though may campaign\nBut the question for Mr O'Rourke and protect us Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that are as we know from twenty sixteen and past election tend not to show up\nIn numbers proportionate to their share of the population there had been trouble elections were in turn out a goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so ah the ... campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they will have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama did and that may or similarly to like what President Trump did with white working class voters or non college educated white voters and twice sixteen but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence hurting our data to show that that's going to be the case\nAnd it was interesting a data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nThey tend to be a little more Republican than a dispatch around the country and get twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of Hispanics for the Republican compared to twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts impacts are are fairly gerrymandered too many Democrats as possible and then and they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the down the ballot for for local races or you know and so that the general elections have been a cakewalk short one party or the other and\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add on to that there really hasn't been a competitive statewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh and so there's not a\nPolitical machinery to get folks out to vote or the ... campaign has had to build that on the fly over the course last year and a half a and whether there'll be able to do it\nUh in time for November six of the big question\nFor speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is written a piece titled Beto O'Rourke draws big crowds in Texas but he's voters to not to vote the reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're where's that come from\nWell just no I mean if you ask a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's come and ask for a and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having it all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the ... the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh some of the counties that\n... that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C\nAnd campaigning and uh in February when I was down there he was then counties a inch having more people show up to his see him then voted in the twenties sixteen election in those counties are and so he thinks that he's able to draw a\nPeople out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reading for them to court because who has been so Republican uh one of the things that he says on the campaign trail that he doesn't believe that Texas with a red state but it's a non voting staked or you can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive\nNow the corollary to that is by\nHis house district in El Paso or haven't voted much either so there's not [noise] while he is certainly been very compelling on the um the campaign trail has drawn enormous numbers of people ah the evidence that he can get to the show up at the polls\nAre obese is not grounded in in his own electro history a\nAt his house district is one of the twenty ... twenty lowest turnout districts in the country in twenty sixteen uh in in ... fourteen only about Seventy thousand people voted in the general election in his house district out of
