{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "You know a few times um you know in in stories and an end in film that I don't know if you've ever seen a movie called ... um that was the idea of that movie with the whole movie was told to kind of backwards started with the ending and you went gradually backwards at the beginning [laughter] um but no that that's that I couldn't tell from that from that description of may have written that\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes out the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually wants to be on I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year I'm Out I'm In this came after we but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma and we're taking away I appreciated\nGeorgia and Nick Sterling man he was ... he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about the the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it has to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber\nComing home from Italy crashes in the desert that they can't do that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and Bob companies just happened to be walking by and seen his newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we live the experience even though he didn't fly that mission you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd haven't psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him to add a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and ... when the show ended close to the ending of it\nThe nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes and so some at another he really transport himself back in time and be twenty five ... crashed you know struggle with those shows that ... day and\nHe had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy a you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to capture events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed you know at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that\nSo I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany that already thought he could alter that event\nOf course but a man I don't know we it they'd be odd to say which be my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store I end the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine [laughter]\nBut when he got a break from the department store you went and got drunk came back he was sitting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was two grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything\nHe went outside and he was all down down he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know and pecans man he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and it got it rained a department store\nThey found car well given these gifts out at this place like a John ... mission type place you know when it comes and goes where did you get all these gifts if you get a receipt for all these is Bob Bob goes not just\nFound the bag and shrimp and I'm just giving them out looking at the PlayStation and the department store owner came in there it is there is a merchandise well here they are by you know and the guy's name was Mr department store All right and\nAnd it would be to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but it can it right and so they had to go to court store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen ascribe it it can figure out why those gift recover from it they were coming out that bag\nSo just before they released the oil Santa Claus he raised the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it\nTo Mr dandy huh you know and we got our toasted on the wine and they walk outside and they think Santa Claus flying overhead and play with reindeer a society and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans that remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can that was actually re made in the twilight zone feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the reference to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again by plane kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of time your neck but uh I I've got to tell you this is a topic that is so dear to my heart of it brings back memories when I was a kid watching television my folks were there in the living room with us those are great time short they\nScrape memories yeah yeah it was a different time and you know for all of us and uh yeah it's great to ... TV can bring you back that way and you know so it's yeah it's great to think about\nLife was different too sure it sure was yeah yeah absolutely as a kid that didn't have a cure in the world did we\nKnow and that's what a you know that that's something Iraq showing was was yearning for in a lot of those toilets and that's just to be able to go back to being a kid and having to being carefree and being in a sense and and the less stress and everything else and that came out and and so many stories\nBy the way you believe it was wrong about one thing you're not a bad bad man\n[laughter] I could take it from from bill moment he can call me that that's right\nThat's a classic deck one more time about your website if you went for people\nSure will be a rod Serling memorial foundation or can be found just that Rob showing dot com WWW that rod Serling dot com\nAnd uh I have a Facebook page that's dedicated to the book so it's not my personal pages it's for the book it's Facebook dot com forward slash rod Serling dimensions all when we're rod Serling dimensions ah the working title for the book was dimensions of imagination so it was that but\nThe book is called Rob showing his life working imagination\nShow per neck thanks again up next we're talking about haunted collectibles and collectibles to next\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available bribe bone and know Android ...\nListen ... on demand anywhere anytime coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today\nHe's tail geo and cam why I say go live\nA candidate here as young an attractive heat the heat looks like Kennedy and tucked back Obama\nI'm hearing a boatload of money and people really thought that that race might be in play\n'em in retrospect at John out that didn't really come that close to punish him four point\nUm but it was not the rate that Democrats thought that they might have been that district\nUm and there was just as galloping enthusiasm for this candidate um that it's starting term any a lot of better or I'm very similar candidates I'm very similar dynamics and those races and so I'm a Democrat they're running toward work ... absolutely\nUnbridled in there and the other ... about this guy I wanted to get that break so stay with all this may be very recently and it might have the same kind of at the\nCenters they do those um I don't know these comparisons wind up being distracting for these candidates like a you know maybe the the simple Boehner is more likely to say oh yeah I heard he looks like so and so or sounds like so and so I have no idea what he stands for the like the I just thought I'm just wondering what does that hurt\nYou know I ...

First\nThe recession people had fewer kids during the great recession so this just fewer kids graduating high school so the ... the supply of 'em are the demand for universities um is going down there is just simply too many spots show as a result the schools are competing for the students that are out there\nAnd giving them some you know financial inducement to come to school [noise] um I'll add however this is the most elite schools or do not play by the same rules everybody else I'm pricing power for Harvard and Yale and in schools and brand names is is is not diminishing [laughter]\nBut but for schools that are a little bit less a prestigious that were demand is noted that's where we were beginning to see this increase in in ... in scholarship offers which is sprayed though the real costs of college\nWill give us some of the the average numbers\nSo what we're seeing is that for private right now the real costs the sticker price of a private school [noise] um average across the country into a twenty Eighteen Nineteen is forty thousand five hundred and ten dollars but people are paying the real price twenty seven thousand two hundred and Ninety\nDollars and that has been flat for a few years last year twenty seven one sixty I'm right and if you go back to wait on line and it was twenty four thousand so there's been a big ramp up but that they're able to stop [noise] um and in public it's about fourteen thousand for the real pressure college\nUp from about eleven thousand in a way to nine but it is actually\nDropped thirty dollars a between last year this year so the numbers are you know this is this is not a huge savings and there was a significant ramp which is built into those costs over a decade ago but at least it's not\nContinue to go up and the way it was\nSpeaking with Wall Street journal reporter Doug Belkin about his story about the real cost of college flattening or in some cases even ticking down a little bit as schools give more aid um you said to the diminishing pricing power is causing tremendous stress among many lower quality schools as their enrollment decline what's happening there\nSo for schools that are dependent on\nTuition which means they don't have significant in down which\nUm and then they don't have a a a a really strong brand\nUm they're having a hard time competing against other schools to attract students which means that their class sizes are getting smaller which means at their revenue is shrinking which means that they're beginning to cut clashes and professors which is that they're less competitive and that generates a fewer classes so they sort of a death spiral for a lot of schools [noise]\nAh that that's going on around the country so the is the sense of the schools more schools are going to close and merge is is very very much in play right now\nAnd I started Wall Street journal reporter Doug Belkin thirty minutes after the hour\nOn this morning Americas first news [noise]\n\nFor\nFox
