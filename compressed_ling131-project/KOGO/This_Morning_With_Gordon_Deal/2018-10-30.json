{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "It's exciting though it's like I kinda like it\nWell safe from my perspective it's an exciting time to be alive it really is All right I'm I'm enjoying this I think the best days are ahead not behind us I think the United states is going to see an economy that it doesn't understand and that that's going to be a just launched\nBy generation y that this monster generation that's fourteen to thirty three years old that it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners in furniture and automobiles like\nThe old days yeah incidentally uh in in talking to the you know I talked to all sectors and talking to my automotive sectors are cars that drive themselves are not going to happen\nGood good they're already killed some old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough truck driver you know what that what we\nKnew how would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers sitting\nOut or you're not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has little tiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a ... and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to a a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me the people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying\nYou know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway\nIn there you know the truck has park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store I\nMean how how is he how's the driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that that a\nA R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide Ninety million where are they they're in the military\nAnd the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another major more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need their oil\nWe've got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nAm one who's always missiles though guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I say I what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north and\nThe south the you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist group that obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple\nYou cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West because like Florida is now the third most populous state ranking New York state and also a senior so it's become the largest city out raking I still don't hear\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\n... that that is

election are barely a blip\nIn political advertising this year President Trump and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi meanwhile are featured in tens of thousands of ads Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie biker which has been looking at the data Julie what have you found\nThat bottom line is that both President Trump and minority leader Nancy Pelosi are turning up in quite a bit of mid term advertising\nAnd take to President Trump we found that he it's only topped by two other issues in mid term advertising and that's health care taxes on he wakes up number three in a common interest in terms of advertising\nRight and then in terms of those themes he is portrayed sometimes positively and sometimes negatively\nTrade 'em there's actually there's\nA surprising amount to a positive Trump ads out there when the family even I'm In a Democratic Senate and\nTurning up any positive supportive way not seen in places like Ghana\nWest Virginia where a democratic senator trying to hold onto the faith that Trump won quite a bit and twenty six tied to the advertising like Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly thing when he Hoosier time with him and I met her and I didn't\nActually has a candidate you know kind of say I work with President Trump when he does what's right for West Virginia to theirs and supportive cone and that type of advocating one thing that

Pelosi practically all the ads that I have a negative reference to her really difficult\nTo find anything positive about and the policy in advertising and that carries from not just a Republican advertising but even democratic advertising that a little bit here and there during the Democratic primary races and\nWe found that you know about nine percent eight nine percent of all ads out there have a sort of an anti below the message so that really shows that Republicans have found her to be at the fact is sort of that and get his tales person for the Democratic party\nFor speaking with
