and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballot that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all\nAnd that's how we got we have today\nOr how about like in the coming years you get the sense that we won't have as many issues as we have now\nI think the problem is is that we have we have had this um ah up for a bill a bill has

October glad you could share it with a serious subject you're wire sexual assault victims not always willing to come forward the reasons are many years this weekend's Jennifer ...\nThe heated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex 'til many many reasons why somebody might not report on a on a fault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to help people go over the details again\nA and once you once you tell somebody once this law enforcement system takes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right\nSo now you you send it out there um you're telling people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blamed themselves\n[noise] well we we're in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that sends so or there's a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often that sometimes either somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong I went to that party\nI had too many drinks I walked down that street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should be safe in this world right in a perfect world but we're not and so there's the self blame like how did I not protect myself\nWe're speaking with Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth your article I thought it was interesting that people are more willing to come forward if there is some evidence of physical harm why is that\nBecause then they face feels like they will beep a week so the huge fear is that I'm going to put myself out there I'm going to relive trauma and no one's going to do it publicly people now nobody shameful details it's you know\nSex as a private thing to begin with even when it's consensual and nice and people are going to know these horrible details in my life and no one's going to believe me right so these these physical injuries that somebody has or at least physical ... they're they're visible press that um something\nAbout the victims you actually know the person which seems to be somewhat often if that person is a friend of relatives tumbling at all like that does that make it that much more complicated\nYeah especially for young people you're on a college campus are high school you see this person in the hall you see this person around the country club wherever you are and so um you're you're scared a that they will get angry at you and there'll be some retaliation I'm but you're also scared of being ostracized ostracized so\nUh you know will people again in this victim blaming society will people say that you know you you should be quiet and here's the thing I'm there's something called cognitive dissonance when something we can get our mind around some things that we're so someone says hey this person you know\nYou let's stop what we're doing right now\nAnd

seven percent of that that was raided junk or one notch above jock [noise]\nSo you know you take if you take your pick a we're worse off now than we were in two thousand seven and those people get in
