President Obama no one has been harmed here's Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today Nathan helps opposite to screen\nUltimately a lot of these actions aren't screened at all or when there's just so many packages and throughout the U.S that it's very difficult for them to actually you know apply X ray scanners for example to the with inside every single one\nIs it just uh the volume I think there's you said there's something like thirty four million packages a day they're delivered\nYeah and that's only UPS and FedEx doesn't even count the U. S. P. S. so all the mail that they handle so we're talking about tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday\nThat's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to put a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages I'm\nYou know that this is an order of magnitude that they can handle when the uh you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders handlers to identify certain characteristics that a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThis thinking about this is that they're just a dropping this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is

like so far to the the mail to the post postal service and show\n'em you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how to use\nThat just got through but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know there's just the volume is just so significant
