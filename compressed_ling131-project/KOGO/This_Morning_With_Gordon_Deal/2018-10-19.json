all corrupt together a lot of\nVulnerable Republicans had their names on those cells so I'll be campaigning on all of that but the message basically being\nYou're better off at a Republican leadership and Democrats\n... they are going further and further laughed\nUh how will he use President Trump if at all\nBut I imagine it will vary by the district that they're not going to need to have on our
