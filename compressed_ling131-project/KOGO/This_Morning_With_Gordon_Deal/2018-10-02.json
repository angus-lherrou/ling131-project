{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "But the thing is is that I've studied western astrology\nSo long that if people have questions it off and people say look I'm going through health or relationship money whatever it is\nAs long as they give me a month in your birth time if it's pretty accurate where they were born and they give me a background statement and they want to solve their problems I Will work with them to do it I'll find what it is to help them solve their problems this is a question of looking at a lot of planets and a lot of cycles\nAnd just keep working out until we can figure it out together\nLet's go to Carla in Bellingham, Washington birth date January ... Nineteen fifty five January twelve Nineteen fifty five first time caller for Carla Hi colonel welcome to the program\nHi thanks for having me\nYou're very welcome and would you like a question or just uh reading\nWell first of all night I was born in Los Angeles at nine twenty seven yeah\nNine twenty seven PM or I Will make it a little more accurate inlaws okay\nAnd then in general reading and um I just wanted to know what I asked that way okay or with\nPositive aspects in just the general reading mark and again it's January twelve Nineteen fifty five and nine twenty seven P. M.\nI thought it was am was at the Emory I'm Carla ... yeah\nOh sorry well that's okay no hair bear with me Carla finally you got something wrong [laughter] to me yeah I didn't hear one and then ah that's okay but Capricorn you know this is I Know so many people born with Capricorn so um my mother was a January eleventh\nBaby so uh [noise] anyone born around ... eleven January twelve you know sort of know a lot about that that vibration so one of the things for Capricorn again is Saturn is there okay I Do know anything much about astrology yourself miss\nOr a little bit more okay so ... I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are ... in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime Pluto movement\nToward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of linked to higher spirit so what the universe is saying is do some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be hard it could be music anything\nA hobby a craft an activity though that has deep and significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on and then you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line and called the trying which is flowing to your son to be an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or a doctor or or a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seated study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to you that Carlos next one may poor Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so\nWho is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea or money and should I moved to a different state I'm a toy and I was born in ... city court\nYou know where you are okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in a way of course and he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or know annoyed oh okay no problem [noise] okay you said money\nIs and where what state to live in which they deliver using Kelly right now\nWell first of all there is an even on my website it's called global hotspots ... where I Do this part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years in astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere on the planet to understand what's good and what isn't that California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union has a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as the son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your earth science and California's earth sign\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you of mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment so it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nScorpio is making kind of an unusual Lima to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection\nBut you want to learn more about mercury a threat to a great power Venus which is your son sign ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nIn fact uh the I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on that note when President Trump took office it's an article on earth of course news it was very strong at his inauguration it has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto ... are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on the truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\n... mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve or New Year's day to get
