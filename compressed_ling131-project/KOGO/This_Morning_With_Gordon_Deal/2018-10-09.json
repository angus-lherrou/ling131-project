GDP did go on a fault just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor because I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home\nBut not holy water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours a week\nIf if if I productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine\nA fixed by rote probably go to machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... faith than than being a wife hand now can't pay for and and ... ... ... ... ...\nAnd ... and ... it gets half ... than a ... fan\nTalking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're the guest barb is entirely right\nUh we are using a ton of his weapons which may kill decisions of course we've done that since landmines wheat crop we drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill\n'em so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decided that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit by Ron ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out June\nJune very simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income per capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened what if you look starting seventeenth fifty is shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen\nIs all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away enough food to feed the hungry people\nIn the world no of course you know it's the world's strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost photographer next\nNow you can get show updates and connect with other coast fans when you joined that goes to ... million Facebook they go to Facebook dot com slash ... but like but [noise]\nHe's ... and why he's San Diego live\n\nLiterally and figuratively or you know he he leads to ... the face of the federal judiciary and now after Justice Kennedy retired weighty ideological breakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so they he is part of a five justice concerts\nBlock [laughter] it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law but as we say and the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee parents and you know the whole process just isn't that sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and enter the challenge for that she\nWill be to to try to steer the court through these mean are pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another partisan body you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean it was rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\n[laughter] well I I guess a few things I mean there have been times\nThe cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big hot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll\nKind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not the sweeping so that's one way to to minimize\nThe court throw a little bit there have been other times it on on issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that so you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to ... but it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to\nOverturn roe v Wade for example meet in the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now [laughter] and so that may be a way he could try to deal with them a bit\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts\nIt's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name and now with all of a sudden the the high court is\nUnder this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process [laughter] they have something to do this for a little while but then that kind of fades [laughter] um but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar but Justice Clarence Thomas who had a\nSimilar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's\nIs probably easily the most recognizable member of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be\nJust to get back to judging cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold stances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFinds ways to moderate and the end to forge common ground with [laughter] you know with a cross section of people in the court and then maybe slowly that that sort of makes things a little better for him\nPlaced Brent that's Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall fourteen minutes now after the

core processor to get business done you heard the story of the state of limbo crash that killed twenty people in upstate New York just seeing this headlines\nAll over breaks your heart rate but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happen and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr juice or law\nPsychiatry and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly unpack and what they do if their heart goes out for other people but they also take on that cat the cat into their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and\nSo I wrote a book called the ... guy about these people who are so sensitive and so let me but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of an accident and horrific situations that they take\nToo much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted or anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and center yourself and realize\nThat you are not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system in the mirror\nNeurons are the compassion neurons in the brain for I'm I'm past that fry at such a an interest in the ... standing impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle here on mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries and if you realize that when you see something or ... something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I'd suggest all night and pass patients has to take news fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on for a lot of stress and negative news\nIt's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many facets go out in nature meditate exercise Brandon laugh so that's one tool\nBut also just notice it past traumas\nUm triggered for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident\nNo your pain about losing your father's triggers so you have to know that different though 'cause they could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current situation [noise] um and also doing a lot to sell nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news they're able to go outside um\nLearn now is a complete sentence with paper because their parents don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive paper when you hear horrific things in the news you don't want to be around energy vampires will I write about who destroying your energy\nFor we're speaking with Dr Judas oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on all this stress from other people's tragedy calls himself a long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely an empty house who don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book can be kind of course they never want to go outside they had panic disorders they can add to\nThis is a lot of the nation is because there aren't sensory overload all the time for it they're just being bombarded and don't know how to stop it\nAnd so yeah I Believe the empathy is a trait that it's going to save the world I really do I feel so strongly about it it's something I teach all my patients how to develop um and it has to be laughing to be able to be with somebody despite their differences and try and understand where they're coming from", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "09"}
