{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "That I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're gonna have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans or to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest\nInflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare they're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going\nThis bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nDo thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat will I hear that I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nAnd you know permanent quantitative easing just for birds the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just send you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty ... every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made\nWall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefitted corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited mainstream\nAll the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check their areas because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or do they get you're right that that's much better way to the point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George an area that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite in the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center banks thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to procreate money or pull accounts they're going to do for the more fluent in towns and those going to be in the end the bigger\nMoney center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union than you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOkay thank you and\nI think you just answered that part of one of my questions but the boy asked a direct when I got one right here on the line\nAnd I cannot act I'm like hey wait a second line\nRight yup they put all about timing\nIt all that time what am I gardening moment I call it um I don't know what I heard of that you just answered my question what\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much as ... as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYeah I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger accounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can't insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get out\nYeah sure going to be way less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit foreign depositors more Iceland went down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account\nWith your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good thing Carrie thank you were at a time Harry's website at coast to coast damn dot com up next a psychiatrist looks at the paranormal\nNow that

for\nJoining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura could just do the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\n... four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty or fix to us just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger I even though I covered it all the time and I know that right to to be a paper than ah it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people have\nGrown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though ... than it actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean that's certainly what I've heard that the fix for that is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really\nPlus slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that than\nUm with that said though I think we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense that it has been in the past and I think one of the reasons is what we just touched on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up and prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the high rates of negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has that rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway I'll full percentage point at least below where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they had their credit score up or something like that but there is almost nobody anymore was a strong incentive to find out\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing up price growth is slowing and I am definitely share a especially in some of the more\nExpensive markets um but I Would say somebody hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more about price productions\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI mean if you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump within and rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high but I Do think for buyers that just got\nExhausted I'm far from a bidding war Roseanne cash buyers that my real friends say that we've had in the market\nPay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that um their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so\nUm you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nThrough it already is actually um you know ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they've worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of gave a condom your workers are used to doing that\nThat has kind of shifted into the you know non ... regular payment cycles\nUm you know everyday workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't this happened for me so that conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and it kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby your company to pay you more frequently I think that would\nUnfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of the national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that that the benefit for their workers some of these companies um Iraq you know that that allow you to outsource both are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often\nSo we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nThanks Maria Maria la money market watches thirty minutes after the hour on this

know we are actually reached out to every state all the states in D. C. [noise] and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the states so far [noise]\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more districts spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant role district and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district ... you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out [laughter]\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as pure absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits at some of these districts initially going into it to save money or say wow you know what it really does help for the kids get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know there are noticing fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing they're at and hours\nAnd you know at some of these districts they had already met the minimum required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they uh\nWe're all five days if they were already seat in the hours there it's just basically add in time at the end of that day\nThat each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\nYes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nTo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day they typically have something in place rather they open up some of the school on that friday\nAnd they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's non profit that have like relatively cheap daycare and the and the school district might provide that meals\nA nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "San Diego", "day": "12"}
