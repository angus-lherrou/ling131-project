{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "The circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise]\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not do the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act and so they keep re creating that until they break the habit [laughter] um so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you\nKnow like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so that you can spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to think so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nOr his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them\nThat he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more and some variation but more specimens specificity as he got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime that the exactly what you're so what are you saying that that\nThat's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHad tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\nAnd the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the ... that's what happened um\nSpeaks to the age in which he might have been\nSort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced them to you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about in your interview you can have no answer you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the event live I don't doubt that he had committed pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been dead at inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while you have if you had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't like a nice guy and then he said he would that it is his the documentation\nOf his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carry to carry the sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents\nTrue in about his life the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together\nBeforehand before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point what year had gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no I'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yet um and then ... what\nYear he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere had been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse just a sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know the it it's a ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was ... or ... generally as a charming\nRight motives often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopathic or psychopathic have no fear ... know norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing that the parent about this the ... and the trade is that from his crime is it ... it was not\nEven not acting and fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with it or I discovered that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten\nYears or Fifteen and going to say well here's what the James's miss they miss this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about\nThis this crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they are going to do that and and there'll be right but\nWe had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacities so we moved on and part of the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions for sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most

out strongly against it\nSo it's a very divisive issue and not only is it sports but it's something that reaches the highest level of politics it's something that President Donald Trump regularly treated about ... spoke about last year so when you look at that at first glance might some strange but then when they try to or it starts to make more and more steps\nAnd you're saying that uh the there were a couple of dozen accounts roughly at the same time tweeting the same the same exact thing right\nYeah so there clearly is operated by a small groups of people who made up fake identities the whole point is that they want to be the county to look like they were real Americans tweeting about these things and you can that was true also uh when they were trading up political issues and so these people would\nBe you'd see a twenty four cats we the exact same thing at the exact\nSame time or within minutes of each other and they'd be very politically charged statement saying things like how can the NFL disrespect ... we saw that\nThe majority of the tweets that had a part of feeling or from what the researchers called white trolls which means that they were a conservative and they were and those people were typically very much against the protests are on the other hand you saw some people who are said\nThings that could be seen as inflammatory from the other side and very much strongly in favor of the players\nWere speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Andrew beaten his piece is called how Russian trolls inflamed the NFL's anthem controversy or this is still going on I presume has been no attempt to shut this down to be a violation of free speech perhaps but I don't know is there anything like that happening behind the scenes\nOh I'll be the cats that a reference happen shut down um but the\nThe the whole thing is though that when these accounts or shut down the new ones are made a new ones are made so what so there's definitely still what the researchers told us that those definitely count still being monitored that are that way then more recently on various topics whether that was\nThe Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick that will also drew a lot of charged reactions or the U.S open final between ... and and I only have thought that that also\nReally drew a lot of attention so it's clear that they see sports as a way into the conversation about American culture in a way to sort of discord\nSo they're obviously sowing discord of some kind of does that mean that the tweets are influential\nIt definitely varies I mean some of these cats didn't have many followers and probably didn't reach that many people on the other hand there were instances of a cat the cat grew to have\nA tens of thousands of followers and could have tens of thousands of retreats so it\nSo it definitely varies across a broad range of spectrum and of course it also needs to be\nPut in the context that that there's probably this is just a portion of the giants the of
