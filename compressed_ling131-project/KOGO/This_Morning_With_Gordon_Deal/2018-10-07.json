many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can't be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other either you need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a
