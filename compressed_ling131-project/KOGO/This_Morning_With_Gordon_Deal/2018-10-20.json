really doesn't rain and and why is that you can you know I was when I say doesn't ring you write many panicked people calling up what's the market doing today what do we do what do we do right you know folks that's the difference of having a plan and not having a plan\nAnd it's like it's like going to lunch and I'll give you an example\nJim and Joe going to lunch\nGym sitting down and meeting his friend Joe Joe runs in health faced frightened scared and looking at what the market's doing today and uh and this is concerned and asked his his friend Jim you know are aren't you sharing the same worried as I'm sure I\nKnow I'm I'm not I'm just looking at the menu here trying to figure out what I'm going out for lunch you know to what are you going to have I'm going to have the ... what are you going to have a job and what do you mean what am I going to argue freaking out the market's down eight hundred points well that's the difference Gen\nWe talk about this all the time and I I don't want to sound like a broken record but I Can't help it because it's thirty five years of experience and without experience comes wisdom and I just know that the difference to\nA successful retirement okay and elevating and maximizing all that you've done not just getting getting through but when you like to know how to maximize all that you've done in in in getting ready for retirement and that's what we help people do here by the first thing that we do is build this plan\nWe build your retirement blueprint and we help people retire every day and so this is also I Want to say that no embarrassment zone to that you you if you feel like you've you might not have made all the best decisions along the way well don't feel like the Lone Ranger a lot of people feel that way\nYou know

take Social Security and because of that there's so many ways you can mess it up there so much bad advice out there on on how to take it and and we don't want that to be you and so from Social Security to gossiping tax efficient so many people are not tax efficient\nAnd if you could be tax efficient by\nJust a few percentage points each and every year it literally means tens of thousands of\nMore dollars over twenty thirty your retirement and maybe a lot more than that\nAnd the risk that you know many people take\nYou know a ... as they're as they approach a retirement when paycheck stop we have to really have this planned built so we know the returns that we need in order to have a successful retirement so we're not exposing ourselves and our our rest of our life by\nTwo twenty five thirty five percent down side when that that might occur and markets go up and markets go down nobody knows when\nWe don't know nobody nobody does\nAnd so you have to have a plan built in such a way to take advantage when the market is good and know where that money sits inside your plan\nAnd no money that you need now to give you current income at money needs to be safe and liquid and not subject to volatility boy that folks there's just a lot to know and I just want to open the door as wide as I possibly can and make it as easy for you to get what I Know is super super important\nIs

they sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences\nCan change if you get them to think about certain identities or other identities so for example a\nYou know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and at one point and then worrying about\nThe federal deficit but political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because ... tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well thought out logical conclusion that we reach\n...

weekend with the\nBush for spending some of those how cool would this have been back in the day of four day school week Wall Street journal says more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to announce hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we and I actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the states so far\nYou know at the end though that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more districts spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant role districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district ... you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as fewer apps and says that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticed and fewer teacher actions as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction\nSo you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already feeding the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat does each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\nYes and and exactly and that I'm\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care you know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the\nYou know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at our his you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nAnd ...\nJust like that we had a nice special sort of moment together\nOf course they don't all need to be\nQuiet moments to be special they can be loud moments goofy moments sporty
