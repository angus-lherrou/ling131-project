story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christine explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular where races that were kind of at no word that they can they not cycle and people didn't think would become competitive back in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than people expect that they would\nAnd we've seen that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge and that may be at forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent districts you know he comfortably carried by where there is more room for a Democrat [laughter] to pick up votes if people have become dissatisfied with the president and\nSo one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people end up coming very competitive and that the
