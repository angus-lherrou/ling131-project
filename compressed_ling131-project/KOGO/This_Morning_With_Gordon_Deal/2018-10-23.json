show for Democrats to win\nAnd control the Senate and that the Republicans have only a\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep a seats and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there\nAnd find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um equation that they have to put together [laughter]\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bell weather states that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there was a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin I'll want her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and if she holds on it'll be because uh she Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the balance to be hugely important for the Democrats\nSecond one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson it ever got other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights [laughter]\nVery very uh a heavily funded from both sides and the wild card there all of a sudden is hurricane Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen as a leading the rescue effort or does it ultimately hurt him as people think the rescue effort has had been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need hold on to that when if they're going to have a chance they answered is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring ... Arizona is kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way in any election\nUh and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side and crush the cinema on the Democratic side in a year of the woman going at it a whirl Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnchors the cinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if there were cuts are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total\nOne of those probably going to have the Arizona so those seem like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury Siamese\nBut an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like a cabinet in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\n... that's a great question I it's hard to know is is um he's going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voted suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities [laughter] those are two groups of voters to simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance at a presidential election so\nAh the events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict turnout in the mid term there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm on both sides but in a to Z as in three weeks before the election actually showing up on election day or two different things", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "23"}
