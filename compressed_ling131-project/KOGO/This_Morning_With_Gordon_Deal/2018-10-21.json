I got lucky I guess one\nMargaret struck we struck me was one of FDR's cousins and aunts and uncles and she was a book on the fifth year anniversary of this stuff into closest companion in it but then to offer issue rich the phone\nIt's the president's fourth in bed and you still feel somewhat miserable scooters gone west to the without any warning who she felt it was noon also annoyed me is real from\nThe way and they're studying the children two or three PM we've shown either temperature of a hunger point to the doctor American powerful and it was a toxic poisoning but they couldn't describe it anything they know\nBingo smoking gun here we have the president at mealtime\nSuffering from a toxic poisoning poisoning in the White House\nAnd this was baffled there\nIt's it's a credible I mean would they were really really stupid really naive but maybe [laughter] I'm not going to get us but it just irritates me that our president would be taken away and it's incredible\nWhat we're coming up on top of the hour we're going to open up the phone lines questions and comments and I know coach listeners will be referring to have at you with the great questions and comments and we'll also talk about uh who may have been delivering\nThe poison uh at Warm Springs in Georgia the little White House\n... my guess the book is who murdered FDR the true story they don't want you to know\nAnd as I say we're going to open up the phone lines get on board to ask Steve a question taking us into the break the Staples Singers and I'll take you there on coast to coast am [noise]\nBut it's interesting because as you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the piece most Americans don't live and breathe politics the way Washington news beans who\nRight right we have to remind ourselves of this constantly you know those of us who write about these things are letting that most people out in America are not as obsessed with that if we are\nSo what what other changes I guess from the the last time survey versus the this time survey\nOne man has really changed and and it's been accelerating of at the last several decades is that\nA lot of these other identities that you know are not political in nature your\nReligion whether you are religious or non religious heal race they have come into alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you I'm In the Nineteen nineties that\nAh I'm I Am a non religious white woman that wouldn't really tell you a whole lot about my politics but now it is increasingly the case that non religious people are much more likely to be Democrats religious people and much more likely to be Republicans a you know we're seeing a much clearer\nSort of alignment along racial lines where the Republican Party is much more heavily represented whites non whites are much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nA so we see the pillow race along with religion or increasingly starting to get an education to and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more\nSo you know that there is to just that you know even if you say that your political identity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important tea increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nWell respected Emily badger writer upshot at the New York times and she's written a piece titled Americans either politics don't defined them but it's complicated use it to people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell so do you have lots of different identities at any given moment you know you have a radio show you are and then\nUh you know like you know from a particular part of the country is silly it with your home town and whichever one of those as important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences\nCan change if you get them to think about certain identities or for other identities so for example a\nYou know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that's one point and then worrying about the the federal deficit but political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions\nSo that suggests that you know identity is very kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well thought out logical conclusion that we reach\n...

intelligence could help the process since it has a goal of fixing problems Rob explain\nWell thought that's what got me worked up I think a lot of people watched that a confirmation process some kind of realize the process itself was severely broken I'm I'm a guy with the power in a high as it is it's trained correctly is that it's unbiased\nOr it could do a ... any claim against the candidate\nBased on publicly available and private information and do so in Buffalo securing confidential fashion so neither that complain and lord of the candidate was put at risk and so much of the drama\nWe saw on television which\nDamaged both participants significantly\nI could have been done at a time and then the decision could be reach a with regard to whether or not the candidate or they complain complain that was the Bible about doing so much damage show we pretty much get the same outcome but up but the damage to both parties would be added that ended the appearance of the court\nWould have been or what have been through a stage they reduce them and that's what I was really for it it it helps you get to the meat of a problem provide\nYou with the dice on how to resolve the problem and does show without this massive amount of drama we seem to be enduring I'm pretty much every major decision\nRight so how could it potentially handle do accusations from the Nineteen eighties\n[noise] well I I I think that that that what it would do is do we go again in the end and certainly would take the evidence that was presented and would determine whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nA of a decision so in other words if if there was a\nIt looks like his ticket her case we had a complaint and said that there was an assault attempted rape but no rape chat no location no time no all the things that would fill out a case even on the next day had had happened the day before\nThat would allow prosecutor to bring the pet the case for\nWas named exist and and so I Would likely come back very quickly and say okay we we need these elements otherwise there's no point in frustrating because there's no there's nothing there's no substance here and so it would allow they went dead at Senator Feinstein got dismissed she'll know way back in July\nIt would say okay this doesn't meet the threshold you're going to need these five things you're going to need to go out and get these five things before this has to pursue their horses we saw none of those things\nHad been achieved by the time it finally went on the television and so we're eater reached the threshold or it doesn't meet the threshold of it doesn't it would've detail what you needed to do to get there and then if you didn't want to do it\nThen that's your decision you can certainly still go forward and and tried to disrupt these people's lives but if you want to be successful while you to prioritize your resources\nTo see if you could find these other elements in and and make the case rather than just get everybody angry\nAnd we're speaking with tech analyst Rob Enderle a principal and founder of the ... group he's written a piece about how artificial intelligence could help clean up something like the Senate confirmation process for Supreme Court justice um I guess too though\nThere could be accusations of biased in how the AI was programmed right or how data was
