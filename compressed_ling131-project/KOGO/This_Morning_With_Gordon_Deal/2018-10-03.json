Europe Russia China we have for us growth are stable force so there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited ... forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last couple of hundred years\nOr any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet oh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nObviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the store called accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big port [noise] um in in the northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what the what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps where a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky and say no doubt this a lot of\nDemocrats Sandler harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all\nAny time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factors why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite max that we used to the many years ago we're seeing an animated cartoon but there's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThat this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm fronts hurricanes tropical storms low pressure is on coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd is being blocked by harp technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up\nVery powerful I Believe they can play out as much as three billion watts of power and can he the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they can stall hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather\n... when the only hear about it in the new one's good Steve's reaction to the roost like you\nBruce that something might have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some cloud seeding attempt spoke to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he go ahead\n[laughter] well as you go higher than man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat the weather pattern is being Gail engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George just recently at gentleman on a show\nTalking about the ... put out a video called Franken's guys and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people have race so much hair\nShoot more about the fact that they're doing is going to back off of it now what they were terrible is going to back off Kim trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown two sides I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to great and\nOn the stock market on whether they want or again that they want to intensify the hurricane through the heart and on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the show the crops which is going on there almost becoming a thing\nAnd they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a man ever come up with a man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power simply okay now I Do agree with that but the thing with Trump I'm proud of having it got us out of that climate accord sham meant that what they were doing gripping the industrial nations away rather than get into the pockets of the little league\nAnd mean China's there with her sky completely with collusion not paying a dime and do it either Russia but the United states of America but it got a point I don't know I don't blame a crop one bit I grew in fact I'm proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nWar with somebody

prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related use to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tail what are we seeing your\nWay you know there's a lot of a concern in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that a lot more freedom\nTo swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always paid ... they've always got a lot of money in Washington\nAnd in state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate Goldman election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that it would just show though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying\nYou know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money you talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates and other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party a you know the Democratic Republican governors a tax cut that basically support uh getting\nGovernors one party or the other or if they're similar groups for attorney general and state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little ripped showed of a company as large companies are saying we don't want to use money number one or more area\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase a backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produced this report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at best that you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen companies have been in the ass ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a\nHow and where and when they spend a and in some cases how much they spent on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example that use that published a report on the political activity and now they don't or their reports or watch a informative than they used to be a new company is now in part because of new company is joining the U.S and be five hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their uh to display the political spending reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies stay in the index it turns out that larger companies and come up in an index longer\nTend to do better at disclosing out when where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies referenced Lowe's and they're the big home improvement Jane ... who was a mayor do they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a less for coming in the in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what their restrictions are on a on political spending in talking to me they said their position hasn't changed they still\nAre don't contribute to political campaigns candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like Fargo and four and five twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language but Adam ... versions\nOf their annual political suspended report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of that say don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or and they told their trade associations not to use the upon tore a lecture activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a member that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal
