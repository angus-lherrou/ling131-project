{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "She'll be manager confirmed that they know that all of this worked out beautifully [laughter] needing now\nHad she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on\nAugust Eighth two thousand six team because this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nIn this book was reaching out that's partly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes you seem to be the you know like the public is for these dose\nOf the main thing is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go to Dodger\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goals but like other little girl that bounces all isn't she do I'm like no leave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nAbsolutely not if they are they're just kicking you and your tricks or it's here they are in prison\nHere by their own their own their own minds they're they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not\nYou know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time\nTo actually look for those if you want to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nThe transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter it lends itself\nTo the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast rate and it\nOnly I call it the God like it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks in the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now onto them did you mentioned non hunters ... region the gas goes follow you right yes they do\nOn line two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would go on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter]\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them and the streetlights will flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even Boulder when new I Walk around there and I went there once a month and doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the top of the buildings you got a lot of history\nYeah yeah you too I mean I heard that sometimes it just happened to some people with the ... of the life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd and the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just a few I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh\nHave you tried to say it's happening it won't so\nYeah they're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic trick them no really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there are there other\nWestern towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's the essence\nPart right there oh yeah but you know the family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even as to part with ... with the infrared cameras at night time that you can see light up\nWind up with a red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains very sacred land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine of they were right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of a war of the pikes peak they believe was the naval of the universe I find that fascinating because maybe at the court will\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very funny I Love this stuff [laughter] pikes peak it's very popular and it has a lot\nOf um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it and um we're going to take a break in just a minute maybe you can tell us a little bit about it after the break okay now the name of your book again is called the ... latest one you have four\nIt is I think for a long time this is politics have stay out of work for a number of people are told us that they don't but it's it's no longer possible that you you do bring in a hotel to the office that the issues that you're you're discussing outside of work of course are going to become a into the workplace and one person I spoke with made a point that we don't we don't have a third\nPlace for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time so of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is this the company is called the Bateman group and offices in New York and San Francisco and what part of the company sent out a memo or early last week just outlining the resources and benefit to the company had to deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker him they'd had had to set up for the past year\nBut the flack room was called hash tag resistance and it was a police for workers there to really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people wanted to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates and what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it about\nThat while we're speaking with chip cutter Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said that he had to tell his his small team that there really is just no place for political bakery network\nSo he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he could take care of him he's the one who pays for salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens this week to determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then we'll go from there\nHow much of this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues that but I think that we we heard on\nOn all sides of this that they were men\nKind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think and then we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nDid not feel that uh just kept an eye was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic lines that was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out at work where we spend so much more time\nNext year but Wall Street journal reporter ship
