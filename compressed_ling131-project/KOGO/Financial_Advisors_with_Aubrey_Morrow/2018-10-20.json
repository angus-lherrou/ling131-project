this crazy crazy stock market ah we've had some serious cuts the last couple of weeks we've seen we have a lot of panic or selling by investors and buying opportunities so I think by professionals which we work with by the way\nWe've had a crazy volatile um bungee cords stock market um save you have a big background in the equities when I ask you kind of your take on it but again I'm reflecting\nOn that too many days ago we had to market was down fourteen hundred points in two days route we had a the market up around five hundred points the next day down three hundred points uh uh the day after it and now the market's up and down and up and down I guess that's the one they called it markets a\nWell here we are again it's another choppy week and I think every so often we need to have these kind of weeks to keep us from getting too complacent expecting things to just go up and you know I I I kind of watch the news out of the corner of my eye\nAnd I think that's about the worst thing I can do I have a lot of different clients that have different ways of relating to the market's going up and down in my ... happiest clients we talk every quarter and we look at the statements and we ... we evaluate where things are at\nThe the people who are the most stressed out of the ones that are sitting there with the news on and watching every pick her up and down and you know that that's just crazy\nWill save obviously our emotions cause us to make financial decisions fear and greed\nAnd certainly we've had greed almost for the last ten years of the bull market has been literally almost up I'm not a straight line but if you draw from where we were June of two thousand and four and two thousand five and two hours and ... all the way up the line and it looks like it's a rocket ship taking off\nBut again we know we also have these corrections every three and a half to four years we haven't had a correction in almost ten years\nSo one ... procrastinators would say well we're going to be having a drop in the market we have a crash probably not a we don't really know uh but again if we take a look at the fundamentals we have a pretty strong economy\nOr if you don't believe that to take a look at your your your reports on your stock senior bonds are certainly interest rates are coming up the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell the new Federal Reserve chair is is wanting to raise short term rates in order to slow down a booming economy and we've had ...\nEat rate increases Steve since two thousand and Fifteen I suspect we're going to have a few more and I think raising rates actually in retrospect is probably good because whenever we have another down town and our economy and the feds can lower rates if you keep rates too darn low kind of hard to lower rates when you say Steve\nRight and and the problem or the issue is is is rates rise\nIt attracts money and where does that attract money from bullets attracting money from the stock market\nYou know we've been we've the market has benefited over the last decade from low to zero to ... low interest rates and money is always going to flow and it's going to get the best return that's been high tech growth kind of names and that's shifting to more fixed income and maybe value stocks and pay a dividend\nAnd another thing as her interest rates Steve obviously go up people paying more if they borrow
