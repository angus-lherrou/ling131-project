what whatever you're doing right now if you want to learn more about real estate especially if you own investment real estate\nOr we would encourage you to join us that are educational workshops a is mandatory a mandatory registration by the way I'm unfortunately we have a food we have handouts\nAnd and unfortunately or fortunately maybe bill and dug we have a lot of people that just show up and ... they have to stay in the back of the room where we have to go the other officers and pull out chairs\nSo next workshop is Thursday November the twenty ninth so if you own investment real estate or we're going to tell you today what we talk about in the workshop\nAnd before we do that to the table or let's talk about a looming potential problem or that may be facing our wonderful city that started out in Berkeley which is now in LA which is now in Santa Monica and potentially what could be in a national city\nTo that's right and that and that's what we are that's why we're packing a house on these workshops operate because uh you know there's a lot of concern about uh the potential of rent control through proposition ten which is a state wide level or they're calling it the Affordable Housing Act\nA but it's nothing more than the repeal of the cost of ... that's proposition ten at the state\nAnd then of course but you mentioned national city there's proposition W\nA which is a pretty harsh rent control a act it national city and of course you know if you look at what economists are saying if you look at the history of some of these measures the reality is is part of the apartment association were were promoting um\nThe reality is that neither of these acts will\nUh increased funding for affordable housing or neither of them will force local communities to build the housing approved in their general plans and and they won't provide immediate relief for people facing higher housing costs\nThe bottom line is for our listeners that are not involved in rental real estate at all the bottom line is we have a big big demand for housing ah it costs a lot to buy a home today a ... unfortunately a lot of people having to rent today\nAnd they were ... more of a demand for rental properties and and rental units than it is a supply\nSo traditional ... will supply demand situation the bottom line is it's a situation where unfortunately and I'm not going to try to take position\nThat um if you own apartment and you happen to own it in and the naturals\nPretty and you've got a whole bunch of folks that want to rent your your property you're going to raise the rent to the highest price is going to pay\nAnd unfortunately what's happening in the last two years there's been an increase in ranch or we're sixty percent of the last two years and it's been a devastation for the poor folks that are renting\nAnd the landlords are going to maybe get it to end the chops if this a prep ten does pass we'll talk more about that and to make its educational and the question is what Judy Chu will really talk about the different choices that you\nJust joined us You're listening to the financial advisors were moral or having a great to in Studio guest duct tape or the rental owner advisor also has a designation C. C. I. M. which is the highest designation any commercial brokerage business and also built Exeter there's only done about a hundred and fifty\nThousand ten thirty one exchanges and we'll let Phil tell us what that really means in English and if you don't if you don't own property if you do on property you may want to make a note to join us at our workshop on Thursday November the twenty ninth and you can learn more about that and make reservations\nOnline if money talk radio dot com when you talk radio dot com go take a break and come back for more federal news radio six hundred pages [noise]\n\nWell I mean I have a twenty four hour from her for that one of my family\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the\nFolks walking back to the finish you might you might [noise]\nAdvisors I'm Audrey Morrow joined in cocoa studios with duct tape or see see I Am a real estate owner advisor and also bill Exeter at ten thirty one exchange ...\n... do you watch the real estate market on a daily basis just talk about the changes maybe the swings we've seen in the rental market place to commercial marketplace and and clearly a all people have to do is look at the freeways until there's a lot of new people moving to San Diego huh\nAbsolutely huge like you mentioned outside we have clear skies it's it's beautiful weather and it's a great place to live we have amazing job market there's there's new jobs coming into this market and so a lot of people want to move here of course there's a housing shortage which is not only in San Diego but throughout California\nUh our market in particular on the apartment side some say we may be close to the top some say are we may have hit the top some like I think you mentioned that we might have already gone over the top uh you know we ... we won't know until we get a few years down the road\nI think he's shaking top da da and when I I think we're using semantics here but\nI think we've seen the top of the real estate market and it has mainly ... to do with interest rates I think he looks at the second quarter that's when we started to see a gradual increase in interest racing we all know if you or a bar\nAnd you have to get a loan and your interest rates go hire a you've got a larger mortgage payment that could be dampening the real estate market if one wants to buy a property\n[noise] could have been certainly puts a little pressure on the the ... side of the transaction although I think they need to realize that interest rates are still some of the lowest interest rates we've seen in years\n... my first one was in Nineteen Seventy six my mortgage rate was twelve percent yup yup\nAnd I think a lot of people who are first time buyers are thinking oh my gosh the rates have gone up these are still phenomenal interest rates\nNow ... and the market is still strong uh there's there's more properties on the market but there are a lot of pending a sales right now a values are still strong somewhere or somewhere in the two hundred three hundred thousand per unit range so that you know those are strong numbers for San Diego apartment market\nWe'll be voted voted on November six or he's concerned about that and he's going to vacate his entire building because that measure is very very strict\nOr it has come down from an Alameda measure\nOf the city of Alameda which has a really strong rent control in place and they basically just copy that bill and are putting it into place and what it does is it limits uh landlords ability to do a number of things that allow them to run ineffective business\nTerrible situation um and and again it initially if you're the rent or for example in national city you're saying hey this is going to be great I'm going to be very happy my rents are not going to be going up\nAnd and conversely just like Bill said if you own the property of you can't raise rents are three to four percent per year just to break even\nFor your maintenance people and all of that stuff and if a rent controlled again they'll get help me because I'm On a novice at this but the CPI it limits the the increase in round two point seven percent something like that so if you're the landlord and you can't raise rents more than ... to point seven percent two point eight percent and it cost you more to maintain the property\nYou know what is commonsense say I'm just going to let it I'm just got all got do anything I might have male on your off on my property ... and ah then who's going to lose\nRight utilities are going up water water is going up or the cost of building is going up we have a ... a shortage of skilled laborers so all of those things are causing the prices of a investment properties to go up yet many folks so\nMany folks are uh miss understand the bill they think that it says that you can raise rents five percent that's the max like you said or you can only raise it was the CPR the cost of a ... index is and our consumer price index is and that's a to point seven percent\n[noise] interesting situation is going to be interesting on November seventh to figure out what's going to be happening and unfortunately you think there's always a win win or lose lose this was a complete lose lose situation\nAnd usually it sounds appealing but it's not going to be that appealing and and um I don't think it's going to certainly solve the problem\nIt it's things that we talk about and the education or guys that we have on our educational workshops we've had I think for standing room only nothing but wonderful ... comments from their workshop mainly because we have nothing to sell except education\nAnd Doug you are the moderator and maybe we can share with our listeners right after the break as to what the topics we cover what education people get and then obviously one of the solution to the people think about hey what am I goals for my real estate I must say neutral planner for almost forty years\nAnd when we do this thing called personal financial planning with people and their families\nIf I find that people own investment real estate or could be raw land could be a single family property could be a condo could be an apartment building I say let me ask you a couple of questions about your property what are your goals for your property\nWhat are your short term goals what are your long term goals and people look at me like I don't know I hadn't really thought about it\nSo we have seven or eight different strategies that we go through and talk about pros and cons of those strategies and if nothing else we just given terrific great education for the people that own rental properties again the next workshop we're having is a long time off is November twenty nights folks essay Thursday\nAnd ... and ah we may be at eight oh five and governor literally in my building and I rented oh five and governor just west of ... and we can see two sixty or Seventy people in the room we normally have Seventy or eighty or to let them from eleven thirty to one thirty\nAnd again we have a speaker Doug paper as you're hearing today is the moderator he's a rental owner advisor bill Exeter is president CEO of Exeter ten thirty one exchange services and we're going to talk about some of the solution to build and people say you know\nI've had it property a long long time just going to sell\nI got a lot of profit I Know it's worth a whole bunch and I'm just going to sell it out well there's a reason we have a CPA on the panel is well
