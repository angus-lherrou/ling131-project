parish\nSaint Mary's followed up on the outcry by thinking those who may cold rational incoherent comments about\nUnbelievable I guess Mr Trump finally made a deal with Canada and Mexico\nAnd all of a sudden boom the market took off like a rocket ship this week unbelievably new highs again and then slowly backed down because Federal Reserve is trying to slow down our wonderful economy by raising interest rates and there's kind of good news and bad news\nUh depending on which side of the equation you're on with regard to the raising of short term rates which will also convert into long term mortgage rate\nWhich by the way as we know is having sort of a negative impact on our local real estate market and mainly when I say real estate market I'm really talking about homes buying homes selling a home\nAnd quite frankly we've had sort of a a slowdown of um of a home values ah appreciation is some of the home to appreciation is literally about a two year low that's not bad it's just the fact that's what's happening and so more homes are on the market today mainly because of interest rates\nAnd uh I was with my mortgage guy neighbor yesterday\nOn friday afternoon chatting and he said already you know mortgage rates are only way up he said we're right around the corner from my having a five percent third year fix\nYou know folks he'd go back about six months ago a thirty year mortgages about four and a half percent somewhere that range it jumped up to four point seven five and a right around the corner will most likely see maybe by the end of the year mortgage rates of five percent for us\nAnd say people going up that's terrible that's terrible for Forrest I mentioned to you during the break\nA uh my first home I purchased in Nineteen Seventy six which I still owned by the way I might thirty or mortgage was twelve percent pours what do you think about having a twelve percent mortgage five I'll take it all day\nWell twelve percent sounds absolutely crazy and I believe the tax rates were pretty wild back then as well as as well\nI think it's even though a lot of jumped the reality than when we're buying our home and and rates were jumping on us about three years ago er during the process or you know a few bumps in your interest rate can certainly add up because most homes today to get in require such a large downpayment\nIn a very large alone many cases operate five hundred thousand dollars for a starter home so a little bump to five percent mortgage really adds up to people so it can ... disqualify a lot of potential buyers and his off into the market\nAnd I think you hit it right on ahead what's happening when people are trying to buy a home they first have to qualify for a a mortgage they're getting again the higher the mortgage that the rate the last number of people were able to cool qualify so that's kind of what's happening to the San Diego housing market a forest we have had a three workshops in the last couple of months\nFor people that own appreciated real estate or people that own that single family home for many years at condo for many years that apartment complex for many years\nAnd um we're having some looming negative uh clouds coming over our head is probably going to have some reckoning on on the fact that that ... we may be seeing a thing called rent controls on the November ... ballot by the way\nSo again over the six folks are not too long in the future here maybe thirty days or so\nUh there's going to be a ballot filed with proposition that a lot of people don't know about is going to be having had a real terrible impact on the rental housing industry again proposition ten it would repeal what was called ... at a ...\nWhich in Nineteen Ninety five restricting CD from enacting rent controls in apartments built to after the February first that year\nSo our workshops I had been standing room only we met over two hundred people in the last two or three workshops and we're going to have one

wheels and trust and then all of a sudden now we have a debt that we need to make sure it's only good debt that we should have by the way is dead in which we conduct the interest for those key things

the financial planning process maybe you can remind our listeners the importance of planning their financial future\nAnd they will spend a lot today on the upcoming workshops this month on a forum on\nThe fact that if people don't appreciate or real estate some of the ... best moves they can take and we'll talk about that um after you remind folks on the importance of planning for us\nYeah I guess that's the key is is planning and more importantly is comprehensive planning right so at several several years ago I read when I was at San Diego state um within my emphasis financial services and I painted a certificate and financial planning\nAnd that was really the foundation of of um you know the beginning of my studies for this and that's where we learned about the various sizes of the pie as you just call that ... that can include investments\nThat can include retirement planning that can include income taxes\nEstate planning and insurance all these various things and more Aubrey\nThat we deal with on a day to day basis or we have a thorough understanding of each one of those topics but more importantly we can bring it all together so that we can make some good
