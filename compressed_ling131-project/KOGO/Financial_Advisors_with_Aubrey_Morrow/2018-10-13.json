sitting next to my right in his ... studios early Saturday morning another certified financial planner a drumbeat for Mr forced video morning ivory ulcer\nHow does it go well it goes better because um when I see him there is is like soups what's going on and I assume or if you're listening to the news and watching what's going on if you have any money in the stock market you probably had a little a feeling of fear of desperation and maybe a little panic\nWednesday and Thursday but again I think it was a minor hiccup and forest during the break we were chatting about probably why we've seen in the select up and has to do with interest rates\nAnd we've often said and when we have a booming economy\nAnd certainly we've had a bull stock market a roaring stock market almost for ten years and at some point at old bulls have to take a little stopping a little breather look over the fence and figure out what's going on\nAnd for us I think the ... ah took a little break on Wednesday and Thursday they stop a trotting ahead and they picked over the fence and it said you know I kinda like renting and so I took off running again I think we just had a little worked in the market I don't know\nYet and nobody knows Iran and we haven't had a significant correction probably since January ... earlier this year and it's easy to forget about that so if if the market's been moving up up up it's almost healthy to have a son volatility and and uh some corrections so it's just part of the market cycle\nAnd you know force you look at it whenever the market goes down it means a lot of folks are selling our arts maybe the trading or the to the uh the automatic tracking trading is triggered are either individual people are saying hey I'm getting out and again that's when it ... sand and little panic since then\nAnd then obviously you take a look can always remember when you're selling somebody else's buying and many times for us the professional money managers are certainly buying when everybody else is selling so where I think we're about back to little optimism and little euphoria and quite frankly I think we kinda have blue skies I think um\nWe're still going to have a a decent market\nOr we certainly have an interest rates are coming up to slow down an economy\nWe've often said when you're racing down the freeway\nAnd you're doing a thing called speeding and you look and you ... the way in the distance this blue light is on I have a tendency to take your foot all the ... century you start slowing down\nAnd that's exactly what the Federal Reserve is doing they're raising interest rates short term interest rates to slow down a booming economy\nAnd I think for us we just had a little sampling the fact that markets are don't always go up trees don't always go to this guy and I think we had a little I'm a little a reminder a Wednesday and Thursday and I think we're still going to have a strong market in my humble opinion\nAnd I think the fed at you know with their announcements they they're trying to avoid future bubbles and they want to see if the stock market can stand on its own two feet a combination of things you know we're not seeing as a a corporate buybacks corporations buying their own stocks as he did that in the past\nUm again when you had the largest buyers of stocks out of the market it you need to have a new new a group of investors to to buy some of those stocks that the sellers are are getting at it's so again it's just a combination of things\nAnd for us I think how it hits us personally I think the little drop and the market on Wednesday and Thursday which was kind of dramatic and when you lose ... thousand points you go whoa what's going on forget the points if the percentage\nAnd as forest mentioned whenever we have a correction if I can use that word generally that's ten percent or more of a drop in the market and forest we didn't get near ten percent so\nYou know when something drops to ... percent six percent or even five to six or seven percent doesn't really matter would you buy something on sale when it was a discount if I were six present probably not but I'll tell you what it was a reminder\nIs reminder is a terrific time just tore evaluate how much you have in the market and clearly a depending on the color of your hair it depend on how much allocation you should have to quote unquote stocks\nSo when we all have always done this thing called personal financial planning and we certainly like the stock market we love our real estate or don't talk a lot about real estate as a as we continue the program today\nBut with regard to your stocks you want to ask yourself three questions folks water my goals and objectives okay well obviously if you're investing the stock market your goals and objectives to make a profit right you got to do something got to take a little risk\nAnd then the second consideration is how much risk can you handle well there's all kinds of risk and everything\nThere's risk and putting money on a manager jar and bearing ended up back yard it's no earnings interest at all on the on on the on your money\nOr certainly having money and a checking account or you're basically zero interest\nUnless you have a little bit on a credit union or if you have too much money in savings kind of money market account too you're probably not him earning a what the purchasing power and the money could be\nSo we want to diversify your investments based on your goals and objectives what risk you're willing to take and when you need money from the portfolio that's what financial planning is all about is all about looking at your investments\nCertainly planning for your retirement\nIdeas to reduce income taxes are making sure anything you own that has value makes you have good insurance on that\nAnd certainly making sure your wheels and trust her up to date and then obviously you have any debt any kind of a debt are the only good debt in my opinion is a dead end which you can deduct the interest so typically associated with real estate that's all what we call personal financial planning\nAnd if any of this will be interesting to just check our website out this afternoon Sunday or anytime at money talk radio dot com three words money talk radio dot com is our website\nAnd I'm looking at it right now and this early Saturday morning
