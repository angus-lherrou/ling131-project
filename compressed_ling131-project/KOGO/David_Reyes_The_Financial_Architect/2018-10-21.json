restructuring pastors in ... and now some of those ... or or returning back to the church and my question is I don't have fellowship at these people I I can forgive him and I'm called to do but I don't trust them and I feel so protective of my church\nOK rightly so I'm ... ... they're running your church in in what way um you don't give names and super specifics but\nThat the pastor was not to put it in a way should have been and um it was found to be that they really did wrong and and that we had to we had to restructure because people are willing to step down to the the church and to keep the congregation I'm intact\nOkay so this was a big deal it's changed the ... the entire structure of the church was changed\nWhat horrible and the people that have the problem or they\nThey left and created their own church OK and many of them left that and now it's kind of cutting back then [laughter] almost two years okay so there's a lot of it that it's still there and they'll feel that okay\nBut the but this is the beauty of of this type of relationship if people can make mistakes I guarantee if you look down on the pencils in your house Tracy they have a research as well right um everybody's going to make mistakes\nThe the purpose of the body of Christ is not to this is you know there's\nYou've got the reformation and you've got this split of the church and you've got to know Catholics and Protestants and they butt heads on occasion and then the Protestant started making little factions of Protestantism and they've got groups here in groups there now they start butting heads and it continues to go on and it's the most frustrating part\nA of Christianity\nWhen you were you looking at it so the purpose of it all is for you to all remain tied to the essentials\nAnd those essential store who do you see that I Am a mother the trinity all of these things the resurrection these are the essential or the face the rest is peripheral garbage it's just stuff\nIt's stuff that the that that you're going to have to get\nThrough it's like in a marriage or any relationship um the essential or important that you love and that you trust each other and that you are are focused on the same purpose of happiness and a gross so in the church you have to be single minded and those things about God not just the church\nAnd if somebody makes a mistake and there's a huge division in our wounds and there are scars and then they come back you have to at least allow that you're going to take place you have to\nAnd many many have come to a third to a church and if you ask for forgiveness or have an orange and acknowledge good at what they've done but I'm asking about the knot\nAnd well then you confront them and that's my question I have\nAbsolutely you up to them and say listen but you put it on you ... them it's not about them this is about you wanting to heal through it um and don't put it like they're doing well usually listen I I'm having a real issue with this and we were here and we do it here and don't feel that you're better than them 'cause you stood\nBecause everybody will make a mistake right but it's that you're there and you had to watch it and in your pain to buy it\nAnd and each taught that out with them and so you feel like\nYou know the church needs an apology or something like that but talk it out to be brothers and sisters in this face and and not be pushing against each other so much uh but the division that happened before could have been the logical now it's emotional political get over that move forward\nI appreciate you taking

it's complicated use it to people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell so so do you have lots of different identity is at any given moment you know you have a radio show you are and then\nUh you know you know from a particular part of the country is silly it with your home town and whichever one of those as important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences\nCan change if you get them to think about certain identities or other identities so for example a\nYou know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that's more important and then worrying about the the federal deficit\nBut political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their views shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a very kind of fluid thing\nThat shift depending on you know the context that you're in you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well thought out logical conclusion that we reach\nExample Emily
