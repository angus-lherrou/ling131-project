looks at their life and says it's getting more complicated and every generation would be correct to a certain degree\nThere are new things coming your way every moment of every day and you're bombarded with stimulation more than any other generation\nWith mobile lack accessibility to the entire world mobile accessibility to your job\nThere was a time where you came home from work you spend time with your family and nowadays you come home from work but you're still tethered to a mobile device whether it be your phone whether it be your tablets or even a laptop\nYou're always around\nA portal\nTo your boss friends family whoever might need you write that moment used to make a phone call and then she couldn't get the person you'd have to wait for the world is in a in a speed\nA little speed location right now that is all about getting it done and getting it done now regardless\nThe feeling so may be well family first and you gotta take care of this you know take care of that but really\nIt's not how it's structured anymore it's structured if something needs to be done with work it needs to be done now\nCompetition is different life moves at a different speed and in that process it can be very overwhelming and taxing on certain types of brains there's just people that move but certain speeds\nThis is how they do things this how they do the right and in that process\nCan feel like you're being swallowed but I assure you there is a way to at least\nCalculate what your skills are and what you can and should be doing at any given time and apply them and then after that point you can tip your hat and said this is this is what I have with is just my ability and if they don't like you can move on\nBut if you like any other race if you feel you can't run at the speeds that are needed then\nDon't size wind speed that you can because you will always be best running of the speed that suits you\nBut that must be balanced with gross as well and ... and looking inward leads saying okay and my learning a skill or it's just pushing the universe another direction to get better at something else or to expand myself\nAnd if that is the U.S answer then you need to stick with it but if not you move on and you find your proper speed till next week remember these words I Am with you oh where\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you considering shape to secure your valuables

workers there\nTo really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room and if they didn't want engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates and what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it about\nThat while we speak what you've cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital of the fact political debates shake up the workplace I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said he had to tell his his small team that there really is just no place for political bickering network\nHe's off and telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who pays your salary and not talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance that they're going to see\nWhat happens is we can determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have\nAn open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or want it to talk about politics and then we go from there\nHow much did this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues that but I think but we we heard on\nOn all sides of this that they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nDid not feel that a cat and I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out of work where we spend so
