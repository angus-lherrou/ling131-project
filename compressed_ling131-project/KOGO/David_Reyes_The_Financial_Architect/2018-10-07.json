I've said many many times that scripture is all about relationships uh-huh it doesn't seem and that's not to be\nSome new waging modern thought of wiggling everything down to relationships it's the truth if you go through the beginning uh an Adam and Eve to the book of revelation it's all about the interaction with one another and interaction with God\nAnd getting\nTo the the focus is to the center of relationships is the key to everything in life everything\nYour job your well being ah your home the peace at home all\nOf those things really center on how you interact with others and can relate to\nAnd that means by relating our means not only are you know if you think one sided plea that you deal well with relationships with on a relationship\nIf you understand people take time to understand them and in a case of being a parent and leaving money to your children are putting it in we will I Know that there's a lot of factors that you're thinking about I'm dealing with\nUm well this person took care of me to this person took time with me but there's also things you have to think about when you're gone and the relationship that that leaves 'em the rest of the family members in in the siblings and how they could build\nBribery or a book that rivalry or interaction cause problems in the interaction of those those siblings\nAnd so your relationships never stop isn't that fascinating that even when someone passes on\nThat really the spirit of what they bring to the family unit whatever continues to be a part of that family and often times there are um parents that just treated children or a favored one or did something\nThat that continues to last how many times have we had a phone calls on this very program of people calling in and saying something happened a long time ago the parents are even past and still permeates\nOr has a driving force\nIn relationships this very day\nSo obviously relationships are incredibly important and sometimes people get wrapped up in the fact that their their chemical or chemistry or you connect with this person or do connect with that person but ultimately\nLearning how to deal with other people learning how to understand other people's needs and who they are as a person is part of communicating and part of having relationships\nThey need to take time\nTo understand and to learn about those people as well and I encourage you to do that in all walks of life family friends everything but I Know that there's a lot of noise out there these days and a lot going on in the world\nBut I Want you to remember the

produce paper trail\nI mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\n[noise] um yes there's so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots digital those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have a ... need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um state the county election officials are looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter that are in cyber security journalists also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so vulnerable\n[noise] oh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nOr in that case I'm sure everyone recalls the dangling Chad wow you ... that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington DC decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all\nAnd that's how we got from what we have today\nOr how about like in the coming years you get the sense that we won't have as many issues as we have now\nI think the problem is is that we have we have had this um ah for a bill a bill has come in Congress ah since um let's say four or five times a since this all happened in in two thousand trying to mandate paperback up an audit insistence and lawmakers do not pick it up\nThere's been absolutely no interest in this book primarily

today\nCredit scores have hit new highs were buying more and stocks keep rising life is good right but could it be too good yes says Stamford Conn economic business trends analyst he shakes his head at the amount of debt that we've accumulated he's based in Long Beach California Sanford what kind of economy are we looking at\nWhat we're looking at a at a comedy that's doing well I Can't argue with that number is is doing well but what are the debt bubble car to me at all bubbles eventually burst you cannot keep going [noise] economy can't keep going by adding more debt faster than the economy is growing and that's exactly what we're doing and the quality of the debt now\nIs actually worse than it was at the peak in two thousand seven right before we had the financial crisis\nSo we got a real problem now you got a debt induce financial bubble outlook you think this is going to go on forever of course not no bubbles go on forever they are actually they all burst I Can't tell you when that no one could tell you where right through it with\nThe debt it's a government and consumers are we just talking about bad can so hard that you know\nIt's it's above I'll give you an example um all that both from municipalities and corporations are the debt now over a little over fifty percent of the debt from is a power these that'd be like a couple of government state and a corporation corporate that\nLittle over fifty percent is rated junk or one notch above junk when to me that's all junk in two thousand seven about twenty seven percent of that that was raided junk or one notch above jock\nSo you know you take if you take your pick a we're worse off now than we were in two thousand seven and those people get into bond funds better be careful about the radio and those bonds because one of those bonds are very low rate it they could be junk or a little bit above jock and there are a little bit above junk they're called investment grade\nBut to me if you're a little bit above junk it's junk\nHow did we find these new depths what happened\nAfter we cry and these new ... what was the question again\nHow did we find them well how do how do we get back to the worst then we weren't oh seven\n... because the ... the fed lowers interest rates near zero for a long for a number of years so people went out to borrow money like mad they issue a debt and they just had a dead end this financial bubble and the economy did grow at work\nBut all all trends come to an end they don't go on forever and now the fed is reversing itself and guess what interest rates are going up the ten year treasury note went above three percent it still is about three percent if it starts climbing higher or get out of the people borrowed money at low interest rates lower rates going up\nThat that will ... the financial bubble especially if the ... when the ten year treasury note goes about three and a quarter percent and it's that's going to four percent the game is over that's it the gay financial gains come to an end\nAnd this one eventually come to an end to this is a matter of whether you're going to be caught in the middle of so start preparing for yourself now because this they will not last forever\nIn Sanford Sanford John economic business trends analyst from California twenty two minutes now in front of the hour on this weekend\nThinking about life insurance
