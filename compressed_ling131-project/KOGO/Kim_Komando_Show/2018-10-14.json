P. N. app so and I'm using ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling blurry I had\nGood his fat differently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on a public why buy everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay so if you are typing in your bank account your password your Amazon dot com pass whatever may be\nIs that anybody can just pluck that out of the year so and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that it's gonna use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us is traveling in the airwaves\nYou won't be able just pick it out OK okay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and\nGermany oh how fun Oh yes I Can't wait I'm\nSo excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're this is like the coolest thing you're going to totally love this to mind when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pick her daily square or whatever it may be\nThat you hold up your phone and his augmented reality so you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing I Do are you went to like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to Sweden which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right quick song and you know if you could do a food toward any of the city has been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your wedding\nOr a then there's no word VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of as secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks but she can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go to your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport\nBeard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else you get that out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back\nThere's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right and they're all coming
