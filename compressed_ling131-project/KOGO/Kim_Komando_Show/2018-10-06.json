future generations your kids grandkids anybody you want to help in the future\nYeah I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom and that's that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually came up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that's one of the things that that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection and we've joked about it a few times Larry where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I was down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked for like eight am like noon because that's when the satellite was over ... ... it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve\nYears ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this and it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather\nAnd I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know he had dial up Internet and now it's just in the\nPalm of your hand but we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge can really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for price really come down to you\nIt it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know and my grandfather taught me this when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from buildings skill a great place to start that is at the half day class we've got a few

him to that point a financial freedom\nLet's consistency Ryan most people come in and they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have to be willing to commit ... coach ... be at a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next\nYear really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you if you're not happy right now than you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody\nWho's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact I'm Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expect in a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and as you said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nAnd I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nA and he brought up the the the the inverse sight of that too and he said if you follow somebody around who is
