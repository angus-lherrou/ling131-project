thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting is we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from him rather than the hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly\nAnd it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one\nAs a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's going to work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was\nMake the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken Troy retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life the drafter\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of past is one of these half day classes to get your phone's writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started\nRight now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight seven seven three nine nine eight seven to three that's eight seven seven three nine nine eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said it earlier on the show as it doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goals that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags loads of these of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about this time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you'll come after the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right\nCause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now\nAnd simply imagine with their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money and that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation\nAgain if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and poster Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave of the time to do that I said it's great just send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before or after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did the big trip through Europe and I remember him saying you know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great uh after having a great time and\nThat's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we
