have a heart attack years before the event ever occurred that's right well\nThanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries as it shows up on the tea hard scams now most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently the CAT scans\nTell a doctor when an artery has already become narrowed by ... well that's the problem\nThey say now that they can figure this out even before

robotic sex toys that's right [noise]\nThey wanted to open a love dollars brothel and she will soon so that people would be able to use its human like dolls\nA kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie west world K Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visited location then they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits [noise]\nSo Houston's city council actually updated a local audience to specifically banned individuals from having sex with a device examples\nA human being [noise]\nI Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't ferret away to tax the robots but those of us here at the
