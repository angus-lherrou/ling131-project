{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KOGO", "content": "They simplify trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam side and it said this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just the transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nI think that's an important concept to remember because\nIt's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our account right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets or a conduit just hooked us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up we all go there to hang out and what do we do that well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks\nShow up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market but it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and\nA lot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives to most of us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially with a correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic\nAnd the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year ... out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but he used to always say a that a goal without a plan an executed all plan is this is a dream you\nKnow go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan\nThat step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because\nAny and we are we going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick and all of a sudden everybody is going to plan out their New Year's resolutions and I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow and\nThe only educated plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in\nThere and you know ... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time\nThat you're putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and we have to do what we have to do what it takes to accomplish that goal we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is that at one of the half the classes and we've got this tack this stack

with a reason why they can't do something and what have you only need it to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now either procrastinating of watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money\nSo I asked students all the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you can quit your job or if you could spend more time with your family a lot of our students now are starting to actually\nMake money while they're on vacations I have June one of my students recently and she sent me a postcard from Costa Rica and she said it's great I'm playing golf this has been my dream but I'm also trading on the trip and of course when she came back I asked you trade before after and she went\nBefore of course so she'd get up early in the morning because the one thing about having an education\nAnd being able to trade it any time with an Internet connection that computer is there are several markets to trade it's twenty four hour marketplace right now so the rules have changed and people are finding that they can take back their lives\nAnd actually start doing some of the things they want to do as opposed to working for someone else which is what is the required to do of themselves\nYou know there was a there was a book I read a little while ago called the world is flat and it talked about a lot of outsourcing in a different kind of business strategies but it talks a lot about technology and how technology has really kind of level are made the playing field\nA very level and it makes it makes it difficult on some businesses to be competitive and it makes it easier on other businesses to get going and that's very true inside of the markets because with the with the Internet connections that we have with the data streams that we

you again\nYou know what's going on now wait wait wait well we'll we'll use it and I talk to you again so you've been a caller before\nLong time ago I did a long time listener but I'm ... called the number\nOh well thank you Jim I appreciate that appreciate that\nI listen to every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good way to either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should've minding my own business but you didn't\nI didn't have an acquaintance too recently\nUh reconnected with a a daughter he had in the Barry when he was in the military and Europe okay ah and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born in the early ... connected to the people and his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on it and she was like a no avail us failed miserably\nOh man so you're going to wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years older so All right so she's Twenty years old\nAnd that's right 'cause you said Nineteen Ninety eight um\nYou couldn't really find anything about her leg on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a a Facebook account that looked like it had origin or January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social you know not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your friend more about her or you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or what\nAll the above okay she does for for money or they're not rich by any means ah ah the family just there's a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nOh I'm sure and then all of a sudden you have a kid coming out of the blue right and you're like okay I I'm just a bystander and all that well here are a good friend I mean you're worried about right new automation I was\nI was concerned in a regular show a I don't like she anybody get hurt a ... and and I heard you talk about these things before in\nA different stage ... can get a lot but I used to ... dot com yeah these books Google a and I'm coming up with nothing\nYou know there's also family tree now where okay you might\nBe able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nUh and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer or a glass of wine okay because Germany click and other places are and then of course there's the surge which is another place for you to attract but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman is that\nYou know I'm surprised that that you know he can't\nFriend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media because that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and the you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start stupid around and see if there's anything else out there\nYeah I don't think he wants anybody ... and\nOh he doesn't want to know\nI don't think he wants to know\nWhy you have a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that uh\nShe is his daughter and I don't she's got a very good background and I think she's just to get which can get\n... well maybe you know you can do your background search and you can see what you can find online\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's gonna be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nI and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she asked for money so that this way you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember it or it sounds like he probably I'm going to tell you now that I think about that\nOptimal health introducing new
