laughing she says no I'm not a millennial\nNoticed it by year I was born in Nineteen I'm not one either was vices who you're [laughter]\nMaybe three but but he and my son is a gym there\nRight in K ... but he wouldn't know how to burn a CD because of who is mom it\nYes and and dad as we've we've made CDs and he's been down in the studio\nAnd things like that but then it may it got me thinking about other things that millennials and guaranteed generations ears\nAre not going to understand for ever use correct one of the first things that I think would be is is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now is television\nCommercials my son watches everything on YouTube right he doesn't know what cable television is it's all YouTube but then we hook up the ... and we're going to watch Sunday Night Football\nAnd it goes to commercial things like what's going on here so we just kept us can we've asked for this\nYou know what that's a problem I mean I mean you 'cause you're you're absolutely right because in and you know where he has never really had that the a commercial\nOr if he does few commercials at only Fifteen seconds yes there is what I have many cars there is a skipped right once you watch his five seconds of it right\nI'm In fact when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like and I'm sitting there going to\nHave you fast forward [laughter] and she's my father is but she goes they don't have that here they don't have a WPN and yet can skip the commercial I'm like oh my gosh how are they living what is going on foot\nSea with us it was just a convenience that's nice let's let's let's DVR something has kept the commercials for the younger generations it's a given I Know that's kind of understand about my son is he'll say I want to watch a movie and you'll run and get his eye that we have a six foot five inch television in our living if I'm not bragging it's huge\nHe doesn't want to watch it he wants it in his lap and his hand on a small little eye pad it's so interesting to me and you know what though\nThat it is fascinating and and as he gets older you'll see different technologies and how they're using it versus how you might use\nIt and I want bigger I mean I'm a huge TV and I see those eighty five interests but they have a fries like trying from drew in over the now in\nGeneration in K ... they're they're not really watching YouTube anymore\nOr do you do yeah\nHow are they getting their entertainment that videos on Instagram Snapchat\nBut you're not going to find a a limitation program there are they you know what they he watch all those friends are watching some boxing match on YouTube okay so if it's an event they'll go to YouTube yes\nBut if it's you know no longer they sharing viral video and I think we've talked about this before like each channel having its own app\nAnd so with my ... my my ... my in laws have cable so they've given my son their password so he can look at the Disney Channel and stuff like that on his lap he has no interest he doesn't want to bump around from ... to ... now so I don't I mean these companies these companies are coming out with her own apps but it's not going to work well you know and speaking of\nTelevision member Saturday morning cartoons oh of course it was the bad I Know isn't that humid and I just remember being a kid Saturday
