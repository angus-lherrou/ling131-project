C. P. E. R. dot com because they do something a kind of old fashioned they have a hardware leader board they call it based on their reviews\nIf you is that right at the top on the page PC per dot com\nIt's the hardware leader board it's they have a four different systems you can build starting with a foreigner fifty three dollar low end system and all the way up to two thousand eight hundred and fifty dollar dream system and they list there don't don't tell your kid yet but they list there all the parts you're going to need you need a case you mother board you need a processor\nNeed a video card you need memory you need storage or hard drive you may or may not want to get a sound card depending on\nYour mother ... cartoon network or most of the time you need to get a power supply case usually has the power supply built in so they it on their on these ... on the leader board they say well foreign fifty three dollars here's what you should get for two thousand eight hundred fifty dollars here's what you should get\nAnd uh\nIt's a great way to get the kids don't tell me about this yet maybe if you have trouble finding it but say what do I do we need to make a PC and these can learn a lot and then okay let's choose the parts because you know how much do you have to spend how much do you want to spend on the process or on the memory and much memory do you want all of that is a great learning experience\nHowever [laughter]\nIt is also front with peril because uh you put it all together and it doesn't start\nA boy and then then you're in John's Josh is a situation where [noise] what do I do now and it's all on you again great for learning but not so great for your productivity [laughter] might be might be one of those things that you are\nYou know you do once and then from then on you go to do that but that would be my advice or our show that they brought to buy carbon I now this is important in the maybe this is another part of the puzzle\nAnd nowadays knowing how to put together hardware maybe not as important for a young person coming up knowing how to put together the software had a security system how to make a system safe though that's all important and certainly if you are\nAre in business the most important thing is known how to keep your data safe because that's it right that's your business your data is your business car but that is the data protection platform\nFor businesses with powerful server backup and replication solutions perfect choice for business looking for a single vendor solution\nTo cover all their data protection needs you get yours flexible scalable server backup everything's secure by the way with end and block level encryption indeed duplication which is very nice saves you space in network bandwidth\nReal time replication of super cool that means is always being backed up\nAnd went cloud fail over it means is ... you say you get bit by malware take good news flip a switch your back up and running\nBroad support for over two hundred operating systems applications and platforms and again having a single vendors nice 'cause when disaster strikes you don't want to have to be making a lot of phone calls carbon ideas as secure trusted provider\nWith award winning customer service seven days a week learned more about the carbon I data protection platform for business carbonate dot com\nDawn and lot point they California ... report the tech guy\n[laughter] how are you I'm great how are you\nOn science this is my first time I was a because last week you were talking about scams stands how you get scans knowledge ah UK but I never got so today\nI learned how to make of it 'cause I signed up for it fairly like online survey yeah [noise] and I was wondering\nIs they can't they can waste your time but\nThey're not a scam you if you don't give them a credit card if you don't give them too much information so there are certainly people serving all the time and that's you know a big part of market research and men you know that's all legitimate the key with scams is at some point they're going to ask you for something you don't want to give him a credit card number access\nTo your computer software that you have to install don't do any of that ... the tech guy [noise]\nDoes not work with my hair and he'll I\nAnd I will not do that [laughter] the depot off it's been nice though [laughter] this IPO now does she mean the Santa Fe depot does that what she's I don't know what she means in Home Depot there are a lot of good deep those out there\nThe depot like like what does she take these ... thoughts are now she has a a there is a point about how hard it is to use transit to get around the commute absolutely right\nSo before um er at some point to another clip the Andrew Bond captured was of pat ... who's a Republican state senator and she said you know like\nOh you have to sit around for a bus set maybe comes once every three hours and you know again it was just like this kind of disdain for public transportation but they are talking about you know like how difficult\nIt is and how bad things can be here and there solution I suppose is to not this is like the one to ever and\nThat and it's not going to get better\nAnd that was what was yeah I mean the the I think a lot of transit advocates would gladly acknowledge that there's there's two infrequent buses there's not enough stops there's not enough alternatives it's too hard to get around during the day but that's part of what their point is is like look\nYou know ... we were concerned about your heels and your nails sure your hair your hair yeah but you know there's a lot of people that can't afford a car can afford all those things in a way to get around as well they need to do these jobs is workforce housing issues and stuff but yeah it's amazing how like um\nThere's so many things\nThat people on both sides agree on with this issue so everyone's like yeah the roads are bad and we need money to fix them everybody agrees on that it's only like where the money should come from that's the disagreement yeah and it's the same with public transit like yes buses should come more frequently and they should be easier\nTo use the trolley um I don't I don't know how to fix Diane Harkey hair I Am not sure about that one but like again the disagreement is just about how we should fund these things or what sort of prioritization we should be giving to them yeah and\nSo then it brings question of like there's no argument about the gas tax it's like you have to write transit now there are some ambitious plans adopted by the city by the Republican mayor by the way to you know actually encourage and try to get a certain number of people to take street or to take a alternate transportation now I'm\nOne of the things that's interesting about this though is that from the left the concern about the gas tax is that it funds to many highways and not enough transit right and in like that it's it did these plans that are built that these are that this is funding is too heavily streets in car focused\nYeah and it's not just with the gas tax but it's like sort of the same argument we've seen play out with all these various plans that address\nHow we get around you know the sandbag master plan that were lost its about weather front loaded too many roads projects and that's been tied up in court and so any time we're having these discussions that always comes down to the\nThis matter of priority\nYeah I think it's important to remember to like there isn't actually like a set of projects that's gas tax project yeah exactly no matter what either side wants to tell you you get one of those mailers and say like this or this or aren't going to happen like that's not really the case but it's also not the case that they will happen without it you know like the\nThe so there are a bunch of transportation me all these places like San Diego lay out their needs and their plan and the gas tax is just another source of money among the two or three or four needed to fund All right so like\nA locally there's highway projects and there's I Know that there's one big effort to increase the frequency of buses downtown and there's a few other things did like need money yes or maybe half filled or three quarters filled and the gatherings would help them get farther if there is no gas taxes on like that they'll fall off the plans they just won't get done\nYeah similar with you know trans man measure area which didn't pass you know I think MPs is looking to at possibly flood its own tax and they would all ostensibly go toward a lot of the same projects that everybody agrees we need that shift that eat\nAnytime you have these massive infrastructure projects you cobbled together like ten different sources the funding to get them done right\nThey were also a railing on that project and he wrote about about the\nThe sand I wanted to do a a headquarters down around now they need a place to park all the buses that go downtown and then there's all these port a potties out\nAnd people in the bus drivers go to the port a potty feel like well we need them all in one place if we're going to make them all in one place might as well put our headquarters there and that project or you know there's a lot of bipartisan support for it but there's a lot of concern about they're using eminent domain to get the land [laughter]\nBut um uh but they took they weaponize that argument as well right yeah [noise]\nAll right so that was one of the Californians of the day this was a let's go to the second one\nYear [laughter]\nRon Roberts who who we're not going quietly into\nThe goodness of political career\nCounty supervisor run Roberts is the last few months of his term is county supervisor\nAnd there's obviously a big race to replace them between eighth and Fletcher and Bonnie Newman in his last week John Brady who helps run the homeless choir voices varsity choir you might remember them from political test they opened up Darrell Steinberg sing and dance with him did you see this yeah\nOh there's like a joyful moment yeah he was\nHe's just a likeable person involved in this great effort\nYeah he was like a a snapping his fingers and dancing to lean on me so ah John ... I met him he was there he helped coordinate the choir so he gets up and he talks about supporting or one of these projects the county was going forward and then he he says look I also want to say\nThat the county should do more for homelessness a it shouldn't rest on these cities including the city of San Diego and uh you know a few of the things like that and supervisor run Roberts wanted to work with him yeah\nIt is unfair to shoulder the responsibility so heavily on the city of San Diego and as mayor Kevin Faulkner thank you for your time\nTo respond to that I'm ready to jump out of my seat because that is terrible already\nBeer baloney oh Pierre baloney gets\nThe bed so he was like you kind of caught off guard right so they so Robert goes into this like you know in the past and thinking about how much money how many projects and all these things that the counties done to serve homelessness yeah and then uh this guy's like oh hey look I didn't mean to attack you right\nI mean did say like you know you should do more and there's this big crisis it's not that he wasn't it wasn't a pointed to criticize it was like the cities are doing a lot you need to do more yeah\nBut also you know since we only heard the tail end of what he was saying I I just want to put out first this guy was formerly homeless himself he now runs a group of people who are currently homeless and formerly homeless this well he was speaking on world homelessness day\nAnd he was also speaking at like a county supervisors public comment you know a forum designed for precisely these types of issues and concerns you to be brought forth in front of the supervisors and he did it in an incredibly measured and polite way\nWho was fully prepared now on the measure of like the spectrum of public comments and how he's at these public meetings and the level of vitriol that they can have there's like\nThere's like you know chamber of commerce you know prepared statement by the leader of the chamber and then on the other hand there's some real crazy things that happen so he is like like maybe a step\nRemoved from the chamber of commerce here or threat yeah he'll point one yeah not at all [laughter] nowhere near tin Robert ... takes it to the left and right away for sure and here's more\nIncreased our homeless for teams that are out there is our emergency response team psychological ... that I'm not like listen to me sorry 'cause she made a statement that shows a listener and the tweets that are coming out of some of the mayors have no idea what this board is doing I'm tired of hearing it\nTired man he is tired of hearing the tweets [laughter]\nSee the ... so he's referring to literally lose nine criticism yeah ever level between these two agencies right\nMary Kevin fault or the other day must have decided like\nWe need to county yeah\nFifteen months to decide we need to county were doing all this work on homelessness they need to step it up do more work on homelessness right yeah so they do it in a classic Kevin Faulkner city of San Diego mayor's office way\nIt's like tweet storm and it's like five tweets and\nThe ... the top of the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Voice of San Diego", "city": "San Diego", "day": "22"}
