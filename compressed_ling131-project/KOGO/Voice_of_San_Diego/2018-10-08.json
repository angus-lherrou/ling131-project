I'm Sorry yeah and that adds up over time when you're getting a little frequently yeah so\nBut you don't want to let me tell you you do want those updates wherever you really do I know yeah I don't worry about the low memory a ... most of the time those updates update you know they'll downloaded first and that may be where you get that warning but as soon as the updates done to delete it and they'll have not occupy any more than they currently do\nMost of the time updates don't add to this amount of size of these apps or the or the operating system but they are very important as long as you can run them as long as it happens it's okay [noise]\nIt does leave downloaded folder the ... the ... or the update that you download it and you can delete that okay\nYeah it will delete it by ... automatically oh oh okay yeah I Know windows they always do that oh that's\nRight windows does not it as soon as you have a lot of room but Android understands it in many cases the spaces scanned so it it will delete those don't you worry if it doesn't you can't go in the downloads folder and and with impunity delete anything that's stuck there\nIt can handle a ... thirty two gigabytes card\nWell that's another solution now the thing about cards to remember is when you install one of those cards most of the time apps and the operating system they don't live on the card\nBut what you can do I don't know if you're using it for music you can move music there you can move picture is there any media\nAny data files can be moved to the external card and that will free up space uh once you put in the card for instance the camera will say oh I see you have a card you want to put pictures there and you just say yes and that will free of space but it doesn't you can't put apps there\nRobert it's great to talk to you again keep calling okay love hearing from your point the three fifty seven the other way fuel our show they brought you buy carbon\nIn the premier data protection platform for business with powerful server backup and replication solutions\nBusinesses need a single source for their data protection so that if something bad happens you only have one phone call to make only one site to visit that's carbon night real time replication means you're never Adel data and if something terrible happens you can get back\nSo there was a recording supposedly somewhere and and there was an eye pad in over here and I figured out where the recording on that I had was good I'm good I'm good at I've had so you'd like we're like the IT guy in the room yeah thanks yeah yeah\nSo afterwards it was in little area and after we went to the Piazza ... Familia uh this nice new place they changed I guess it was date street into uh\nUh they closed it and turn it into a plaza and it ... it was just\nIt was just teeming with people there was a band playing there and it reminded me of Europe in the sense that it was like nine thirty or ten but there was kids out playing it just felt like a like an air but they built that old reader building till greener building is now a four or five story you\nKnow a housing effort it was beautiful\nAnd I was I was like this is crass proud because my friends in there and I knew was there I Want to go see it and it's just very proud that the city cheese is I've I've been kinda on high since then and then I found out this week is the orchids an onion where they give out an orchid for the best architecture and an onion for the worst\nAnd I found the ... or ... pointed out the nomination for this plaza the ... million but it was a nomination for an onion\nBecause ah it it's it's not a real Piazza according to this person a Piazza supposed to be like an intersection of different streets and it is at the intersection between two streets and they were\nReally like a long actually there's a word it and I just wanted to do dramatic reading of this if you don't ...\nI was going to wait till the end I just want to say I think I Know who wrote this do you I think I Do there's a few facts here there are a few statements about the ... that were said to me by a person just\nAnd maybe everyone just has really strong Piazza\nTheir center [laughter] I just think there's some identifiable complaints that I think they're either made by this person or this person is speaking for a person a show listener\nYes okay is it it it sounds like this person you'd be useful in the escape\nHave ruined we needed to know who wrote this I Would have some shit [laughter]\nSo All right here's my start [noise] [noise]\nThis is a there are upset about the naming of it yes you know the fact that this happened in little Italy which is supposed\nTo give a taste of the Italian experience as irresponsible we're witnessing the mallet\nVacation of the city it is not mall that mimic city centers but the opposite sense malls have become the locus\nOf the communal experience the improper naming of the pie odds are familiar with guilt will give visitors and future architect I Love the\nThe children [laughter]\nTo worry about the children the wrong idea of what a Piazza is\nSecondly let's talk about the design if Italy had a nightmare it would be the ... the scale of the street lights on steroids the maximum security prison lightning\nBritain lights lighting a grotesque plastic fountain ... does have become have state the bench is not cheap table I Will not even mention the design of the buildings overlook the million everything is wrong here like that for the baby was\nClearly the best except for the ... which is acceptable adequate\nHaving I never liked some things so much that somebody so much ever yeah\nCan I so I have a conspiracy theory like nationally that the Daytona five hundred actually happens like every three weeks that's just like how often I feel about it it's like I have a\nBay buccaneers always play the Atlanta Falcons\nYeah yeah that's a good one too but so I Swear it up or goods and onions happens every two weeks [laughter] I'm sick of hearing about it [laughter]\nIt's I think that's true I think it really has every two weeks [noise] so anyway the pieces fit to athletic\nSo I I have great chairs so I brought\nLaunched the other day yeah and I didn't want to eat it at my desk and so I was like I'm going to take my brought lunch over to this Piazza mhm\nAnd if I'm honest I was kind of trolling I was like armed with a with like on bridge ready to be unleashed because you have things well I thought\nThat what was going to happen as I was going to sit down at those table set or by the cafeteria where like the older the for the food a hall is they're gonna boots and they were going to say no you have to buy something right at which point I was gonna say I was gonna make a scene right that if this was this other public space or it's private space you're basically\nMike Pence going to an NFL game it was a lot like that but then no one said anything and I just ate my lunch quietly and left and had a nice little after ... yeah I think a ... it was it was it was great it was really proud of San Diego nice\nSome of some of these statements aren't totally wrong the street lights are up absurdly out upscale\nOver the code look at the ... the ... they they're like they're the suitable for like a space\nEight to Fifteen times that big comedy what really life but I think that helped [laughter] not that it's ... like the debate it's so big oh here's the comic Lee absurdly big and the fountain has really ugly and real tacky\nOkay well it was ... that goes into the building so this I Want to thank you [laughter] [laughter] that's how I thought I knew but let me be clear\nYeah the paving is except it's like that but the ... yes\nAll right so this weekend we've of were a little loopy\nBecause we have been planning politic fest Saturday I'm In one of the debates we're going to have their please come politic fest dot org but you know what you might be too late to actually register online\nDon't worry don't Fred just ... just come we'll ... we'll take care of you at the desk there we've got a like seven hundred registering right now we we're we're actually going to\nDo better than break even we might be able to fund some investigative journalism which is huge so they do or not like the Texas Tribune a trip festival which made like two million dollars ... yeah that that things bond room now this big deal now [noise]\nAnyway we've got a great a bunch of things one of the things we're doing\nIs a debate hosted by Cal matters about rent control so prop ten now I got at his desk from L. D. the other daily him because uh we sent out a message that said that prop ten would\nWith draw the cost to Hawkins rule which was a moratorium on rent control down through Liam said that is incorrect so tell me dear sir\nWhat is Costa Hawkins and what is proper ten Scott Hawkins\nIn a state law passed Johnny five that did a three things are set at three things\nAt brevity to cities and counties for playing rent control like I said in three key ways one is no record Shaw single family homes so no city or county can do that\nSecond is it gave landlords their rights are maintained their right for them to be able to reset rents whenever rent controlled tenant\nMoved out that's called the vacancy vacancy control yeah right so I Try not to use that for his allergies 'cause no one that's a nightmare ripe right so but the idea is that if I'm ... controlled a unit and I'm there for three years\nNext person comes in ... can charge whatever he wants in the market or for that person and that new person would be under the new record troubles\nThe third thing is that it's such a date for when\nA cities can limit rent control or implementing are actual on building building up construction so for the most part of the Nineteen Ninety five the year ... you cannot have record showing buildings any newer than that\nIt also set in stone the years that cities ahead existing wreckage will policies um uh uh had their their construction year except for instance in Los Angeles or the city cannot update it's it's ... for any building bill after Nineteen Seventy eight\nBecause the cost of ... so there's a three sort of key things so you can and some cities have implemented rent control regimes that work around those provisions but they're the three main provisions and it does prohibits that are most ... most forms of new record ... going in\nSo very limited okay so if a city wanted to do rent control right now yes what kinds of things what could they put in they could say the\nRecord showing buildings but before Ninety five okay invited those buildings were not I'm a well provided us in a family homes so apartments\nSo the baking the issue is really interesting a lot of I I managed to evade the other day about this in in one of the points that the landlord represented was making was that\nThat vacancy thing was important because they want to be able to reset after somebody moves out to to clean up the the apartment to improve it invested in it but if they're stuck with this deal price then that would inhibit that sort of change that sort of a progression right\nNot only that but I Do represent their huge allocation issues right so like someone who's out and there's all of a sudden in a super high cost area a new record drought apartment for super below market rents\nHow does that who gets that apartment right you know and obviously that I think advocates of want that to go to go to a person of of of less the less means but there'll be nothing or sort of be very hard to stop a landlord from giving it to anybody ... right and so um that's a that's sort of one of the more you know during the ... at the state level\nThere was some discussion about some give over the year\nLandlord seem to be willing to do something about that sort of because you know stands now I'm recognizable simply die out buildings will get too old they'll be replaced and then all of a sudden you won't have racquetball anywhere even places that already have it now because the buildings will will go away", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Voice of San Diego", "city": "San Diego", "day": "08"}
