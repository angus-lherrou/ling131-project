infrastructure in urban areas and areas near transit\nOr there's four hundred and fifty million dollars also to encourage homeownership for low and moderate income people people doing a little bit better and a three hundred million to build housing for farm workers typically we'll see farmers up in the Central Valley although we actually we have some air in San Diego\nUm they don't make a whole lot of money as you can imagine and so finding suitable housing is somewhat difficult\nUm this doesn't help everybody of course but it helps um estimates show thirty thousand renters seven point seven and a half thousand farmworkers Fifteen thousand homebuyers and three thousand veterans\nUm and that's that that's a people say we need it because it'll help that many people\nI'm buying a home\nAll right so opponents say basically that it will only generate to kind of a small blitz and new housing construction and therefore it's not\nYou know worth all the debt that the state will take on a the riverside press enterprise a its editorial board came out and said that more money might not be the answer and instead you know we should be slashing regulations that made it make it harder to build\n'em some of the opponents include John Cox the Republican candidate for governor and the Republican Party\n[noise]\nAlright ... is also a bond related to housing 'em but this one's a little bit different I'm so several years ago voters approved\nA tax on millionaires um this was back in two thousand four and it was meant to fund services for the mentally ill and then we ... up that tax I'm back in twenty sixteen\nUm and the idea for that was to spend some of the money on supportive housing for the mentally ill\nThat plan has been held up um because some opponents sued over the use of that money they said that supportive housing is not\nUm how we should be using that tax money and they it was supposed to go only towards services and so I'm all that money has been held up in a lawsuit and counties are just sort of sitting on millions and millions of dollars that they're afraid to spend so\nThe legislature said let's put this on the ballot get voters to okay directly the use of that money on supportive housing you know so the idea is just that I'm with voters giving an affirmative yes to spending\nThe money this way or the state can borrowed two billion and funds um that it would pay back using that millionaires tax extension\nArguments pretty simple uh supporters say supportive housing is the best way to reduce homelessness among the chronically mentally ill\nUm the state Democratic Party the chamber of commerce a lot of local leaders from San Diego on both sides of the aisle have endorsed this\nUm that includes Toni Atkins tug floria Myrtle coal brand main shine um the California association of counties as a supporter remember counties are just sitting on a lot of this money that they're kind of afraid to spend less they may be sued\nThe opposition to proposition to is fairly limited um there's in fact not much of it um but the criticism out there is that\nVoters knew what they were doing when they set aside this money for mental health services and they wanted services for people with mental health issues not housing and those are two different things and the intent of the voters was to do one thing that the other and this bond sort of overrides um the previous bon language\nOr one named opponent is the Contra Costa chapter of the national alliance on mental illness they said it's um\n[noise] you know it's difficult if this money gets set aside for housing it's actually difficult to build 'em housing units are for mentally ill people and so if we think we're going to suddenly be able to build that sort of housing it's actually going to get opposed by ... and and other groups that don't want these\nI'm kind of facilities in their neighborhood and the money should instead be spent now an\nServices rather than on housing that may not get built anytime soon or ever\n[noise]\nProposition three is a water bond it's ah that sounds familiar we pass day water bond in June that was a four point one billion dollar water bond\nWe also passed another water bond for several years ago and twenty four team that was a seven point five billion dollar water bond this November's water bond is an eight point eight billion dollar water but it'll cost about four thirty million dollars a year to pay back and this will be over the next forty years\nAre the biggest chunk of this money is two point five billion that will go to protect restore and improve quote watershed lands\nIn specific areas of the state what's a watershed Lynn a it's a pretty uh nebulous term a it's a place where there's a watershed mhm chair watershed is essentially an area where water drains through it\nUm in every area is divided into a watershed and so one could imagine that everything is a watershed\nUm but specifically some money set aside for watershed lands in the Sierra Nevada mountain range and one that would be interesting for San Diego and is there is a supposedly two hundred million dollars from this that will go to help or the salt and see which is a\nSort of water shady land out in imperial county I mean what's interesting about the solvency is that part of the reason that has become an issue part of the reason it's drying up part of the reason that dust um is fear to be going into the air sort of toxic mixture of dust there's some debate about how toxic\nIt is but that there's dust coming up from the sea as it dries up is that much of the water that used to be used in ... county for farming in the imperial valley is now coming to San Diego 'cause we are signed a deal I'm about Fifteen Years ago to get a lot of water from farmers out there to San Diego is one of the reasons it's drying up\nOur water supply is doing that and um this would go to sort of alleviate some of the concerns about the sea becoming a dangerous\nAnd um if that doesn't happen some farmers out there have threatened um to blow up this water deal and so this is an interesting way of having the state\nFund part of a problem that San Diego has at very least contributed to 'em there's also seven hundred and fifty million dollars in here for repairs to federally owned water projects and the Central Valley um the federal government in theory owns and should be a maintaining\nUm this water system but um this would direct state money to that of course these are California farmers so it ... you know maybe it doesn't matter if you think the federal government should be paying are not\nOn the supporters of this include John Cox and Dianne Feinstein what yeah so John Cox obviously the Republican for governor Diane Feinstein obviously the Democratic senator um they seem to both be interested in getting the votes of Central Valley farmers there it is yeah\nAnd the league of cities the chamber of commerce and ducks unlimited are also supporters\nThe ducks unlimited vote next time somebody asked me what the salt and see us I'm going to say obviously it's a sort of watershed yes yeah that's great\nI'm so opponents say that there are still a lot of unspent money from the twenty fourteen water bond I'm also they say that\nThe list of projects this would fund include some regional projects that typically are paid for by local water agencies so you know voters statewide would be paying for these\nAnd finally they say it doubles down on environmentally unfriendly projects um like big dams um and in fact a big environmental group is the leading opponent the Sierra Club of California\n[noise] alright ... for\nFor a fun change is another bond but force that kids\nThis one is for sick kids so this would authorize at one point five billion dollars in bonds to expand in renovate California's children's hospitals\nUm it would cost about eighty million dollars a year for thirty five years I'm now the money is broken up into sort of three chunks and by far the biggest chunk Seventy two per cent um would go to a group of eight nonprofit children's hospitals um that group does include rabies here in San Diego\nWell there you go um another Eighteen percent would go to a group of five you see hospitals\nHave weird point to mention on that in a second um and then the final ten percent would go to other public and private hospitals you know for a children's issues or programs\nUm hospitals naturally are big fans of this measure or radio alone has spent more than a million dollars supporting it uh the state did approve children's hospital bonds in two thousand and four and two thousand eight and eight\nAnd it still has about thirty billion in on issued bonds still from those measures so I Want to go back to the Eighteen percent chunk that goes to the five UC hospitals wise that interesting [laughter] so it sent me down this weird\nWormhole die roped Ryan to over the last couple of weeks\nBecause um the the ballot measure actually spells out what those five UC hospitals um that would get the money are and one of those hospitals is\nThe UC San Diego children's hospital now I've been living here for six years now I have a baby who was used at children's hospital and I never heard\nOf UC San Diego children's hospital and the reason I've never heard of UC San Diego children's hospitals\nBecause it does not exist and there's another hospital in this group I'm In Orange County that also does not exist Orange County assert by the children's hospital of Orange County which is one of those private entities that tend to different pot of money so you know Ryan", "show_name": "Voice of San Diego", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "15"}
