I should just do my friends to get an iPhone\nYeah yeah this is something Apple's done really really well I'm a [noise] I Wish every I don't know you know handwriting premise Android is not unlike Iowa not a unified ecosystem is lots of different Android phones and lots of different ways to do it [noise] so on the iPhone or a\nThis summer I was at amusement park and I are ... and my phone started ringing so when I when I got off I went and looked at it and it was a local call and I thought what made it as my hotel I better call it so I called and I get the police\nAnd they said we just had an emergency calls from this phone wow and I said oh my God no I just had it in my pocket\nYou know I must have done it I'm so sorry for the whole OJ [laughter] she goes are you on the intimidate or I Do yes I Am she goes oh good our GPS [laughter]\nThey knew exactly where you were\nAnd you know they probably are going down the hill it's scary\nEnough you could have had a heart attack on that thing I maybe they maybe [laughter] maybe they knew yeah they are yeah I\nBoy I'm you're exactly right tell everybody you know and everybody in your men's group that is a very especially as we get to a certain age that's a very important thing to have on there is you're in case of emergency information [noise]\nUh but unfortunately with Android phones there's no single way to do it as so Samsung phones do have a way and other phones if you at least in the lock screen put it in a large screen message or on the screen as a\nAs text\nWhy should it saves a lot\nMy pleasure I'm a look here's somebody saying [noise] ah I'm all look on my pixel phone which is kind of the default um Android phone to me saying that they also have an ice entry under contacts some of the search for I see you\nKnow all I'm getting is ice cream stores [laughter]\nThat's not going to help my heart health [laughter] yeah well it's really a great idea because we all know have phones are in our pockets all the time I'm In a it's a good thing just remember if you do put it on the screen message or edit the photo the locks and photo with the phone number\nThat anybody can see that I don't know I don't know if that's a bad thing or a good thing but that's the case [noise] our show they brought you by speaking of emergencies carbon I the there's a phone number you should keep icy in case of emergency carbonate as a single vendors solution to protect your data and business\nIt's all about the data it's all about the data and and making sure your data is protected is is really job one for your IT

carbon I'd dot com [noise] scooter accessing anger at nine has ... which is a Android Pie the latest emergency information section for access on the locks screen excellent excellent so that\nFewer than one percent of all Android phones are on Android nine however [laughter]\nOr if you are it's in there I guess I'll have to figure out where do they where do they keep that scooter ex he's in our chat room\nIs that are in contact it should be more obvious on and on the iPhone and I know most people have life on a more than half of\nSmartphone users in the u._s. or on my phone just go to the health application which is on all iPhones and you'll see in the health application there's a place that you can put emergency medical information they call it medical id fill that all out that's all you need to do with that little asterisk on the right at the bottom\nMedical id put in contact information blood\nYeah that's the that's the mind bending a district we're in right now or one of these mayors I got here this is I think from the campaign itself yeah paid for by ... this is a I'm a lifelong Democrat voting for ... because of vacation rentals\nOr again there's obviously since the Trump in very popular in the district\nHere's one in my hands right now uh that says when\nDonald Trump got elected Laurie is F had a party it is a decorated with a photo of lawyers F at sure enough a Trump inauguration party here in San Diego so yeah Donald Trump is featuring heavily into this campaign\nVery heavily this that when you just described as a mailer from the building trades group or the union mhm they're running under the moniker\nSan Diego against hate\nOr the building trades council the unions have they been hitting zap hard now for um these ten year old comments she made about ah about\nEight year old eight year old comments right ah oh no no no two thousand six email so yeah\nYeah so yeah two thousand six she she had some correspondence with a a famous or infamous local anti gay activist and um city I remember broke that story and it is now come back to hunter there's one a mailer here from the building trades council\nUp talking about all of the things she said about how she doesn't want I'm gay people to be allowed to teach stuff like that so that's hunting or\nYeah I mean it's interesting if only as a demonstration of of\nHow things change when the climate changes and you become vulnerable I mean this is the third time lawyers F as run for election in either district district or an overlapping district\nAnd these comments have never kept her from winning before right but the ideas that the climate is so polarized now or maybe not us or polarized now but the situation has changed so much now that this is now a real vulnerability for yet this district has um\nIt used to be I mean Kevin fault or want it as a Republican against Lorena Gonzalez yeah he got the firefighters endorsement over her that year and you know it's the point Loma Republicans sort of the yacht club Republicans\nWere were always a real strong force in it so it was never a given that it was like a a guaranteed democratic seat at All right and now it's like\nWow it's a very heavily democratic seats so for um the after when it's going to be you know but she's the incumbent that's the other force and Cummings never lose right\nRight and and she so you might have a ... if it was open last time you might have imagined a a Democrat having a good chance to win back in two thousand fourteen\nUm but she had this pseudo incumbency status and now she's still hasn't she has an actual incumbency status now and that's a big deal or at least it's traditionally been a big deal will say if it's still a big deal\nIt's just a district despite all these mailers and the national stuff factoring into it that seems to me so dominated by things that are really specific to that community so like airplane noise and speech drinking and vacation rentals\nAnd just things center yeah their own its like its own world\nI was just talking to somebody today who's ... heavily involved in the race and and they're like they're having trouble understanding why you know people aren't distinguishing between them too much and I'm like well on the major issues like that\nThey're almost perfectly in lockstep so the other of course rival is jet Dr Gen Campbell she's um this is her first race right for some run for office or she's a Democrat and now she won the second place in the run up in the in the primary in June\nAnd yeah so she is one of these fliers I found in the in the neighborhood\nOr has a ... talking about airport noise and how she opposes\nThe expansion of the airport terminal one which we've written about and then it has Gen Campbell thing here I agree with the expansion Gen Campbell God of course on the social media saying no no no I'm just as hostile to it as as a ... but again that's the the theme ride that on these local things\nThat the that the um if you do care about local policy that you're in that district probably going to be most attuned to they're almost lockstep but\nThere is some vast significant beyond that that those of us who follow city politics are well aware could really shake you know the future of the city up if it goes a red or\nBlue [laughter] yeah and we'll get into it but I I guess the the basic playing field here is that\nDemocrats have long had five four majority on the city council if this race where to flip they would have a six three veto proof majority meaning\nVirtually anything that the marriage did they'd be able to override if they so chose it would really change the power dynamics and potentially give Democrats an opportunity to run on their own progressive agenda um it's not clear what that progressive agenda would include they haven't\nYet made it a central part of their message here is you can see the message here is lawyers that said these things about gay people uh Laura's after the Republican just like Donald Trump um\nDoesn't mean that they don't have an agenda but it hasn't been part of the sales pitch\nAnd I got kind of a shock the yesterday when I got a poll from the building trades um council and the consultant running that effort and it was a poll said it was attracting pulled didn't have any positives and negatives about either cash just straight up which one do you support\nAnd it had a vast down ten points to the challenger Dr Gen Campbell and so it's like ooh wow\nWell I think you knew that there was that this was\nA potential real loss opportunity for the Republicans\nHave potential real pickup opportunities for the Democrats based on that the outcome of the ... a primary that Lourdes F was an incumbent ... has it was it was the only person who had that advantage on the ballot and she got less than fifty percent of the boat mhm so\nShe couldn't have won outright anyway\nBut you would have expected against the field of lesser known first time candidates except for a Brian Pease had run before but\nUh for mostly first time candidates with little name id you would've thought that she'd be able to get to fit over fifty and that the Democrats would have a tough time of\nPutting together a winning coalition it was surprising to see that in the primary if you just added up all the Democrats together they actually would have beat her yeah [noise] so local\nIssues have a way of transcending these sort of national identity a discussions about Republicans and Democrats that for instance is a bitter splits with some of her Republican colleagues over land use and vacation rentals\nAnd uh that came up and your interview when you're asked her about the midway community plan right what does that\nSo midway community plan is this a it's the area around sports arena\nAnd um basically the city has been in the process of updating the training plan for almost a decade it was passed earlier this year and um it added the capacity for quite a few more homes there by changing the zoning and I'm\nA lawyer Jeff basically said that she she kind of put the brakes on it it was in the home stretch it was coming through committee\nAnd she's sort of slammed on the brakes on it I'm trying to get some incremental additions to it which is very proud of a but she actually came under some criticism from Scott Sherman her fellow Republican city councilman who said you know let's be real here this would be sailing through if this were not an election year\nYeah so let's hear her describe what she did when she came across this plan\nSo when this you know initially came to the ... a couple of years or more ago\nI sat with the those planters I said it's really important to look at the traffic flow because this goes through mid way to um obeyed to point Loma traffic flow is going to be really critical so there were you know different iterations and so when the plant came to me right before\nA that committee um you know I got a briefing but then it really took a deeper dive into looking at him like oh my gosh there's nowhere near enough traffic medication and I cannot\nYou know with good conscience move forward or something where you build a lot of housing and it was like we need housing unit housing well yeah but you have to move\nAnd so then you asked her about that a beef she had with or Republican Cali\nYeah so you you mentioned getting hammered for it to your colleagues Scott Sherman set of the city council committee hearing when it got the lady said\nIf this wasn't an election year we wouldn't this which sale right through to you have any response ... yeah that's shocking\nAnd with friends like that [laughter] I mean seriously why didn't you just come and talk to me and I would have told you you know exactly what we've just been talking about right now but well that was a that was something\nThat was something again you know this is that that sort of phenomenon about local politics is is more local than even the city you know like you within the city there are going to be discussions where Republicans and Democrats have no sort of I'm signaling going on right\nInto ... earlier point I I think it's worth putting the finer points on that like in this district this is one of those issues land use development or increasing density it's a in a number of different ways has been a hot button there over the years", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Voice of San Diego", "city": "San Diego", "day": "29"}
