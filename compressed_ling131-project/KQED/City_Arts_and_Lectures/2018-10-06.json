program of the commonwealth of California I'm Gloria ... the president and CEOs the club\nA nonpartisan non profit public forum dedicated to earring diverse views on important topics of the day who would've thought to obtain have a nice day could be controversial [noise] get Harvard professors team\nHas been receiving a lot of resistance to his message that this is a nice day we're more specifically that it's the best time to be in line because of the wealth and well being around the globe along with the decline to learn more about the reasons for his often those you know it's just so much\nWe invited Dr ... to make his case he was in conversation with ... hari most of the wiring mind pod cast this program has generously supported by the Kennan Jackie broad family\nFine we would also like to thank United Airlines now please join Steven Pinker hurry hurry for the commonwealth club conversation [noise]\n\nGood evening everyone and welcome to tonight's program at the commonwealth club [noise] my name's to shore hari and I'm pleased to be your moderator for tonight's program joining us this evening is the one and only Steven Pinker Johnstone family professor of psychology at Harvard University and author of the best selling book enlightenment now\nA doctor pickers and experimental cognitive psychologist in enlightenment now explores the progress that humanity has made through enlightenment thinking while today's world can be characterized by hyper polarization disintegrating discourse and the degradation of fact he argues that the world is actually improving\nSo please join me now and walking Dr Steven Pinker [noise]\nAll right Steve I made the mistake of opening Twitter before I came out here and now I don't feel like the world isn't a good place [noise]\nWhich I think a key feature of the of that ad you spend a lot of time arguing the reverse that this is one of this might be the greatest time to be alive how so\nPeople are living longer and what's more fundamental from life people are a wealthier I got I don't mean the one percent but I mean the bottom ten percent that rates of extreme poverty have been plunging by\nThree quarters and just the last three decades rates of literacy has\nIncreased about Ninety percent of the world's population under the age of twenty five can read and write\nRates of death in from all forms of violence are in decline there are fewer people were killed in war in\nThis decade decade and nineties the seventies sixties fifties to say nothing of the world's worst rates of violent crime has been declining including violence against women or so in most measures of human well being\nYou see improvements over a span of decades and centuries\nIf I knew it wasn't a mistake and you sound like a hyper optimist to me actually is that the point of this book you\nThe point actually is not optimism that all the point is I knowing the fact that it's not a question of well if if global poverty has fallen to um ten percent should we concentrate she would be happy about Ninety percent or upset about the ten percent factors we should note that the numbers are Ninety percent in ten percent most people don't do that\nPercent and ten percent most people don't know that most people when asked\nHow is poverty across the world extreme poverty increasing or decreasing a majority said increasing or staying the same the correct answers that it's decreasing\nThe question of optimism those are questions just knowing facts likewise\nIs the rate of death in warfare higher or lower now than it was saying the Nineteen eighties now it's not a question of being optimistic that there are fewer wars are pessimistic but there's still an awful wars in Syria and Yemen and elsewhere\nIt's question just knowing which way the world is is going what\nThe late Swedish doctrine ... recalls fact fullness\nFullness I like knowing what the facts are now now should we be on my wife is going to call me full of facts later [laughter] I don't know how I feel about it why\nA return to be enlightenment of all the periods of human history to have that kind of crawl back towards whiny light minutes been two hundred plus years since\nYou know it's it's not it's not it's not a return is not calling back it's not you know may bring bring back their late minute it's a question of affirming [noise] a a set of ideals that were most articulate plea stated a during their light meant but that are still relevant namely reason science and humanism\nLet's start to unpack those ideals but first to a minor history lesson what made those ideas emerge at that time\nSo we we it's it's a hard question to answer because it only happened once and so without any historical event we can't replace the things the tape a number of times and and the number of ways at times when different directions depending on what meat have we proceeded it but\nA plausibly the rise of print and literacy that if you were to look at something that happened before the say the second half of the Eighteenth century it's that's when you want to more or less central to the uh the the light and\nUm it was an era in which the population of European countries surpassed fifty percent literacy for the first time in history\nIt was a time at which the cost of putting a book or a pamphlet\nPlummeted us those greater mobility of people and ideas it made the historical memory of the wars of religion of the um sixteenth century sixteenth and seventeenth century\nThat people realized that killing people by the tens of millions depending on their interpretation of holy trinity probably isn't the best way to run\nA society in part it was the fruits of the scientific revolution which showed that a lot of angels human beliefs were were were\nOutright false of which birther the faith belief that the son\nWrote revolves around the earth is maybe the most famous example than perhaps the the result of ah the age of exploration that they were all of his continents that\nIt's teeming with life with people's with ... different cultures that\nPeople didn't even know existed until a century before ... expand and people psoriasis so all of these things we don't really know what was the cause but\nBut they all seem to come together\nAnd I want to unpack some of these ideas now so when you say reason I think that means something different nowadays than what you want you unpack in the book we what do you mean by reading\nRationality logic uh LA it does I hadn't good yeah rationality logic as opposed to\nAs opposed to dogma as opposed to parsing scriptures as opposed to authority as opposed to conventional wisdom\nAs opposed to bad feelings that the feeling of subjective certainty and after the glow of of a feeling that you're in the right because you're you and your your um this Internet infallible or that someone else who you admire sense that they are under center infallible superstitions\nA dog my fair a so those are all alternatives to reason and science I I think the science the application\nOf reason to the the natural world so not all of reason to science because there's also logic is also mathematics there's also a moral arguments but when you apply reason to the way the ... the way things are work that we call it science\nAnd then the the one that I I think most people haven't haven't heard of or at least I'm package is humanism yeah\nSo humanism is just the idea that the ultimate moral good is to promote human well being that is the the ... the happiness the longevity the knowledge the experience of\nOur men women and children and other animals but we'll we'll we'll begin with humans as opposed to now you could say well who could be opposed to that I mean who could be against people living longer and ... are being healthier and and uh\nHaving enough to each well there are alternative moral system such as that the ultimate good is to carry out God's commandments or to maximize the glory of the nation or the race or creed so even though it may seem to be completely unacceptable that you do what makes the most people better off\nI was actually in a way it's kind of a radical idea\nI was actually it's a prize to the morality have such a place in this book in that way because I ascribe to reason and science not I don't ascribe that word moral much ... why do you think that it's such an important component here\nWell the uh we all are um guided by ah by our own sense of morality of ... a lot of our arguments involving what we should do in fact anytime we use the word where it's like short or art or we are making a moral judgments\nSo we all need some kind of moral system that we rely on either explicitly or implicit\nBut they are ideas and the west\nBy no means a ever a shooter these ideas to the debate that's gone within the west\nSo did you write this book in response to that rise of a Trump ism as you put it this tribalism that was emerging\n[noise] no I although not at the outset although I did have to incorporate that ah the ... I began to book in two thousand Fifteen I signed a contract for the book in two thousand Thirteen\nAnd so the idea that Donald Trump would be president with a ... came out of The Simpsons because if I literally I mean it was it was absurd at the time\nThe Simpsons has proven to be quite pressure you well you have [laughter]\nSo it did require and this was a pretty uh pretty conspicuous elephant in the room that I could not ignore and a book on progressing so I deal with the uh it forced me to confront the fact that the that the west right up to the president has not been synonymous with enlightenment ... so what\nWere you seeing around twenty Thirteen twenty Fifteen Hi Mose yeah it did inspire either\nSo we were in a in a sense lightening now was something of a sequel to the better angels of our nature the book that I published in two thousand eleven which was inspired by my\nComing across many data sets showing that rates of violence had been and historical declined\nA ... you can't come to from reading the news because news covers violence wherever it occurs does not cover tend to cover non violence you don't see a reporter saying I'm reporting a\nLive from school it's not been shut up\nOr a country that's a piece\nYou don't see a headline saying a Southeast Asia has had a war for Thirty years but\nLet's go streets clean [laughter]\nThirty years say let's go streets clean things on the on the news yeah so\nWhen you when you portray for violence or time ... that's when you see a decline because a rate of violence number of people killed per hundred thousand per year\nIncludes both the people who are killed in the new murder and the people who aren't killed that go into the drama Nader and that's when you can appreciate\nSomething otherwise could elude architecture so the better angels of our nature was on a six historical declines of violence and when I completed a book then I realized that they were actually we went to take that mindset\nSuffering the world by quantitative measures overtime not over reports of things that go wrong because things will always go wrong there the ... the world will never be perfect or be dangerous to try to make it perfect\nAnd you just simply can't have any idea as to whether things are improving or not unless you look at data well if you look at data if you expand the data look at from violence to other measures of human well being such as\nNutrition such as infectious disease such as leisure time such as a democracy such as longevity such as literacy all of those are going in a positive direction too and no one seemed to know about it\nSo we're a cognitive psychologist why do I feel those trends then because when I Know about this I I can look at the data and say oh yeah human lifespan is increasing and has been\nFor a long period of time now you know we've flattened out in the last couple of years here in the U.S but by and large it's been going up I don't feel that way I feel the the oncoming approach of\nOf obesity and uh uh the rise and type two diabetes et cetera am I not just predisposed to good news\nThere well there is um [noise] there's I think there's some systematic reasons why we're our our understanding of the world is disconnected from from a reality one of them is a feature of human psychology called the exam ability she respects that's a term from Amos for skiing Daniel Kohn um in\nFact we often assess probability risk danger by how easily examples come to mind how vivid images how striking a narrative since what the news does this report things that happen not things that don't happen and the things that happen are more likely to be\nNegative and positive you don't have a headline that hundred and thirty seven thousand people escape from extreme poverty yesterday although\nThe papers could have run that headline every day for the last Thirty years and says max ... pointed out\nOr if you combined the nature of news which is to report things that go wrong with nature of cognition which has to be um\nBy the end of the images and narratives and stories were not as news gathering becomes more efficient we're guaranteed to almost to think that things are getting worse even if as I'm getting better that's one reason\nAnd putting on my science and said oh are we evolved in ... in our evolutionary history is that a a situation that we're we're naturally predisposed to because our brains aren't moving at the ... at the speed of a news if you will enter yes it is it's development\nYeah I think that's right that the uh data sets really didn't exist until quite recently where we're naturally and numerous they uh arithmetic mathematics are recent inventions in human history as a existed for a fraction of the time we've been when not human it's not\nCatastrophic the fact that our mind goes with\nThe examples of anecdotes because after all those are are not only available before the existence of literacy and data gathering organizations but they do reflect local conditions or\nAs I Am not a bad first approximation it really is true that there are more pigeons city than than non white breasted nuthatches and you know that without having to do a bird census you don't have to look a day that he was just consult your your image is not the case where your images are are are correct and they often are correct\nBut not when it comes to a world of seven billion people\nYeah and so this is the one of the things that struck me as if that doesn't come naturally to us this idea of of thinking in the world in these hyper rational ways through the lens of data because we are human we are predisposed to our evolutionary roots\nAren't you asking us to take a little bit of a leap of faith\nWell to to think this way\nNo it's not a leap of faith it's a week ... sweep of education it's the opposite of a leap of faith\nAnd that is we [noise]\n\nIt it certainly does require a inhibiting certain impulses and instincts not calling with our our our gut feelings to uh to allow our best days are best reason art and the fruits of our educational system to override our intuitions\nI just think back to um I Can't remember exactly when but George W. Bush talking about leading from his good and um how a tractor but that was\nTo see a leader talking about it that way you describe like the leaders that we should really be attracted to are the ones that speak to reason and science because they're going to be grounded in progress is is that a fair assessment of of your of your point\nYes we'll be the that up the policy should be based on rational analysis for sure I Know of course a politician in a democracy in order to be elected has to appeal to people with all of their biases and emotions and intuitions are skilled politician\nA and an admirable politician would be one who combines the most rational analysis of policy with the greatest skill\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts

that's probably been the best we can hope for leadership in a democracy\nOr the best we can hope for a feel like that is resident right now um [noise]\nWhy go back\nTwo hundred years that timeline seems arbitrary and some point I understand you're going back to the enlightenment but why not fifty years ago or\nOr more realistically for us the even the last ten to twenty because I tend not to give you my life in the context of wow in Seventeen Fifteen they weren't doing as well or as I Am now I tend to think about like how I was doing a year ago maybe even ten years ago\nWell the thing is that these these trends are\nVisible not just over centuries but over decades and over the years I mean not all of them there's always like oh that can be reversals that can be sickening lectures but going back to sake stream poverty or as I mentioned that is a hundred and thirty seven thousand people a day for the last Thirty years I was a skeptic extreme poverty\nUm when it comes to war and democracy just in my own lifetime I mean I I when I was a college student world had thirty one democracies today has a hundred and three were wars to kill people at a rate of from nine per hundred thousand per year now the rate is about one point for private thousand per year\nSo these aren't centuries I mean I'm I'm not that old but this is a [laughter]\nOh this was biography autobiography now so ah again not everything\nIt it would be it would be inconceivable that every thing when you measure over history goes down a\nMonitor honestly I thought reasonable to expect that but still even when there are reversals wrinkles you do see overall a lot of these trends not all of them but a lot of them to extend opening the reach of decades years [noise]\nThis is the commonwealth fund of California radio program you can learn more about the commonwealth fund its\nMany programs and how to become part of the\nThis may be a reflection of another a psychological featured the summit called the negativity but\nUs that bad ways\nI'm a more heavily than good we are we drive losses more than we look forward to gains a criticism stings more than praise a booms ah we\nAh remember recent bad events that have been recent good events and so that may open up a nice for people to remind us some bad things that we may have overlooked and so we do a\nA scribe greater moral seriousness to to pass them is\nThat the biblical profits are are a good example we consider them both\nMoral and they warned us imminent do it's easy it's it's kind of cheap and easy to be a pessimist 'cause they'll always be things that go wrong and you can if you assemble a list of all the worst things that are happening anywhere on the planet any given time it's always going to look pretty depressing [noise]\nNow of course something ... tons of things do get worse is not this is not an argument for optimism in the sense that we should always believe things get better things don't always get better and then there's no reason to believe that they will left to their own devices [noise]\nIt's a rather that we should have the most accurate assessment that we can half of the state of the world and the direction that it's going to try to identify what it is that makes things better and do more of them\nThat I'm being a style jak but I ... in my house I grew up and we would watch the news every night and it wasn't good news back then we'd watch Peter Jennings on ABC\nAnd there is always bad news they left one segment at the end that was sort of the good news but it does feel like there is a prevailing sense when I turn on the news now that it feels more pessimistic than ever yeah why are we seeing a trend line in that around and with the coverage of the narratives that we see out\nThere there is a good question and it and it um you know I had to be careful not to say my phone to my own trap and saying well the ferry the other news is getting worse I wouldn't have to get more pessimistic without any data and so I did find data there is a a data scientist named ...\nWho did a a random algorithm that tallied up the number of positive or negative words news stories in the New York times and in a sample of global new services since the Nineteen forties\nAnd found that in fact it has gotten more more pessimistic for justice people are living longer and there's and and I received death and war been going down and race if literacy even going down the news has been getting more and more morose and so this is a factor ... ...\nWho's leading the horse there is that reflective of something that we writ large as the public is inspiring the media to rest either that or is it the reverse\nThat's a good question if it was just the negativity biased and human nature that would protect that there should be a trend toward greater pessimism cause human nature I haven't changed in the last Seventy years\nI it may be a combination of our greater ability to gather news that we can send a well represented news crews new news teams to the remote corners of the world now everyone with a smartphone as I can can beam\nVideo footage to the to the Web instantaneously it's partly paradoxically the I'm kind of a gift of are expanding circle of empathy that we care more about\nPeople and not just people other organisms and parts of the world that may have fallen ... police our radar in the past so we care more about\nFamines and Africa\nAnd wars in in in Yemen that our ancestors may happen\nLittle kids being bullied and um and women being sexually harassed which used to happen but just wasn't an issue now it is an issue um and and the third\nPossible answer your question is that there is a change I think in the culture of journalism where it's considered increasingly ah especially since the seventies I think that the\nUh mores of of of responsible journalism all were as increasingly been to point out what's going wrong to speak truth to power to to break the mock\nA and that they were saying they're saying revulsion I think in the courtroom journalism to the old style of uh being complicit with um power structures not to show Roosevelt from the waist down because it would he would look as presidential\nTo overlook JFK's affairs to kind of be cheerleaders for the government now it's the other way around\nPerhaps even gone to an extreme where I\nEvery civic institution is considered to be a target for an aggressive take down and there's a kind of cynicism that nothing can ever work everything is corrupt which may have had pernicious consequences\nBut there has been some criticism of your book a year not that isn't new to you I'm In one of the criticisms came from from the right especially the religious right who saw this as a rebuke of the role of faith in society a and I'm curious what your thoughts were\nUh yeah I don't think that things have civil society I mean there's not just faith in the sense of bleeding something without a reason now this doesn't mean that there is no role for religious institutions in society and religious institution\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of

of religious institutions going forward than like what opportunities to UC for them it in a world that is is driven by a latent ideal\nWorld religions have a um a rich historical legacy they they are

All right um so these are not ignoramus says these are not skinheads um these are\nSome cases extremely intelligent articulate ah people but they have often been repelled by the uh\nAtmosphere of um of of um\nPolitically correct dogma on American campuses uh and and in in certain American media and often when they come across politically incorrect I'm a facts they feel that the entire establishment has been systematically repressing um [noise] a\nSet of facts and feel emboldened that the exact opposite of the establishment must have\nA greater be much more in tune to the tune in to the truth\nAnd therefore often embrace a extreme an unjustified interpretations of certain facts that simply can't be discussed\nAnd therefore we're never inoculated to them ... against the most extreme interpretation sounds I wouldn't be concrete um the idea that that men and women are indistinguishable at our except for social isolation that the babies are born a identical\nNow I think there's a lot of evidence that that that's not true that there are differences between men and women\nIs that as an unmentionable\nThan the first time you hear it I mean when you start to either look around you or become privy to findings from science that showed at that\nThat the sexes aren't indistinguishable then you can start to wonder well gee well maybe this whole idea of feminism was a mistake and we should go back to to traditional roles and that's a non factor because the ideals of stamina some are moral and political ideals that people ought to be treated as individuals", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "06"}
