crunch to than raise the steaming glass to his lips there was a sign of Leah and by the time the rabbi escorted me out I was in despair pushing my way for the garden and it seems to have grown denser since I came I felt something at least about brushing my neck and I turned\nThere was Leah in a window watching me from the curtains son was high on the skies reflection flashed on the glass\nThe truth was all I saw clearly was blue hair and clowns and the white gem of light with only the fainted silhouette of a girl behind a pale oval says shamed by stirring lace\nStill I reach into my pocket and slipped out the pages Keats had carefully cut out for her oh two nights ago and had folded again and again into a tiny bundle\nI waved blindly I'm hoping she was watching me\nAnd the rabbi wasn't I dropped it in the tall glass\nWhat are you aiming for he asked oh nothing I just saw him he laughed again go lie down you're dreaming leaves at the market\nBut I couldn't rest\nI rolled around on my mattress until the damn sheets were strangling me I went to the sink and slashed water on my head I watched mobs bounce against my screens\nAfter two nights like this I decided to soccer [noise]\nI knew I was acting crazy but I didn't care had to get this out out of my head\nA crouched behind a parked car up the block where I had a clear view of their house\nAfter an hour the car's owner appeared and I had to pretend that I was looking for a lost necklace I'm sure it was here and they told the guy and the Lakers jacket and kept my legs were asleep and I stumbled around head bowed lower strip of glass or the\nCurve you didn't see it has some and then a little Sharm shaped like a dog it was my mother's\nSorry you said\nGood luck when he drove off I saw Leah standing on the sidewalk by her house and staring at me she turned abruptly and headed down the block wait I called and went after her but my legs were still numb and she moved surprisingly fast considering her jerky off center sway\nShe was appalled of course to see me hobbling behind her\nBut I caught it by the corner where she had to stop for the light\nLeo way please what she demanded catching her breath\nWhat are you following me for it shop is tonight has got to get to the bakery it's frightening completely forgotten could have waited to see her at the school I had the shower and get ready myself\nWhat time is it now might watch stock\nWithin his aspiration and checking both ways on the button on her blouse she reached in and pulled out too folded pages sprinkles and press flat like flowers in the book\nFolded pages sprinkles and press flat like flowers in the book here she said\nShe these she pushed them into my hand to cheat so it's\nStill warm\nYou found this I asked how did you know I left it for you should clear to me\nWhat do you mean it was sitting on my front step when I got home thank God father didn't find it first\nBut how did you know you see me today I didn't ... how did you know they're bringing them now she lost\nHer throat turned crimson and the blood rose quickly to her cheeks\nI didn't\nI was afraid to leave them anywhere in case my father saw not just please leave me alone my God if you saw us\nNo wait you\nDon't understand if you knew the truth about me I Know enough\nShe said and turned to go I wanted to grab her hand but restrain myself I wanted to shout I'm a\nJew I wouldn't you know\nBut now that seems even worse I denied my people and desecrated the Sabbath just to make it a little cash\nI watched her race away from me her dark hair coming undone or hips rising and falling\nLead it and come to school at night the rabbi arrived alone and says she was sick with the flu fever and a headache I guess it's going around he said or were you feeling better fine\nI blurted skillfully but I felt like I was dying I hoped I was anyway I sat through the service and actually paid attention for the first time\nKeeping my eyes on the rabbi him off the balcony it helped a little sound those words I couldn't understand relaxed me the prayers like songs\nBeautifully meaningless\nLeah wasn't there the next day either and when I got out of synagogue I went straight to the saloon there was a lot of people waiting but when she saw me Olga squeeze me am darling you look awful she said eating me into the chair and resting my head on the sink you need a
