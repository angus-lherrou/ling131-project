I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and that\nIs the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusions do pay attention to euro Randy is now in her late thirties a few years ago her life unraveling at a time she ran the dining services department at a senior living facility she'd been with a company that ran it for more than a decade one day\nShe made a mistake how has just been a rash [noise] to get home that was on the parents daycare clouds of the things I get asked that size and it's like maybe\nTen mile drive busy traffic area and and I knew I had to pick up diapers and the easiest thing for me at that would be to pick 'em up beside the baby yet\nSo Brandi stopped at a store ran in and grab the diapers she's flight took credit card at the self checkout station and race down it turns out she used the wrong card not around by the company credit coming\nThat was crazy is I didn't realize at that moment I didn't realize it sounded a supervisor climbing in and said hey let's as packages had she not said anything I don't think I Would have realized that\nRandy carried the card in case you needed to buy dining supplies or what she never had a problem before never been reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do in response was well you\nKnow we have to determine nature and I'm like no I didn't know that and I can I just pay you back it was only like twelve month [noise] and she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate them play\nAnd this crime and crime and like a day because I tend to believe that\nI didn't want to go on the town I Can't let it happen that didn't want to tell my has now let an app and I just didn't know what to do at that point I found like as ... as a parent because I didn't provide ... at that example\nEven listen mistake brandy on more than her husband so the last of the job hit hard she sounds like a new show she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like looking takeoff meals but the stretch group Randy and her husband began fighting\nShe had supported him when he been laid off a few years earlier and she'd expected he'd do the same for her but he found his situation was different he'd been laid off brandy was fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake\nThat final argument lists that I'm less out the house that morning I was going to chat interviews at two interviews that day and I didn't practice toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet paper\nWhen I came in with the kids he just immediate started yelling you can't keep yourself together you can't\nSomeone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the eternity bill or gas money or credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if you buy two carriers will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rescue could homework do other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do many people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result\nIs they try too hard to be like in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't\nPay attention to what's actually being set the conversation falter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward or flat for what happens is the result people in our voice the composition of list and the only person becomes even lonely [noise]\nThis lands offers a new way of thinking about white people who\nFind themselves in scarcity seemed to do things that to an outsider look stupid\nWhen you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper\nSanders says we're asking the wrong question what if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty\nMake everyone less capable than it's the\nPoverty make everyone less capable that it's the it's it's you\nAnd I tomorrow will be to become poor or with all of a sudden have this seems like the poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some leading theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and out in ... wanted to test that hypothesis\nThe oldest is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugar cane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after her this well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who would rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example the farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who were poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short term thinking to be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about\nIt's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like you did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity you have experience\nOn Sundays we get to leave that for pm someday if we don't leave till one AM [laughter] and then\nYou start the next day and night thirty or six in the morning usually work eighty hours a week\nWhat did you come back we'll find out how being overworked and exhausted can produce its own form of scarcity\nI'm Shankar Vedantam [noise] and you're listening to hidden brain from NPR\nNews I'm\nSupport for Kate Q.

I might go walking for half an hour and then I had read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to\nTry to get in more exercise than like I never know and I'll get enough exercise

just a mess and um I my clothes piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes\nAnd coming home to salt so overwhelming I didn't want to be there and that's part of\nI think when I was walking so much just to

about the lives of the liver wealthy this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] Brooke discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers none aloft about the private lives of that lying and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\nReal Cancun welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just a client's\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples of the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate and increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing it to me um maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nThere can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets preferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some way to get to know that clients better than the appliance own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that the average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children but\nThey're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nI understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm trying to be a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of person becomes in a while\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Shepherd ...\nAre very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seem to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack them around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients wants calls from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story\nSo this is one of the first stories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager\nEleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom a client who lives in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it\nAnd the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter] so imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did she she determined where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case down the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay ...\nThere are some times ah clients do make request like this not because the are acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed the desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David staying get me the salmon and David said on on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients west\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up\nThat story it I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I Want it and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I\nGot from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages in a way what children just like you know everybody else ... but ... you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or parents will ask the wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes to the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family the big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues\nDart lawsuit
