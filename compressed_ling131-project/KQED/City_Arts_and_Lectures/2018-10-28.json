Perennial\nNight veil falls across many genre lines comedy science fiction magical realism slice of life Americana and definitely horror up next a short story from one of the greats of horror fiction beautiful stranger I surely Jackson [noise]\nRead about [noise]\nWhat might be called the first intimation of strangeness occurred up the railroad station\nShe had come with her children small drawn and her baby girl to meet her husband when he returned from a business trip to Boston because she had been oddly afraid of being late\nAnd perhaps even seeming on eager to encounter her husband after a week's separation she dressed the children and put them into the car at home along half hour before the train was do\nAs a result of course they had to wait intermittently up the station\nAnd what was to have been a charming league staged a reunion family embracing husband and father became it last and ill timed and awkward performance\nSmall John's hair was most and he was sticky the baby was cross pulling at her pink bonded and her dainty lace edged dress whining\nThe final arrival of the train caught them in mid movement as it were Margaret was tying the ribbons on the baby's bonnet small John was half over the back of the car seat stay scrambled out of the car cringing from the sound of the train hopelessly out of sorts\nJones senior waved from the ... steps of the train\nUnlike his wife and children he looked utterly prepared for his return as though he had taken some pains to secure a meeting at last painless\nAnd had in fact stood just so waving core Julie from the steps of the train for perhaps as long as half an hour to ensuring that he should not be caught how Freddie his hand not lifted so far as to over emphasize the extent of his delight\nIn seeing them again\nHis wife had an odd sense of last time\nStanding now on the platform with the baby in her arms and small John beside her she could not for a minute remember clearly whether he was coming home or whether they were yet standing here to say goodbye to him\nThey had been correlating when he left and she had spent the week of his absence determining to forget\nThat in his presence she had been frightened and hurt this will be a good time to get things straight she had been telling herself\nWhile John is gone I can try to get hold of myself again now on shore at last whether this\nAgain now on shore at last whether this was an a rival or a departure she felt afraid again straining to me to an ... in ... attention this\nShe'd like to look at him his hair she thought was a little darker than John's enters hands were stronger this man would build whatever he decided he wanted built\nWe need things together things we like both of us\nSmall delicate pretty things um I agree with John ... she would have felt it necessary to remark at once that they could not afford such a delicate pretty things and put a cold finish to the idea but with a stranger she said we'd have to look for them\nNot everything would be right I saw a little creature once he said like a little tiny man\nOnly colored old purple and blue\nAnd gold\nShe remembered this conversation it contained the truth like a jewel set in the evening\nMuch later she wants to tell herself that it was true John could not have said these things she was happy she was radiant she had no conscience\nSki went to be the lead to his office the next morning saying goodbye at the door with a room full smile that seemed to mock the president the subsidy for doing the things that John always did\nAnd as she walked him go down the walk she reflected that this will surely not going to be permanent she could not indoor having him go on for so long every day although she had felt a little about\nFrom John moreover if he kept doing John's things he might grow imperceptibly more light\nSponsorship that the cake you read the live stream my sanity from Comcast with extended day customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X steady on demand\nSeeing him get into the car she would gladly share with him indeed gave him out right all that had been John's so long as he stayed her stranger\nShe laughed while she did her housework and dress the baby she took satisfaction in on packing his suitcase which he had abandoned and forgotten in a corner of the bedroom had prepared to take it up and leave again if she had not been as he thought her had not wanted him to stay\nShe put away his clothes so disarming Li like Johns and wondered for a minute of the closet\nWould there be a kind of a delicacy in him about John's things then she told herself no\nNot so long as he had been with John's wife and she left again the baby was cross all day but when small John came home from nursery school his first question was looking up eagerly whereas daddy daddy has gone to the office\nAnd again she left at the moments quick sly picture of the insult to John\nHalf a dozen times during the day she went upstairs to look at his suitcase\nAnd touched the leather softly she glanced constantly as she passed through the dining room into the corner where the small shelves would be some day\nAnd told her stuff that they would find a tiny little man all purple and blue and gold to stand on the shelves and guard them from intrusion\n[noise] when the children to wake him from their naps she took them for a walk and then away from the house and returned violently to her former lonely pattern walk the children talk meaning Leslie of daddy long for someone to talk to in the evening ahead\nRestrain herself from hurrying home\nHe might have telephoned she began to feel frightened again suppose she had been wrong\nIt could not be possible that she was mistaken it would be on a true bleed cruel for John to come home\nTonight [noise] then she heard the car stop and when she opened the door and looked up she thought now it is not my husband with the return of blackness\nShe was aware from his smile that he had perceived her doubts and yet he was so clearly a stranger that seeing him she had no need\nOf speaking\nShe asked him instead almost meaningless questions during that evening and just answers were important only because she was storing them away to reassure herself while he was a way\nShe asked him what was the name of their Shakespeare professor in college and who was that girl he likes so before he met Margaret\nWhen he smiled and said that he had no idea that he would not recognize the name if she told him she was in delight he had not bother to master all of the past that and he had learned enough and the names of the children the location of the house\nHow she liked her ... tales to get to her and after that it was not important because either she would want him to stay or she would calling upon John send him away again\nWhat is your favorite food she asked him are you on to fishing did you ever have a\nDog someone told me today he said once\nThat he had heard that I was back from Boston and I distinctly thought he said that he heard that I was\nDead in Boston ... he was lonely too she thought was sadness\nAnd this is why he came bringing a destiny with him now I Will see him come every evening through the door and think this is not my husband and wait for him remembering that I Am waiting for a stranger\nAt any rate she said you are not dead in Boston and nothing else matters\nShe saw him leave in the morning with a warm pride and she did her housework and dress the baby when small John came home from nursery school he did not ask but looked with quick searching eyes and inside\nWhile the children were taking their naps\nShe thought that she might take them to the park this afternoon and then the thought of another such afternoon another long afternoon with no one but the children another afternoon of window hood was more than she could submit to\nI have done this too much she thought I must have seen some thing today beyond the faces of my children no one should be so much alone moving quickly she dressed and set the house to rights\nShe called the high school girl and asked if she would take the children to the park\nWithout guilt she neglected the thousands small orders regarding the proper jacket for the baby whether small John might have popcorn when to bring them home she fled thinking I must be with people\nThinking I must be with people she took a taxi into town because it seemed to her that the only possible thing to do was seek out a gift for him or her first gift for him\nAnd she thought she would find him perhaps a little creature old blue and purple and gold\nShe wandered through the strange shops in the town choosing small lovely things to stand on the new shelves\nLooking long and critically at ... at small statues at brightly colored meaningless expensive toys suitable for\nGiving to a stranger it was almost dark when she started home carrying her packages she looked from the window of the taxi into the dark streets\nAnd fought with pleasure up a stranger would be home before her and look from the window to see her hurrying to him he would think this is a stranger I Am waiting for a stranger as he saw her coming\nHere she said tapping on the glass right here driver she got out of the taxi and pay the driver\nAnd smiled as he drove away I must look well she fought the driver smiled back at me\nShe turned and started for the house and then hesitated surely she had come too far this is not possible she fought this\nCannot be surely our house was white\n\nThe evening was very dark\nAnd she could see only the house is going in rows with more rose beyond them and more rose beyond that and somewhere a house which was worse with the beautiful stranger inside\nI never said a word of what happens not to anyone I was willing to be colorblind if it would keep her perfect\nI told you she got pregnant just when he was about to ask her for the divorce I shake the next coat and to cafeteria tickets part of the pocket one for spaghetti with meat balls and one for a cream soda I bet she did it on purpose part of an evil scheme\nShe isn't looking at me but she doesn't seem to be writing in the register anymore either she's usually such a perfectionist but she can get pretty sloppy if she's thinking about her doctor when I asked him if he'd even told her he got defensive and came up with all these excuses\n[laughter] they're worried about the boy getting into the right elementary school his wife could go into premature labor she's got some experiment running at the lab they can't be distracted the train got stuck in the snow\nLoad of crap she stopped for a moment and I read the label on the next coat she writes it down in the register I think the coasts or in a pretty sorry state all wrinkled and stained blood spit urine tears\nYou can tell by the color and the smell it's amazing all the stuff that can use out of a\nBody one lie leads to another I say she should know\nHe finally showed up past ten last night dog tired from being stuck on the train for five hours he said but I was the one who was tired tired of waiting\nAll that time of running to the door at every little noise watching the dinner I'd made get\nCold she runs her hand through our hair and looks down again her skin is so white her shoulders really beautiful the pen rolls across the desk do you know what he told me\nHe said he had a lot of time to think on the train that he felt like some invisible force was holding him back that it wasn't the right time and that was why it had snowed he said he wanted me to be patient to wait just a little longer just a little longer\nAnd then we screwed just like we always do that's all we have left\nI imagine her naked the doctors fingers running over her skin her hair the wet places I picture her tongue licking the edge of the blue envelope who wouldn't want her\nGastrointestinal med too long up them all a G one short neurology one long pediatrics for short to pick up the pace trying to distract her but she's not paying attention anymore depends still on the desk\nHow could he be so cruel how could you tell me to wait no I couldn't wait any longer not one more day not one more second\nI take the register and begin checking the coats myself trying to be as needed she is\nThat's why I killed him she says her voice is low and cold I feel\nA scream rising out of me but somehow I stop it hold it back\nAnd instead I calmly imagine the scene the knife and her pretty hand the blades slicing into him again and again skin ripping blood spurting but she's\n[noise] I pick up the next coat respiratory medicine one long it's his I shake it at out falls a tongue it's still soft\nMaybe even warm\n[noise]\nMore in Ireland performed
