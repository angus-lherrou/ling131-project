the morning and temperatures tomorrow in the seventies and eighties\nCake Huey di San Francisco Kaye kiwi I north highlands Sacramento it's eight o'clock\n[laughter]\nWelcome to world affairs weekly broadcast of the world affairs counsel I'm Jane whales the EL this is the third and a three part series focused on climate change that has consequences it's also about the reasons we have for hope I admit I Am among those who sometimes despair of\nOur inability to muster the political will to address climate change but there are hopeful signs and our guest former vice president Al Gore will speak to some of them he\nArgues that we're now in the early stages of sustainability revolution can present his point of view and a conversation with a condom is large Tyson professor at UC Berkeley there that was recorded Colin I spotlight on climate solutions symposium in San Francisco\nIt was sponsored by the Asia Society stay tuned for the second half of our program\nWhen we'll hear from two grassroots leaders and the fight to address climate change the broadcasters made possible each week by the general support as the M wear and tear Draper reaches caplin foundation\nI Want to start with I caught a few hours which I particularly like\nWhere are they stay in the middle of the revolution\nHad had on the industrial revolution is that how transformative\nAdded at the state of the digital every job so [laughter] very optimistic statement and\nAnd they weren't on and on about what's happening and I want to start with what are the main reasons to\nOn what the trend is one of the things that you look at it and now\nAnd to stand on\nYeah well first anybody who deals with the climate crisis on so many of you here have been dealing with it for quite a while [noise]\nUh but any of us who get involved occasionally have a struggle between open openly are but I always do come down on the side of hope and I think the evidence justifying that oath is overwhelming mail\nThe sustainability revolution magnitude of industrial speed of a digital\nIs based on a many of the new digital tools that are now available\nWith machine learning an artificial intelligence the Internet of things so\nFor ... a machining a computational saw on the digital side as in many different varieties I'll give you one quick example from the bay area [noise]\nUm [noise] two guys from low one on Democrats sort of a sudden must office away money to started dating law which many including many regard as the best artificial intelligence the company in the world [noise]\nUm and after they were bought by alphabet flight school\nA few years fast and Google asked them to examine the energy use them their server farms the biggest server farms of any company in the world and without any new hardware\nAnd without any new hardware\nBut just with the application of artificial intelligence to\nIt must be at a highly structured data that had been collected painstakingly over a long period of time a\nDay we're able to\nReduce the energy use by fifty six percent increase our sort of processing information know hardware changes just\nA more intelligent management of the electrons and beat to use a centrally uh and and there are tens of thousands of use cases where this can be of law at and it is beginning to be applied elsewhere [noise] I'll let them tell their story about the other examples that are non public yet\nBut basically many executive teams are now acquiring the ability to manage um electrons ad on these molecules\nWith the same precision the IT companies have used in managing bits of information we've seen demand destruction in energy use began to accelerate\nBecause they look at the same same or eleventh I think it's going to be around here of this week you know a ... ah I've always learned a lot from a memory of if I can absorb it as fast without a doubt [noise]\nUm but but um [noise] um he he\nGives the many examples of the same exact thing I'm a happening with\nThe the management of energy demand a and of course we another cause for optimism is that the same a radical\nA cost reduction curves that we many of us first became aware of all with Moore's law and comparing chips now was sequencing is coming down eight times faster than Moore's law\nA ... and there are lots and lots of these cost reduction curves that reflect the sustainability revolution a ... and ... and what we're seeing\nHow it is hyper efficiency new business models the kind of disruption that came with the digital revolution and we're now seeing in the physical world\nI often talk about the extent to which everything had to pay for technological change which thinking paying attention where else has been found and then expect and even if they look and things like what happened in the solar energy space and entered the what happened to type ... what's happening in the pride\nAnd when that thing that people like that than those high says Curtis ... is is that part\nYeah I totally the least cost reduction curves are perhaps most visible\nAh with renewable energy Eighteen years ago the best projections\nFor wind energy worried that the world would be able to install thirty gigawatts by twenty ten\nWe've now beaten that a goal by Eighteen times over mhm ah sixteen years ago the best projections were\nOn solar or the the world would be able to install a one gigawatt per year by twenty ten when twenty ten arrived to be that goal by Seventeen times over last year they beat at Ninety eight times over\nAnd ... this exponential curve is still a scene getting deeper and deeper and moving up faster and faster the number of\nPV cells installed\nA the cost has been coming down dramatically are already here in the United states there are five times\nAs many jobs in solar as in coal ah ah the ... the single ... according to the bureau of Labor Statistics the single fastest growing jobs in America\nOr his solar installer it's growing nine times [laughter] Astor than than average job growth second fastest growing jobs is so when turban technicians there are the famous um\nA coal museum in Kentucky or just install solar panels on the truth\n[laughter] I don't know how to put out a press release [laughter] sure\nI've got a little bit in the morning and then of course we're going to have a main delegation has a people from around the world during the Columbus some that you know and they they were named to try and write about fat as a source of\nOptimism or you can turn that access to take a country like math and population ... for me to tell about\nThe electricity and delivering system will miss carving based or not correct about that American markets and they opt in there and that he might have found\nTo me yeah well the analogy that I have often used I think it is a a way of understanding how this works and that is to cell phones\nAre in Nineteen eighty I'm a TNT\nAsking McKenzie to estimate how many of those first generation cell phones they can sell by two thousand and the answer came nine hundred thousand [noise] when the two thousand arrived I did sell nine hundred thousand of them in in the first three days of the year\n[noise] and for a year as a whole hundred twenty times\nSays [laughter]\nAnd and there were three reasons why they were way wrong way or the cost came down much faster than anyone expected even as the the technology improved dramatically there'll be another round of improvements by he read in the press at least that apple has another announcement tomorrow\nOr but the third reason for this huge explosion of the use of mobile phones is that the ... the majority of the people in the world lived in areas that had no land line telephones grits so they leap frog\nAnd now you have places in East Africa for example that make large\nA more intensive usa banking by phone and all kinds of services of by phone cutting company I'm coping has sold five hundred thousand or a D.C a solar powered television sets out in villages that have no electricity can read\nThey would be much more extensive\nThat\nI guess we're going\nTo ... over and ... that's going on you know they can still find youngest activity\nYeah yeah or if you look at it on a global basis\nOr taxpayers around\nThe world are being required to subsidize the burning of fossil fuels\nAt a rate thirty eight times\nThan the meager subsidies for renewable energy\nIn the U.S too it's not as bad as that I think it's twenty four okay as much and and this is of course manifestly of absurd ... and ...\nIf you if you look at what we're we're treating the atmosphere is an open sewers where half an hour says as most people realize the atmosphere the sky is not a vast and limitless expand system extremely narrow shell surrounding the planet and we're putting a hundred and ten million tons\nOf manmade heat trapping gas\nInto that shell\nAs if it's an open sewer we tell people oh you have millions of tons of of ah the toxic gaseous ways to harm broke out gaseous waste just dump it in the sky we don't care or you know charge about ... you know will bump dumped out on\nThe environmental extra nowadays and future generations so yes that ought to be included in the metrics by what was that we use to measure\nThe value of decisions of the choices that we May of course\nSo we are fighting and in fact I got to try\nSaying both test I think so important one for me to say a little bit about\nTo me All right Ken\n... and they were having\nHurricane pictures here whether hurricanes lines have to climate\nChair okay uh well first of all the before you even get to the hurricanes have there been any fires in California this year are you know the Mendocino Complex fire was the largest far in the history of California\nAre that fire tornado or at wards of half a mile across at the base and a one thousand four hundred degrees hundred and sixty mile a hundred and forty mile an hour winds\nAnd every year the record is broken here now the drought and the four corners region I mean I can go through the list but let's just talk for a second about Hurricane Florence says on the way it is crossing a part of the Atlantic ocean where the temperature of the water is three and a half\nDegrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal\nSo it has intensified at a record or near record rate it's up to a cat for I think it's going to get into a category five\nOr ... and so\nThe number of hurricanes are so iconic storms hurricanes typhoons ... around there all the same thing they have different names like an ocean basins or the ... the absolute number doesn't increase the number of big ones increases dramatically\nAnd one reason is as the water is warmer the convection energy drives the wind speeds or to to much higher level and the warming now goes down in the ocean Ninety percent of the heat we're trapping everyday kind of going into the oceans and it's now penetrating deeper than two thousand meters\nSo hurricanes as they approached the land instead of turning up the cold water\nAre in short short cutting the conviction energy\nWhen the water is hot all the way to the bottom then they just keep on building in strength so that's that's one thing I can see level is already higher so the storm surges greater and here's the other factor that you will see play out on the news if the if the projections by the meteorologists are are correct\nThey normally the northern hemisphere jetstream moves to weather systems across the north American continent but as we saw with Hurricane Harvey last year in Houston, Texas\nOr the jet stream has been getting much one way of ear and episodic disorganized thing\nAnd so we get these periods where weather systems just are locked in place for multiple days in a row of last year and in Harris County Texas party which came over much warmer waters\nOff it stayed there for five days and if you think Ken in your mind about Niagara Falls and how giant they are\nFive hundred and nine days worth of the full flow of Niagara Falls ... was dumped in five days on Texas\nAnd Louisiana and in Harris County though it got up to the five feet of rain and they're talking now thirty inches to say\nI predicted for parts of the Carolinas because again if you look on the news I mean every night on the TV news I say this off and is like a nature right through the book of revelations a ... and [noise]\nAnd you know often the news media doesn't connect the dots what people are saying whoa this is unusual or ... and they're now predicting that this Hurricane Florence is not only going to be a massive hurricane\nAnd drop and an enormous amount of rain but is that it's going to stay there for days at a time and the south eastern quadrant extending over the ocean as Hurricane Harvey did last year\nA continues to replenish the moisture in the storm we got five percent more humidity in the in the atmosphere of the earth today than in Nineteen eighty\n... cause we're we're disrupting the water cycle that's one of the bases of life by the dramatically increasing the amount of water vapor coming off the ocean into this guy so we get these rain bombs\nOr like the one after the fire it in Santa Barbara last year at us and they got a rain bombs in that that led to the ... so there are multiple factors are underway at the same time and\nWe've only mentioned a few of them but look at some point we have got to collectively say uh we can\nMorning we have got to collectively say [noise] ah [noise] we can't go on like this [noise]\nThe scientist for ... years ago one Hurricane Florence phenomena that Hurricane Florence is the fact that\nThe scientists were right on almost everything they forget about the climate crisis decades ago should cause us to pay more attention\nTo what they're saying it will happen in the future if we don't your average around me and started the icing the global economy at a very rapid rate and it will bracing this sustainability revolution and creating a world that we can say to our kids and grandkids\nLive is the best we can do we did not closer ours we did not turn away we ... we live we're paying attention we're going to do the right thing [noise]\n\n\nI I kind of iffy I mentioned that you have had two major way for many ways and express your activism lawn is true that the nonprofit we just talked about which is very intellectual around the world and two is really a starting out and running out of a very\nFor for profit standing ... investment\nA operation will be discussing\nThe importance of good private capital you know I'm so not only go\nReally care about using their investment dollars and you are in contact your\nYour insurance on the ... you know who who's managing or ... ... the amount of money that's allocated in decisions in the private sector is a vast multiple of all the money allocated him in government budget\nGovernments have to play the leading role and I'll say that again oh God the private sector\nAnd particularly the ... structure\nOf a can play a crucial role in navigating this this shift toward sustainability absolutely so everybody can be involved you know in their personal lives and in their economic lives and their political wise and he will share and\nThat basically a\nLarge percentage of investors\nThree quarters are actually talk about the state and ability as one of their ... or ...\nAnd ... among the Lenny over the even higher\nMore than ... percent so so it's really ended up support in there to know that the activism that you\nDemonstrated in both parts of the political mobilization making phone calls training people to go out and do grassroots organization is also being met by a flow of interest and dollars from private investors\nThat both of those things possible\nBasically all the time [noise]\n\n\n\nReturn from former vice president Al Gore\nHe was in conversations with economists Laura Tyson UC Berkeley after the break my co host ray Suarez will sit down with two grassroots leaders discuss strategies used and lessons learned and what they call those types of their lifetimes\nAnd that's what we see all over the world and we see it in this country as well that within the United states low income communities communities of color are the ones\nNext to the coal projects the fracking wells the pipelines and are the ones who are on the front lines of impacts and so this is a story about\nClimate change impacting the poor impacting people who have very little with which to respond\nHaving said that there is a tremendous amount of organizing and resilience in these very same communities this is a story about people rising up and doing everything that they can but the risks are very big\nBut a young person listening to this program with let's say twenty eight twenty nine years old might say look I'm not a shareholder I'm not accompanied director what how what influence there was a young person really have\nWell I can think of three things right off the bat that young people arguing and can do and you know I'm not making these up I'm watching it happened in the form I very eyes the first is young people as participants in our democracy and and democracy is all over the world\nWho vote about climate change who see this as an issue fundamentally about their future and they see it connected to other issues they care about about justice and about economic justice as well\nAnother thing young people can do is they mobilize and we see this over and over again I remember the first time I went to a United Nations climate conference I was still young enough to be and they use delegation when we weren't T shirts that said how old will you be and twenty fifty and the idea was to convey\nHow old will you be in twenty fifty\nAnd the idea was to convey that the people in the ghost shading we're not going to see the worst effects of climate change and we were trying to point out do this for the next generation do this for your children and your grandchildren now of course that's changed we're seeing these impacts in our lifetime\nBut that was an incredibly powerful action that pushes decision makers to take more political courage\nAnd the third thing I Would say is communication and storytelling and young people are right now the masters of social media a lot of the stories that are dominating um news cycles young people are helping consume that media and shape the stories and\nThat is another way that young people are not taking this crisis sitting down but this this is not this dynamic of giving up what can I Do this is so serious\nWe seen this in social movements throughout history and if people give up if people gave up over struggles for civil rights for suffrage\nFor the right to vote the right to\nLive in a non segregated society where would we be today so I think it's it's a similar situation with young people on the climate crisis they they see the risks they're motivated and when I talked to young people I always start by saying\nI Would be incredibly frustrated if I were getting involved in this movement right now and my hat is off to you for your commitment given the political challenges we face\nNone of the room and you're an Indonesian island of very ... of chain of islands were very large population thousands of those islands are small enough to actually be threatened with being inundated do Indonesians\nDo people in the Malaysia or do people facing this uh actually think you have a things I Do\nCan make a difference to what happens downstream\nEven though now I live in the United states but I keep my a connection to my sisters and brothers in Indonesia\nAnd um this is our uh issue but ... is a global issue but uh we are impacted locally\nAnd I think as ... we see ourselves as a very ... a quiz show a ... a ticking crucial role as well as a strategic\nSo last year we started to have this campaign on Frank to\nPilot a thousand mosques using solar energy so not just the moms for example talking about protecting the earth in the mosque from the book that but also people and community started to see\nThat it's a solar panel in my mosque and then they take a pride on it and then we can use that as a mode of\nEducation or two people and I think like\nEach individual kings can a take on their own uh actions are a lot of people are told me that oh I'm just a one percent I cannot make a difference but I said flip it on another way even a small steps that you do\nA little we'll get by that into ... million ten million a hundred million\nAnd if you see that it's like you know if like millions of people doing the same thing like you is that it's going to make a difference and people are not to say yes\nThat is you don't like that if the scale so\nThat's the spirit that we want to bring two people that they're not just one person that we are on this boat together and we will work together to make a difference and we're supporting each other so\nUh I think I'm very hopeful I think because I'm from uh the faith communities hope is the the thing that the fate can offer\nTo all of this devastation that we are facing at this time\nI think one of the toughest parts of this conversation is to imagine what equity looks work\nNon us from a part of the world was tremendous aspirations they want to live the way they see people in imported movies and TV shows living they want the good things when you open up the door of an apartment or a house to have the things that they see\nA other people in the world having and then they find old now now are we going to have to have a simplicity movement before you guys get rich we got rich by getting the dirty for a century\nBut now now that we're already rich we're going to say okay now it's time for simplicity that's a tough sell to the young people of the rest of the world isn't it\nYou're exactly right and\nHere I'd like to point out that that aspect one of the worst at impacts of Trump pulling the U.S out of the Paris Agreement is our commitment to the green climate fund and a commitment to actually support the transition off of fossil fuels and supporting adaptation to climate change for countries in the global south so\nThat's just one example of many\nWhere we see these inequities play out and I agree with you visualizing what this looks like\nRequires a lot of imagination and I think the people doing most of that imagination are the frontline communities are the people who are trying to figure out what is adjust transition actually if we recognize the severity of climate change\nWhat does that mean in our community what does that mean for the kind of jobs that are created what does that mean for people who currently don't have a job and the only job available is building a pipeline\nAnd trying to visualize that there is examples right here in the bay area in Richmond, California people trying to live into this equitable future\nNone of them and how do you talk about these things to the millions of you\nIn Cairo in Kuala Lumpur in Jakarta in the southern islands or the Philippines how do you say well now the the world has been filled up with carbon\nBy France and Britain and Russia and the United states now we're going to come to your parts of the world under threat\nAnd say look or you're just not going to be able to live in that wasteful dirty way that people lived fifty years ago or six years ago while they were getting rich\nClimate change is not just an economic issue or political issue or even scientific issue but it's also like\nA moral and ethical crisis we need to put that on the table first that uh we share that climate change is a moral issue or ethical issue so that we would they use in the global south or in the developing world that\nThe being bombarded every day with pictures and you know like all this films like a like try to live like they're they're ... years in the northern or develop worlds then we need to\nAppears in the northern or develop worlds then we need to really sit together like all these use like a homeless have this idea is that that we can have built this a solidarity together that\nWe want the future or to look different not like what the you know like the former generation has been developing this world before but we want ask young generation to create our own future that we want like may sat", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
