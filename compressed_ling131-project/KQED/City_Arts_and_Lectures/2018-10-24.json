[noise]\nSo I've I've heard you say that one of the things that you're going to a almost invariably of telling the difference between right and wrong\nAlways always that's almost invariably invariably\nSo how does it feel to live in a post truth society\nI mean I I'm really stunned by the idea that this is it in some way or the things people can figure out to\nMe you know it's so simple Vicente simplest things in the world you know people say how did you develop your moral compass you know\nEveryone should have this this is not complicated you know I mean it's not like well I don't

not leave my apartment would that people yelling at me\nThe ... you were wrong you're wrong I Know I'm Sorry I I'm really sorry\nSo to change the subject a little bit a highschool memories are in the news a lot these days\nAnd I wonder if you could share some of your own there there's nothing like it [noise] I didn't know that was available that um [noise]\nI hated high school ... Eiffel I ... I hate school period I like grammar school I'd love to our school I was fantastic wherever school I was\nSo I was such an outstanding grammar school student you would not believe that these are when I was in grammar school the main thing we had to do as far as I can recall is drawn pilgrims\n[noise] and the ... and we love the ... by the way the owners are good and and the Indians love them too because they were shut them how to Thanksgiving um so I Would love to drawing\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by extending the firm Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why pie for all devices and the home\nAnd I imagine that someday someone would say there there'd be like a pope emergency and did what they want to hear draw tell them I say I can I can [noise] but once I got to high school in\nYou know I mean something that you know desperate daily just it just didn't like that you know I don't know what's gonna happen and it's true that is I mean often have my head I could name you a dozen people a Democrat but things are going to be the next president you know and I'm sure there doesn't Republicans who think that um and and part of that is because\nNo one even the Republicans really thinks this guy's really a president\nSo I mean sometimes I'm On the subway and I sit there and I think to myself when\nThose doors open the first person who comes through those doors would be a better president Donald Trump\n[noise]\nAnd this is true even if that person is in a stroller [noise]\n\nWell [noise] one be the good news about the future for all of you is that uh the next part of the show belongs to you or I'm going to turn it over to you and for him and ... and we'll take questions from the audience for them extra\nForty five minutes or so however long for em wants to be years you will do that so I'm going to say goodbye to your friend thank you very much and I'm going to join the audience or we love having your your your wonderful thank you very much [noise]\n\nBut I just want to say that they do something here that I ordinarily do not allow him\nLet me that I never allow um which is they are going to make sure the audience because they have a pod cashed nothing I Know what that is um [noise] something like a radio shown so I Will you raise your hand ... knew someone with a regular phone will approach you on this will make a date\nWe'll call I knew someone with a regular phone will approach you on this will make it takes longer but there'll be able to hear you on the ...\nUm I have a question regarding like your experience with ... where are you I'm right here and think\nOkay [laughter]\nOr I'm everywhere um\nI guess in terms of developing or trust as a writer\nAnd ...

Indiana is the kind of I Know it's not really in the south but it's kind of in the south I'm\nYou know Trump sound depends on the same way he found I'm\nKevin they ...\nThey know truthfully if we ever took power in a real way the first thing we have to get or these which [noise] you know when I start putting these people in jail I Want to list they do they have a list and list of these people\nLeave all what I was sitting next to the person years ago when they ask questions\nIs your favorite hot you're too young ... no I'm not and it was really when you do we had a conversation after the fact about it\nAnd to this day it's hysterical thank you so much\nAs well you know perhaps we'll have another hostage crisis and it'll come up again [laughter] [noise]\nIt's questions from the balcony\nSwitching gears I'm more serious side I just wanted to ask where did you get those ... [noise]\nI Hope to her where did you get those boats I design these boots\nThese are unless someone is copy may not impossible the only ... taboos in the world um I just I knew was the person who made these\nBoots was so impossible shut you\nSo crazy that once I finally got these boots which took him two years to make I mean you think it was an essay taking\nThat law took him two years to make I thought take care of each was friends you're never going through this again and so people very often say oh you know who made your booze would you recommend them I say I would not recommend him\nOf this guy who lived in Texas\nUm for two years kept calling me in line to me\nOn this guy was a very good looking guy in a very sleazy way and he was coming off his lifetime blind to women show he would constantly call me goes I'm really shy him and the Toronto airport and I was going to have to go to Dallas on it and I said I'm ...

[noise]\n...\nHi ... nice to meet you Hi nice to be I Would invite you to be in my perfect\nWorld for a minute where it's past twenty twenty and the Democrats of taking back the house they repealed everything that's gone wrong in the last year and a half and we're looking towards our new president and it's you and\nWhat would you do in the first one hundred day\nI wouldn't need a hundred days [noise]\nWhy why would you take a hundred age [noise]\nI made it sound like you have to write something something really hard [laughter]\nYou mean everything's already repealed everything is perfect is that what you're saying everything's already perfect that I Would say\nI'm finished [laughter] and get on that swelled plane which surely he does not deserve um\n[noise] you know there are as you know I mean\nThere's not five minutes go by\nBunker ship of the cake you read the live stream finish the firm Comcast with expanding the customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with Kennedy on demand\nThe president of the United states addresses the UN and there's less that\nI mean\nIt's actually pretty astonishing especially to me who as a child I had to childhood idols one was Leonard Bernstein and moments that commercial\nUm you probably heard of ... design you may not have heard that before he was the director general of the UN um I have that many books by that ... have this photograph refrigerator\nUm and so I always think what would that commercial think of this um when I was a child or when they took our class you know from school for a tour of the un I Know when I was like maybe nine years old and I was incredibly excited because I thought I Would see that commercial\nUm and I had a book by about ... and I brought it with me and I were walking around the UN or they can figure out who's going to see him and\nSo a man in his shoe walk by and I thought it was that Congress votes so I have left the line we were always marsh around like my height and then a lot\nAnd I listen line and went after him and then I couldn't find them 'cause there were many men in suits and I couldn't tell which one he was and so I pushed a door to where I thought he'd gone through an every alarm and the UN went off\n[noise]\nAnd I ... a policeman came over and I burst into tears and I said there wasn't that much security though then obviously if I was even able to do this and I kept saying I saw I saw a commercial they thought it was and how much will the guy didn't really know who their coverage for was um [noise]\nSo that for me the un I once spoke at the un not to the general assembly um and I was incredibly excited to be at the un I'm Donald Trump um ... you may have missed dish but before he was president his only comment about the UN was he didn't like the ... and that he could get them a better deal\n[noise] on the marble tile um so\nI Will I truthfully things that have Abraham Lincoln came back to life it would take a decade to repair\nThe damage that Trump has done I really do do you know uh [noise] I Can't really tell you what I could accomplish in a hundred days um but except for Abraham Lincoln more than most [noise]\nYou know put your knocking on your lap don't put your head don't reach over someone do grammar less has all this stuff nonstop this is my childhood summed up I Would say to my mother can I please have an apple and my mother would say married please have an apple and I would say that we have an apple and she would say no [noise]\nShow consequently I had excellent matters\nThe most I can hope for in that regard is I've lately been trying to bring back the phrase You're welcome\nBecause here's what happens now ... says thank you for coming than the other person says thank you for having me Oh thank you for comes and goes on forever [noise]\nI've lately been saying that people feel safe they give becoming I'll say You're welcome and they look at me like you are so rude [noise]\nSure if you mean civility like in the Senate is apparently there was there was this time\nWhere the senators walked off arm in arm you know in some wonderful our friendship I'm certainly much\nBetter than it is now I'm there that would certainly be better um you know there's constant talk about how partisan politics have become I mean is it in a way kind of funny I mean\nPolitics partisan politics is redundant you know apologies are part of it and that's the point of holidays that's about as um the problem with ... that that their parties and the problem with politics of Republicans [noise]\n\nI'm would you please tell us a little bit about your participation in law and order [laughter] um\n[laughter] I have is that what I please tell you or at least term I'm about my participation law and order which was a TV show um where\nI played um I had a um a recurring part as arraignment judge\n'em I got this part by begging them\nTo give me that\nI knew I pay them more because they don't play the police captain him and uh that that I met the walls who invented this thing and I should you put me on the I I Love loner I still love law and order I Love it there's not the only thing I Know that other people find other ways we're latch yoga spies you know [noise]\nI'm not the spot or you might imagine but whatever that music as they've done that others like three I hear that I'd become the Dalai Lama [noise]\nI become suddenly relaxed and one of my biggest objections to present the\nPopular culture is why there is not a law and order channel [noise]\nBig guys that's the only thing I ever want to see on television is water and show they actually first\nI'm a we're going to give me this part as a real judge 'em and I had to go and audition for him and the producers sit there and I I did the audition and I knew I was horrible and the second I stopped I said look I Know it was really bad I said you know this person too big for me I'm don't give me this part\nGive me an arraignment judge part because that's really bruised by two sentences\nAnd the British just had a friend actors don't say I Know I failed the audition so give me a different part I said I Know but I'm not an actor so I can say it so they didn't give me this part\nIt was fantastic because first of all you afterwards a judicial robe which the law and order was done on film show it was just like shooting a movie shows you know the work gauge even if you were on for two minutes or like you know twelve sixteen hours you'd be there forever\nI'm ... I Would arrive I Would go to the wardrobe department put on my ...\nThey would say friends you don't have to the robot now oh that joking\nAbout [noise] and I remember\nThey shot it and then Chelsea Studios which are on the river where they were just started then to build now is finished unfortunately this past you know for people to like ride bicycles and skateboard and like the whole city turn into some summer camp\n[noise] and I was outside smoking\nCigarettes where am I robe and this kid came Corrine down on a skateboard this kid was like a million tattoos and piercings and they saw me and you stop like that and he said I didn't know there was of course here\nAnd I said there's a court everywhere\n[noise]\nSo I I really love I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed the law and order I I also real ... uh every other judge on TV copied me because when you said at the bench which is the best she'd ever in any room in the world\nYou know you sit there you're hired then everyone else you have a real comfortable chair and you have a gamble\nBecause the gamble is there I jumped to like begging the devil\nAnd I instantly got dozens of letters from lawyers and judges many from judges you are not supposed to gamble you're not gamble is for by the way to judge you are not supposed to go unless there is an outburst or something in the courtroom um however now every single television judge capitals [noise]\n\nIn Arizona simple thing you can't not ... it's [noise] I Can't tell you what a pleasurable thing this is think about it you have a hammer\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by Sandy from Comcast it's been at the Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nUm [noise] uh\nI I Know we're Paul I mean I've actually met Ron Paul\nIs is a TV show right the drags it wherever you are that it's like a contest for drag queens\nWhich is now on television I mean this is a kind of thing that we used to be like a very covert thing because it was against the law so it was very covert it was extremely different and now it's on television and this is apparently the most progress we can hope for\nYou know so I mean [noise]\nI have nothing against is if people find that entertaining um she's kind of funny as a person\nI'm here still so many call he I'm assuming I mean no disrespect um and ... but in the seventies for instance uh\nSometimes I Would be at a party or someplace and someone would come in with drag and I would always say how'd you get there 'cause you could not walk on the street like that you'd be arrested you could not be on the shopping like that you know only candy could do that because people thought that she was a girl\nShe didn't really look like a girl but never heard anyone that a man was wise that\nYou know so there was an upside to this oppression by the way I'm which is that you know she didn't walk around like that um I Know that now it's like a it's so interesting that we live in a country I think this is a very popular TV show\nUm which means that many many people in the country like fish and think is fine and it's okay and they still vote for Donald Trump\nShow you know these things or you know are not always how they look you know this is not always a sign of you know being progressive I'm at\nThe ... parishes bringing was about um [noise] I Can't see what it's called them these contests\nVogue and that's where I go to those ... things I used to go to them on they were ... they were fantastically interesting because they're completely invented you know that ah and I remember that when I did interview for Paris is burning 'em a lot of people that we're talking about that then you know imagine to me what was interesting about it\nWas that it was mistaken at that time for some kind of humanism which in fact it's the opposite is desire to be conventional that causes that not the desire to be rebellious you know you don't have to be rebellious if everyone already hate you show\nThat I think there's just things that people don't really understand it as this shows interesting to me that it ended up as a popular network television show 'em and I was very popular I don't think that real voting exist anymore there's no way that it could be 'cause you could afford to rent those places\nHigh friend I'd I'd love to know your take on the me too movement\nOkay she left on my take on me too movement because you think that might have some contrary opinion like that idea or um [noise]\nThis is one of the things that I have found some pretty surprising you know I never imagined this would happen not necessarily in years because being a woman was the shame from like IV [noise] until like six months ago [noise]\n\nSo naturally\nIt never occurred to me this one ever change\nYou know and so it ... it really changed I mean the first you know I don't know the first dozen guys who got caught I Know every single one of them personally and if you told me one minute before that these guys would be ... I Would never believed in a million years\nNow in a million years now I have to say I mean like hardly for instance I think it was the first one um I Know Harvey for a million years I Know a million stories about hardy I\nBelieve every single one of them but I never heard these rape stories\nI never heard this violence George I never heard them be and that is because you know it's one thing like ... I'm going to get a partner movie which by the way that the definition for that would always have been the movie business I'm In the but the the ... the violence and read I never heard that I heard a million stories about Charlie Rose I never heard the stories\nAbout these interns you know I never heard the stories", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "24"}
