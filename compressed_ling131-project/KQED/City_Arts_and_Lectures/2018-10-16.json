needs the European Union in March what will it mean for the relationship between Northern Ireland which is part of Britain and the republic of Ireland its neighbor how can each prepare for ...\nJoining need to consider these questions is O'Toole he's a journalist for the Irish Times and the author of the forthcoming book Brexit the politics of pain just broadcast is made possible each week by the generally support and Chevron medium rare and the Draper Richards Kaplan foundation\nThe ... the referendum and twenty sixteen I seen as having had an enormously divisive of fact I Want to have a sense from you as to\nTo break down off of oh it is interesting since Northern Ireland Scotland voted remain um but your sense of of what was behind the vote what was behind they [noise] they positive outlook on on the side of the English and allow\nSo obviously when you get something as large as if they're going to be many factors feeding into that but I think the biggest ones is something that's and I blame myself as much that we should have St coming\nOn stocks nobody really saw coming out of this English nationals [laughter] if you look at the Brexit vote it's I'm\nVery largely concentrated and non metropolitan England so if you take out loans on the monitor the other major cities\nWere loaned them from the you know the cop swallows and ... and the Tories Shires up to the old state will turn around and say all working class hotlines or of all of those ... are the places that which the Brexit vote is sixty five Seventy even eighty percent\nOf the reason we should have seen this coming laws because something extraordinary was happening that was happening quietly um but nonetheless was really showing up very much and and social surveys [noise]\nUh which was that the English were beginning to assert themselves as a political community there were beginning to say actually you know what the British thing when we're not that interested in it anymore we wants to be English\n[noise] nobody paid much attention to this because no political party was was driving is the media would largely ignored it hit so so often like it was something that was you know people were made total feels\nSo it was our guy and it was it was coming out of I think in retrospect things that we should have expected the English are very proud nation that they you know a very long history um\nSponsorship of the cake humid Eli dream bike super Mike Rowe Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at uber Mike Rowe dot com\nFrom the laws they had all the things that you would have said when I should say very early on a very strong proud I'd have to take\nWhy are we surprised that it's coming back while we're surprised because it did an extraordinary thing in a way it's such a fake its own death and [laughter] it it rolled itself into two other constructs one of which was the empire of course and the other fish was the union with sweat Scotland ...\nOn islands or from from Eighteen hundreds and English and this was sort of contained within these all the structures\nSo if those two structures change well then you would expect English history in March and the empire they've gone or not everybody knows that but it ...\nAnd the union began to change radically in like Nineteen Ninety two big things happen like Ninety Ninety the about fast peace agreements in Northern Ireland Nineteen Ninety eight and the following year the Scottish parliament's was established\nBut once you begin to see coming up really in surveys the into the beginning of the century is the English was drawing mentally from the union\nAnd we should have seen this twenty eleven national census the last census was taking them to UK a large majority of people in England offered the choice do you think of yourself as British British and English or English large majorities that English only\nAnd they also the big surveys were asking things like who represents England's who should make the laws for England's their most basic questions do you think it's OK the Westminster the part of the ... the union parliament investments are makes all spring lived\n[noise] no [laughter]\nSuddenly the English are saying no\nIn in in twenty trials big survey asked that question do you think the status quo where Westminster makes a loss for England is okay\nTwenty four percent English people said yeah it's okay to stop squirrels okay three quarters of them are saying I don't want my laws for me as an unjust parts made in Westminster this is extraordinary stuff and we weren't paying attention to because there was no there was no political movements there was no real media attention paid to it [noise]\nBut this was going to emerge somewhere I don't know it emerged in a kind of frustration that nobody's listening to us nobody nobody pays attention numbers even naming the fact that we think of ourselves as the fantasy and wants to be recognized as such as\nThe first opportunity that English got to give somebody a kick and say pay attention to us was was the ... ... and therefore in retrospect it's not that surprising that they took that opportunity to say we want to be paid attention to\nThe irony is that breaks it actually doesn't answer any of those questions you know it really doesn't meet the needs that were there\nBut I think this is an underlying for someone we're still grappling with what are the implications of\nThe rising of nationalism for Scotland's for ... for for Ireland's a because of course we all intertwined for for so long that uh if if if this is happening it's it's it's seismic in terms of all of those relationships with no\nSo this assistance to to integration is there are some real world a anxieties they had the euro zone crisis the economic crisis that census\nHave contagion white hair entering the um immigration was a larger issue um where there are others that that they were literally ... issue oriented that that ... that drove it as well as I said the sense of resentment\nYes so I ... I I think there are a ... one of the biggest underlying it is a really coming from the from the rights and you know the right thing and it's already policy is you have to remember those are very strong agenda to complete the agenda of ... you know the patch or Islam\nThis markets philosophy that says a breaking up to staked\nHanding over the public services that maybe the ... all those kinds of things to market forces\nWas never complete tips mhm [noise] and the European Union is seen as a kind of super states I'm Out of there for a constraint on um the the finals yet ... destiny so coming from the from from a very influential section of the story partially you've got that driver [noise]\nBut it meets something completely different threat which is that's not what's appealing to the working class communities in in some little tricks up literally for breakfast that they want the opposite they won ...\nStates protect them they want all of his public services say they want to see all the security [noise] so Brandon is is it in in this sense yes it's driven by all of these kinds of things but they're they're awesome complete opposites and\nThe key to the ... the referendum was David Cameron's extraordinary Arabs in one very simple respects\n[noise] while he could have done as he could have lifted the phone and he could have spoken to his good friend the our prime minister at the time at the Kennedy and said you guys do referendum so in our we have a referendum about something almost every year we have a written constitution and it can be changed by popular vote but so we have a referendum almost every year we have we have reference of\nWi Fi California yeah well you know ... we don't exactly what we've had like really big ones like ... you know this year we we we voted on abortion which is really divisive issue and and liberalize emotional those\nTwo years ago we we brought in same sex marriage but if I'm so we know how we don't have to do the stuff we know how it works\nAnd it would have been really if things are cameras just said look okay how does this thing work when you called reference about what actually really\nThings are cameras just said look okay how does this thing work when you called referendum I from what I actually really happens\nHands before they got a guy would have told them as it it won't be justified as lots on the ballot paper you know a referendum if people all sorts of emotional outlets you know to to to say I'm really angry about this and therefore I'm going to take it out on them you know in in this moment [noise]\n... to write on the Irish border there are two hundred and eight\nOfficial border crossings right\nTo have to be a team of civil service joined seamless those arms from North and south a whip brags instructor and how many border crossings and other they came up with two hundred Ninety but everybody knows that that it's actually an infinite number because in a lot of cases it's somebody's feels it's a it's a little strange that you could put soup planks across it\nYou have to remember this was never designed to be a border that it's it's if it was you would you know if you were designing bars he would fire to people's came up with this law because in its square goes around all sorts of things\nYou can you can be driving along and you may have crossed the border five times without knowing it you know it just does all over the place to reason is because it was never meant to be a border it was [noise]\nSupposed to be a kind of temper rearrange once\nWhen the island was partitions in Nineteen Twenty one there was kind of very disputed agreements that that's a that's six northeastern counties would remain Pakistan kingdom the but the Protestant majority wants it to be part of the u._k.\nOn the twenty six other counties would which what Catholic majorities uh would would would form the Irish ... states which became the actual public\nOn the border question was kind of left over to the vet actually it's very complicated\nWhy don't we set up a board commissioner boundary commission as it was called I'm going to work on a proper border and they spent five years doing this and they couldn't agree so the status quo just remains in place with this kind of crazy border and in a way of solving it didn't matter too much but now with a master's so so what you're saying is that this ...\nSponsorship of the cake weedy life's dream bike super Mike Rowe Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at uber Mike Rowe dot com\nAnd its in its history and could never happen and visits by anybody [noise] I saw this is this is deeply reckless because\nIt's it's just as you know the thing you've been doing over there you Irish people about actually you know we don't care about them anymore we're going to stop and this is not me as an artifact of the things that there's there's there's two pieces of research they asked leave voters there was a big survey to people who voted leave were asked the question very directly\nUm woods the destruction of the Irish peace process be a price worth paying for breakfast eighty three percent of voters said yes\nAbsolutely [laughter] I'm just another survey just out just last week which has pretty much the same thing\nAnd ask conservative members of the conservative are say would you be prepared to throw the peace process to have breakfast is success eighty percent yes absolutely extraordinary I'm I don't want to be most of the ... I I you know ... I don't want to blame people about it but but it is an act of extraordinary recklessness you know to say\nActually we don't really care what's going on over there aren't as I said it's kind of saying you people are far him\nEven violence science I'm insist on your part of the United kingdom this is Britain's own territory this is not you know it's not somewhere off in the mid Atlantic you know this is a place to Britain claims to be an absolutely into real parts of its own territory so\nThose are the kind of reckless here there's no salt advisors there there's there's no real plan\nI sold walk the Irish Government has had to do is to say look\nWe can't trust you on this you know [noise] if so everybody's saying so it looks very simple everybody's saying there cannot be our border and you know the including British governments governments European Union they are almost everybody saying copy have already kind of go back to that so\nThat looks very simple see all the great what's the problem [noise] I signed up just trust us on his will will work out something ah after we've done the deal with the European Union and we're going to get the fabulous deal and it's going to give us you know we're going to have cake and eat cake and everything is going to be just wonderful solve course there'll be no borders I'll be fine\nOn the governments that I I I think we often force if I look we can't take it on trust that it's going to be fine this is this is really serious matter for I mean this this is an existential questions for us [noise]\nAnd you must know plan here you have absolutely no sense at all of of of how you're going to achieve this thing that we all agree even listen shaved [noise]\nSo this is why are you got this I won't bore you with all the the the bureaucratic language but the the stop you may have heard of which is the thing that's now stopping Brexit which is\nThe European Union and the and I ... I actually you're you're you're you're not just the outcome of the European Union in concert with the government is saying\nThere can be no agreements with Britain were not doing any deal with you until you have a guarantee about the fact that there will be no ours Porter enough\nA source of trust us about this but an actual legal international guarantee it has to be placed in stone or something that that and what what the Irish and the Europeans are saying is look if you can come up with another solution\nFine absolutely you know if you think there's something magical technological solution that you can have a border between the European Union and Britain that has no infrastructure tall never existed in human history from do you think you can do it they'll find where all eyes with\nBullets all we're saying is if you count as a fail safe which is that your guarantee that there won't be one and therefore you gonna have to do certain other things\nAnd of course the other things mean that really the only way that I think this can work it still is if the u._k. has a very soft brings us if it stays within the European customs union and in large parts of the single market\nBut of course that's exactly what I'm saying is that they will not on Fox fly the you're the ... the talks are in such a quagmire I mean they've been unable to move forward on it's all about the Irish issue and that the Irish issue is absolutely central to the whole thing\nI took my example of the return of the repressed you know if you if you don't talk about it if you would know or is it going to come back and bite you and that's really what's happening with breakfast\nAnd so what are the chances of a compromise in which Northern Ireland can ah can in fact be separated from breakfast they allowed to be part of the new even now as part of the United kingdom so they they\nTo be fair to let them have often been a critic of the but it's it's actually been pretty extraordinary on this issue um\n[noise] so that they even negotiation that Michelle Burnette who's leading the same I'm On the ... really are everybody from the inside of spoken about this a sense but part is that it's simply that there are three things the British officers out before we can get into talking about the final a\nField what what their relationships I looked like people's money\nPeople is just mutual writes between you know senator decay going to be living in European Union countries one of their rights and vice versa you know complicated bit of to and fro ing but as I you know it's it's normal diplomacy right it's a source posted negotiators to it's fixable it's pretty much agreed [noise]\nMoney it was a divorce sales right which was how much does how much how many ongoing commitments to the u._k. half of the European Union budget is the ... like it too in terms of money\n[noise] it's not like some sort of about forty billion pounds starling is fine it's done you know that that's kind of great our lives and when it's not great but for all the reasons we've been talking about [noise] and\nI genuinely think the British they'll look up to the ...\nOur lumps people is just mutual writes between you know says decay gonna be living in European Union countries one of their rights and vice versa no complicated bit of to and fro ing but as I you know it's it's normal diplomacy writes us are supposed to negotiators to it's fixable it's pretty much agreed [noise]\nMoney was a divorce sales right which was how much does have much how many ongoing commitment says you have the European Union budget is the ... like it too in terms of money\n[noise] and trying to make sense with about forty billion pounds darling it's fine it's done you know that that's kind of great our lives when it's not great but for all the reasons we've been talking about [noise] and\nI genuinely think the British do look up to the Irish are kind of small you know when it comes to it ran as the big kind of stand on the last minute some of the way these things are dumb we'll just fudge the Irish that come on you know it took ... you know there'll be a formula words [noise]\nAnd I think they miscalculated really fundamentally about this you know that they thought I could be bullied but they also saw the European Union would say oh the arts bloody Irish that's you know forget about it on his practice has not happened to have him being a single cigarette paper between the artist edition of the European Union position [noise] so what European Union has done as as being very generous and it said look\nI just really difficult for us where a rule bounds organization the your opinion is just a set of rules and if we start playing fast and loose with those rules will say well you can do a bit of this and you can do that a whole thing will collapse however they said look\nI don't know what I was kind of first of all they've suffered a loss right it's a it's it's it's a part of the world that are really hard time secondly it's small it's a million and a half people it's not going to threaten the entire structure of the European Union so less be generous let's say in your case\nYou can have the best of both worlds threat we're not saying you have to leave the u._k.\nSo therefore legally insolvency terms you you'll be leaving the European Union however you can continue to act as if you're in the European Union [noise]\nI Wonder if they've done this is because it's a very hard thing to remember but under the peace deal and I cannot jihad piecemeal every single person in Northern Ireland has an absolute rise to the European Union citizenship\nThat cannot be changed my breakfast why because they have a right to Irish Citizenship so he's going to be Irish or British are both the the legal manifestation of that is your enticed what ours passport you're on TALK to our citizenship\nNot the ludicrous thing about this is that it doesn't address at all the reality of the situation Britain's not Canada so it's in Europe it's trade you know is is it's forty percent of the strange with is already with the European Union but also it's tied with the rest of the world's member\nIs done through Tracy's which have been the Gulf state of the of the European Union that there are Seventy five major trade tracing\nSome Britain in this in this circumstance of starting from scratch to elect me\nThey'll say try to I don't know maybe some people have been involved in trade deals I haven't but I've spoken to people how they take a minimum of seven years\nThe candidates elected looking for it took seven years cynical ... know credibly complex I mean you're talking about you know like ... and ... hundreds for you know the most extraordinary goods and services and all sorts of things and\n[noise] um so\nShe's being pushed in this direction she has realized that she has to compromise struck so British industry is now saying\nThis is catastrophic I mean we're we're we're facing possible catastrophe here so as soon as I said but you know for example um [noise] the ... the European aerospace industry the only um rival the house in terms of making plans\nOr is essentially a Franco British creation right so the Airbus planes are made in France and actually largely in Wales and in in ... [noise]\nSo every day huge numbers of aircraft pots go from France So tired of 'em back every single day you know it's completely integrated supply chains [noise]\nThat's just one example menace on bills a five hundred thousand cars a year in Sunderland which voted for breakfast this working class sounds off its biggest employer isn't it sounds Japanese carmaker\nNice found brings in I have to myself when I saw this figure I thought I was wrong I I have to actually go back and check you know but it's actually true they they bring in three million\nAnd day not not a week a day they bring in the mood in parts and say they are as all of these big companies are now they are fully incidents like ... and it's all just in time Nissan have\nA day's stores\nOn hand in children with half a day after half\nA day the plant closes down now if you are saying\nThose three million ... have to be checked [laughter] every day it's just impossible just kind of become so that had a missing them recently came out and say look we we didn't say this during the Brexit referendum 'cause we didn't think it was going to pass\nYou know we just thought if if we interfere with the accused of you know trying to frighten people anything else but I'm really sorry we just have to close and we we just count up you know we just have to do this we've invested billions and as we don't want to do this you know those are the\nState of the ... ah diplomas normally some of the people that really works with some toxic we're allies with us\nBut we cannot be\nHaving terrify non tariff barriers for three million things going in and out of that that's never mind the actual cars that are produced stress if this was in ... I was a profit on this is British industry saying we are facing catastrophe if there's no deal all of this stuff comes to a halt people are out of work\nDoes it does a normal is kind of economic hit one of the political consequences of that who knows however well how ... nobody including through somebody has built up the political off hours hate to say come on folks get real here now\nIn the process is everywhere evolution always has you know fantastic utopian I think it's all going to be grace [noise]\nIt was those people who are stopping us from being wonderful and as soon as we get rid of those people must be wonderful but you know that's the basic knowledge of a revolution and then somebody has to come along at some stage Napoleon or whatever it is I Can't keep doing this you know ... ... ... ... ... you know some kind of rationality has to be applied here\nAnd\nThe problem is that brings it undermines political authority to such an extent in London that there's not a nobody I mean not the government's not the opposition so the Labour Party which is the alternative governments is also completely divided about Brexit is afraid to really say anything very much\nSo once you have is you you have a situation in which there was a real need for pragmatism adverse genuine patriotism somebody says look\nThis is self harm ... it's not in our interest to continue to try to do this stuff at this level somebody has to come in and say there's all sorts of compromises on you won't like some of them that's what pragmatic life is like\nI'm Theresa May if the person is going to have to say that but she has to prepare yourself to be in the ... so she started taking this very extreme position [noise]\nAn over the next two weeks she's going to have to come out to say look you people on average just shut up [laughter] I'm really sorry but you can't keep doing this kind of crazy you know ... nationalist revolution stuff this was people's livelihoods this is this\nBut I don't you remember it ends up it ends up with what they steal all the goals from children the Italians and they're both ... put it onto a Bowl Sunday are getting away in the guardian you know through the the alpine passes and then they take a wrong turn on the bus is left\n... over the cliff us going like that\nAnd that the goal is on one hand and all the crew of criminals are on the other half and if they move towards the goals the bus will you know go off and if they don't move towards the gold and the whole thing is part of that is exactly my rights under the friends that are like how to move forward to to get this prize that they was on that can't get out of the\nUm it's it's really starting to situation so is this loss of authority on everyone's part and on on our part is part is that the greatest danger\nYes I'm a ... and it's it's it's a problem for us in our lives is danger for of course you know we we have no say in this we we we cannot insulin swap that happens in Britain itself\n[noise] um [noise] but you know it's it's it's it's a real lesson to us I think we all ... you know I I'm I'm I'm a professional\nI just had her you know I tried to get made people question about how power is being used and how politics is working all kinds of things I'm after the Democratic duty to do that you know I mean that's one of the guys democracy it's like\nI'm not being super silly us about people who voted for banks that they they engage in in in a political choice [noise]\nBook ... has to be balanced by a sense that actually we all depend on political structures\nThat we may criticize on we may dislike but we with cats Troy those political structures without being very careful as to walk takes their place I'm a ... kind of um institutions like my my my work for us\nAnd the institutions themselves have to have some democratic us urging\nWhat happened in Britain was they use the Democratic mechanisms that they is not part of our culture referendum ... if you look at the entire history of of political self consciousness and in England in particular it's about the sovereignty of parliament that's what you know English history is about\nTo turn around I one of the most critical existential questions that you faced in in in in your mouth and history and say actually this is not going to do the parliament's go it's going to be done by a popular vote\nThat's fine if you think that's true ... how are we going to follow through on that\nBut they haven't done that so they've they've placed on ... in this sacred moments June twenty third tiny sixteen that moment to people spoke\nWith lots of people say you know they said we we don't want to be in that tank [laughter] that's fine but it doesn't really get you very far doesn't tell you how you're going to do this and how are you going to do with with the least south harm [noise]\nI mean in my view it's crazy decision that I think\nI I I I talked to a guy who was a very old I'm tried union ago says or in any sense to me a very pro British guy um and he said\nYou know the only three possibilities if if you're going it's when they'll see ... ... you know as a as a labor leader you say you know one of my ... I'm In this guy's really see possibilities one was to stop the flow which they have rejected\nThe second to something better than the status quo which the European Union could not possibly give a leaving member I mean\n... if you can leave a club I have all the benefits outside of us not to publish gone but ... you know I'm just on this journey the European Union would would dissolve and in five years if the if Britain ends up something better than the status quo by leaving the European Union go\nSo you couldn't get them to better themselves crow and so the only thing left to something worse in the status quo\nWho in their right mind would want that but that's in effectively what they've bought they're stuck with and then you need a political it's hard to say let's make it the least worse than the status quo it could possibly be less let's limit the self harm\nThat as much as we possibly can and I'm so that we saw the whole thing doesn't go crazy and maybe down the road we're we're in a position to to to to to rethink of [noise] um my deep deep worry is that nobody is exerting tomorrow\nIs the moral imperative actually stomach I'm saying you may have me for this you might think I'm a traitor you might think I'm week", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "16"}
