broad consensus among scholars and the invention of agriculture and of more subtle specialized societies and\nCreated an opportunity for men they pushed for these more distinct gender roles and sees for themselves the rules that carry most of the power especially political and economic power\nBut before we leave deep time I had one more question for Mac cocky and O'Connor and that was why did the patriarchy happen\nYou mean what was the motive why did the men of ten thousand years ago [noise] want to see the upper hand at the expense of the women in their lives yeah I mean what a jerk move to jerk move you all up and making ever since\nAnd here's how ... answer the why question\nPeople will argue that men need to tell themselves or want to be in charge because they are left out of the whole reproductive process really in terms of being the ones\nThat can create life and and uh even if people are informed that can't happen without their sperm nonetheless it's a huge cultural difference in in in many societies the creation and perpetuation of life is a really big deal right [laughter] so\nRight so guys have insecure egos well and they cause of what his amazing thing that women can do that they can't do that and we can't do and then that makes us want to run for Congress that [laughter] right\nAnd then you can think you can control the women's bodies by you know indoor thing anti abortion laws anyway I'm\nMargaret Mead came up with this concept of envy as an answer to that to Fred's concept the penis envy is much better than he did was to me\n[noise]\nBut even though Mel ... thanks womb envy is real he says there's the simple reason men built the gender hierarchy and put themselves in the top spot\nThe most basic explanation for why no supremacy here after\nHe arrived Barton ... ... men controlled women as well as for them because they're good and\nAnd so it's about power and really nice\nThat scholars say after patriarchy developed the first societies to settle down and farm\nThose cultures became the first colonial powers and they spread systems of patriarchy to the places they colonized\nQuestion though about this room in the idea in our society today\nI don't really see a lot of reverence for motherhood or fatherhood for that matter the U.S is practically alone among rich countries and not guaranteeing paid parental leave or help with early childcare we'll pay childcare workers a living wage\nThere are rampant reports of pregnancy discrimination women not getting jobs were losing them because they got pregnant\nAnd really even in terms of attitudes\nDo you really think the typical man in our society is in all of women's ability to give birth or do you most guys kind of see it as mundane no big deal something you're quite happy to leave to women\nNo I I I take your point I I don't think our society socialize as us to truly hold motherhood in high esteem\nExcept on Mother's Day if that [laughter] but but there is evidence that uh if we are talking about how we got this thing you know maybe the original motives for patriarchy there is evidence that that was different in at least some hunter gatherer societies\nMel ... told me about cultures in which the husbands of pregnant women eat plants that make them constipated so when the woman goes into labor the the the had goes out into the Bush and struggles in strange to push out heroic poop\nAnd then he comes back and reports that he gave birth to a stillborn baby wow so it seems like some kind of indication that those guys want in on the drama and the glory of of childbirth\nMaybe the equivalent in our culture is that you know is the high cost guy who pointed as partners pregnant belly and says look what I did\nAnd you know I Want to pick up on something else um make cocky talked about controlling women's bodies and that is really\nA huge part of what male supremacy is about for me men want access to women's bodies they want to control women's sexuality and our production of babies power and control isn't that another piece of the puzzle at least as important as we'll Mindy\nWell here's how ... put it he says a lot of what has happened in human history over the last ten thousand years is about men's desire to control uterus is let me bring in one more expert here Lisa weighed she's a sociologist at occidental college in California\nFor example controlling linens sexual behavior and wasn't there wasn't a lot of reason to do that when men weren't really interested in being able to pass down their stuff to their own biological child if they didn't own a bunch of stuff there was no real passing down to do and from what we know\nA hunter gatherers even if they understood the biology of reproduction they didn't really prioritize biological father of it so much as I understand that we are a big kin group and everyone is just helping each other raise all of these children which are ours right\nBut when people started accumulating stuff land and other property and men were building these patriarchal conspiracies or smell ... put it men decided it was important to know they'd be passing their property down to their biological children OK well their sons\nAnd men started to think of women as property to property they could trade by way of marriage for land or some other financial alliance with another patriarch property that could be damaged as an act of war property that had no more legal rights than a chair or a table\n[noise] and most cultures across the world that state of affairs has left thousands gender hierarchy with men firmly in charge and women having few if any writing\nThe women have pushed back with real but limited success in the last century or two [noise]\nAfter the break we jump ahead to about three hundred years ago in Europe and North America when things really\nCould have changed they should have changed but they didn't [noise] so they deny her [noise]\nAnd I see this as a door slamming shut for winning [noise]\nThis program has drawn from a season long series on\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bike has a gym presenting miss Saigon a new

dominance from the scene on radio podcast NPR acts on John be when\nAnd I'm Celeste Headlee and this special we're looking at the history of patriarchy where it came from in the first place and why it's lasted so long\nSo I'm ... what do you want to know about so one section is gender and science this section as colonial science a\nProfessor ... of Stanford University is showing our producer her library at her home in the bay area eventually she gets to a frame to document on the wall says this is the\nPage from ... diary this is the comment that she discovered the photocopy page represents shaping our own important\nDiscovery early in her career as an historian she found a page in Paris in the astronomical\nNotebooks of a German couple we often think of women coming into science has the twentieth century phenomenon but really women where scientists and very good scientists in the seventeenth Eighteenth century as well so Maria ... is an interesting story [laughter]\nBut eventually after two years the academy decides that is a woman was there is drawn him or people would laugh you know this is actually\nWhat they say they were a young academy at the time the Paris was where the scientific action was not in Berlin they were looking for his date isn't prestige and they were worried that a woman would destroy that status in ... so they deny her oh\nAnd I see this as a door slamming shut and for women is Maria ... had been the astronomer of the academy in Seventeen ten it may have been that women would have followed that this would have opened the\nDoor to the regular participation of women in astronomy\n[noise]\n[noise] so and she says in her research she found it in the early Seventeen hundred about ten percent of astronomers in Germany for women almost three hundred years later when she was writing your book and the percentage was lower\nThat is incredible looking back we might think it was inevitable of course Murray of income on didn't get that job of course male dominance would prevail for several more centuries it seemed like a given because we know at the end of that story right but she seems to be saying he could have gone the other way\nYeah what happened to Maria van come on just looks like a power play by the man in charge of the Berlin academy right she deserves the job she was already in the job and in fact a few years after rejecting her for the position\nThey gave it to her son was Maria as her son's quote unquote assistant justice she'd been her husband's assistance\nSo the academy retained her services anyway as one of their inhouse astronomers they just weren't\nGoing to give the title to a woman just because that just was not done right but that kind of blatant exclusion was potentially going to get more problematic as you moved further into the Seventeen hundreds and enlightenment ideas really took hold\nRight for many centuries it had been enough to say that women are subordinate to man based on the theory of humorous or on interpretations of the Bible but by the Seventeen hundreds those notions just weren't holding up anymore and societies newly interested in actual evidence\nAnd not only that this was the enlightenment and people were embracing the idea that all people were born with God given in alien ... writes an Englishman John Locke formulation in the sixteen hundreds we all have a natural right to life liberty and property\nThese ideas are creating new complications for the racist and sexist societies on both sides of the Atlantic says longest she dinner\nNow if you wanted to not give rights to women or two African slaves or to others in the society you had to\nExplain from nature why they are not equal so mad at me so the study of the female and the male body takes center stage\n[noise] okay so John tell us more and then we'll talk on the other side\n[noise] All right we assume a lot of ... says what plays out in the mid seventies hundreds is what she calls a war over skeletons scientific illustrators were making the first detailed drawing a female skeleton and even though this was supposed to be pure\nScience the drawings were politically loaded the two that became the most influential were drawn by a German man Sammy ... a French woman Genevieve dark and the and the story isn't going to go the way you might expect\nShe says both drawings had problems with the one by the French woman was the more sexist of the to\nThe German man portrays the female skull as large the French woman portrays the female skull as smaller and she portrays the powerless\nAs very very large and roomy very large in proportion to the rest of the body and it was just all in the pelvis that became the site of political debate\nTo make this clear madam dark and view didn't just happen to choose a model skeleton with a smallish head abroad pelvis her drawing was out of proportion with any normal woman\nWomen's skills are slightly larger than men in proportion

anatomy is a scientific foundation to the exclusion of women and on top of that is layered a lot of ideology\nAnd instead of if you take liberal philosophy that men and women should be equal\nThere was developed this theory of complement charity and that's the idea that men and women complement each other they aren't the equals of each other but they are the natural complement and this again shows that men should\nBelong to the public sphere of science and the professions and the state and women should belong to the private sphere of the home and children of the loving and nurturing private life\nThis appeal to anatomy and help the patriarchal thinkers\nWhen their argument over the egalitarian that argument was real even though in a male dominated society and the battle took

and continuity it takes enormous labor to keep reproducing then and there were only there were always moments when things went differently could have gone differently and then there's backlash oh\nWomen like Mary Wellstone craft called for women's rights in the late Eighteen century but before her there were prominent men\n... who we heard from the top of the episode and other leading enlightenment thinkers like fall quarter say lock in life and it's all argued with varying degrees of passion for the equality of the sexes\nYes yes men are often wonderful feminist\nOn the other side
