book white working class overcoming ... in America Joan welcome to hit and bright\nDelighted to be here\nWe've heard a lot about the white working class since the twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then that topped the professional manager elite is the top twenty percent by household income\nOn and I had to find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\n... group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle the middle of fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that stick group it's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some talking statistics about wages in this middle group over the last half century or what's happened to them economically uh starting let's say Nineteen Seventy\n[noise] since Nineteen Seventy the wages and economic prospects of this group had absolutely tanked I'm actually more recent statistics have come out since the book and the most dramatic is that virtually all Americans born in the Nineteen forties\n\nJones says new color families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her she told me a personal\nStory about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she worked at a daycare that serve low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with farmers are mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the the shoes in head start teaching and at the head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her in daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug sex rock and\nRoll um didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] Mm\nSays working class people have come to a few but government benefits and government programs are not for them\nSponsorship of the cake you read the lives dream bike Kennedy from Comcast with X vanity customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X Kennedy on demand\nJustice to her mother in law actually apply for some help her reaction was striking [noise]\nMade her reaction was oh I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us they just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they\nDeliver it to help and they were quite efficiently but it was that was not her some ... and you know it isn't her job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the programs and all the political elite\nTo make sure that Americans know that and they had seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book\nYou let the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and the outlook and people who are not\nHow's it going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to that community in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who are costs will politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same\nTies are the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it end Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of our GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted both for ... and for Trump where those people who were left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people\nWho have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to the work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange does your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes the it's a it's a form of social display but it's also a form of saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\nWork is what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by\nTheir jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie\nI'm just total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\nRight\nAnd\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many residue people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out in the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nGoing to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course college debt is what ... I'm In recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college on many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical schools will record and one\nFrom an elite family in one from a a a white working class family that white working class family has a kid has to actually be about three times as good as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jong says researchers sent out two sets of resumes\nThey're in one study Jones says researchers sent out two sets of resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the others and off in these signals water polo classical music on Mr water polo sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of this\nDebt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway [noise]\nDrug Williams argues that these class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in politics when we come back we'll explore different theories about why the white working class tip the twenty sixteen presidential election Donald Trump\nBam\nShankar based on them and you're listening to hidden brain [noise]\nThis is NPR\nSupport for K.

Smith says that Trump was in trying to attract all voters across the United states he knew exactly what demographic and what base he was speaking to and so again with these kinds of\nEmotional appeals that are tied to a specific group of individual\nThat pitch that message resonated as we all know now extremely well with his supporters and I think it was compounded also by the fact that we had eight years in Obama presidency and so it's immigration\nAlso tied in with the issue of race and this is why the subtitle of our book is immigration race and politics because the two things they at least in the context of the United states they go hand in hand with one another and so you have eight years\nOf the presidency of the first African American person in this country coupled with\nAt the Pacific campaign message of immigration [noise] ah altogether tiny in a lot of that racial resentment that happened in the past eight years I think it just is what galvanized his campaign and his presidency\nSo one wonders chopping application from your thesis Morris says we're heading to a situation where we have different political parties for people of color at people who are white and increasingly what this means is that our political devised become racial divide\nIndeed and that's one of the ah again more pessimistic outcomes of this research is that really\nYou know race as we all know is such a fundamental cleavage in our society [noise] but I think also Republicans willingly took on that strategy and are using it to their advantage clearly [noise] there's an interesting\nTension here it seems to me for both the Democratic party and the Republican Party you know we alluded to there's some time earlier but what might be the interest of each party in the short term might not be an interest in the long term can can you talk about that from the point of view of both the Democratic party and the Republican Party\nShore I mean for the Republican Party right now they are overwhelmingly white party and as we know with the way demographics are shifting in the United states we're going to become increasingly\nA majority minority country that at some point that strategy is going to be short lived right so but again for the time being for the next five to ten years it works so I I I think there are sensors well let's just go with it right they're not looking further beyond\nTwenty Thirty years from now on the other hand the problem that Democrats face there's yes they're the most diverse party that more diverse than Republican but one thing that they really are struggling with is that the voting behavior of voters of color different is a sense that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29"}
