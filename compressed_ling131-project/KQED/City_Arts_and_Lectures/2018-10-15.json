coincidence is anchored listened for hours to stories about them but what is it that is so fascinating about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley thinks he might have one answer he's the author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how they think about two incidents as I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to your first\nAt least book exam and how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise] this is a remarkably useful skill let me sometimes miss apply it\nWe sometimes attribute intention allergy to things that aren't even living especially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day but we give hurricane's name Katrina Sandy Andrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina\nThe mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America [noise] this isn't new\nFor centuries people have described intention ... natural forces [noise] we think's charms Johnson earthquakes must have a mind to stay around\nThis general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or\nOr meaning is often quite a successful thing to do turns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people\nIt's a good way to learn about each other is a good way to explain why are the people did something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of something\nThat doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random events some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have in mind behind\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable\nBut you couldn't anticipates its actions\nThat's when people described it or reported that it had more mental state they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has been tensions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance of billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls off and that predicted direction or you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain in these cases sometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe\nLook to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there is a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute a mind or something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain what's going on\nIn this uh autonomous in this autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an age of behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set the\nThere's underwater Roomba for the lack of a better term to the bottom of the pools are the rules around the bottom of the pool and it goes into completely random fashion rights or just runs a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and\nI find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next makes it just more interesting and more allow even away then something that moves in a very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well\nNow it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly start to get a little sense of a mind that people are crazy you don't you don't think it's like your mother writer or your your your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming\nOr the living room but it starts to look just a little bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people\nActually do name that room but as you can buy outfits to address it up\nOr if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of\nPeople thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nI Want to talk to you that have been about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stop and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happens was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of ... different kinds of causal structures you might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise]\nThis is what underwater room does have to do with coincidence is like a robot that does something unexpected coincidence this crowd from meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we talked to seek patterns even when there aren't any\nMaybe even beneficial a sign of good self esteem\nBut there are times when falling in love with ourselves all the people who reminds us of our cells can be a real problem [noise] retina elements a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland He studied something called implicit ecosystem\nWhich is the idea that many biased things are unconscious and one very well studied bias was he gets ... value in the cell favorably protecting yourself and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there's several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nSo we originally looked at whether people named tennis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great director ease of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper and they're now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer\nGravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brecht looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names for the recently released Nineteen forty cents is to examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as butchers miners workings minor masons workings makes them so we looked at every surname there is a currently at the top two thousand surname that happens to be a career name\nAnd we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forty cents us with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carved into probably originated from families who were in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both of names and the choices quite\nPossibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations there's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance that you did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality\nYou're talking about a a probability of less than more than a thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter Marin County farmer for example that that's really it it really just can't account for and in fact anywhere near this magnitude\n\n\nRent them as looked at large data sets and public records check the Social Security death index or state marriage\nRecords databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects\nLike for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different ... this isn't as on communist you might think beyond what you might expect by me a chance\nAnd there's about seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them just an eco terrorism as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shave for everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply the smaller effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nBrett says that if you really love your butt day the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so if you got married on the thirteenth of the month you are quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen has his birthday\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for reasons you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with them\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that uh and the the best bit of evidence I have that I'd never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle name you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's not what he's really in trouble and my additional count as if he might be a serial killer Sunday right in the middle name is not nearly as loved us the first started last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we just\nSomething about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was ... my name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as a dancer and I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of me down there to be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy I thought was just charming but\nNow as I'm listening to you said this I'm realizing that this could just be impressed that he can read his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in your jak decision\nAt the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself in a city criticism is affecting we're getting a little personal here but uh I\nI I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic examples that my son Matthew I'm his his last things Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lessons Pelham and I entered a relationship with her before I developed this\nNot after I developed a theory to validate the so your pal them and you got into a relationship with a woman named polling Poland and we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have to think that I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um\nDifferent religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nAnd it worse yet she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter]\nI said I understand why you would sort of called is charming and I think if you do this work for a while\nThere is a certain smiled at comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see\nYou are you understand sort of the choices that human beings me but I Do think there's something just talking about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last ten years I have the sense that my choices that deliberate choices that I thought about that my ... and making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they have these\nHidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself and he's a disturbing idea\nIt a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I do what you said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias or implicit he gets as I'm so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings but I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough with the idea that I have to\nAdmit that I really never know for sure exactly why I did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea but I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know why why do what I Do I mean there's just too much research ... much of what you've documented in reporting on\nThat show that by these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully dried us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began to study it the Serbian as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n[noise]\nSomehow you're wondering how does any of this matter [noise] who cares if people go on to the twenty third of September married those born on the twenty third of July [noise]\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet gravitates to what's carpentry why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own\nThat at least raise is tough questions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it suggests that very important decisions\nHave at least a little nudging influence\nUm based on things that you're completely unaware of so people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number that's not an objectively great reason to get married you should get married because you shared values you're both Republicans you're both rabid Marxist\nBut learning that the subtle little influences can affect what you do a\nApparently to some people ... I find it delightful but some people might find it pretty threatening I don't think that it proves that there is no such things free well but it's to me it does suggest that we don't always have free will sometimes we make a decision\nFor one reason that we told ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could have never put our fingers on\nAnd this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your birthday in general we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us and that can be a big problem\nAbsolutely I Do a little bit of research on social justice and that's one of the things that concerns me most is that we tend to focus on people who are more like us who speak our language who speaker idiom", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "15"}
