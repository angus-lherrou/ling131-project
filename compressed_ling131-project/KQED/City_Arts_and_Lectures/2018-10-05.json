learning about nonviolence he always pointed back and said that it was his mother\nAnd the practices of his mother she would uh at that time would try to prepare meals for homeless people in the community she would do try to do acts of charity and so forth\nAnd so from a very early age he says that he was a a brought up in the idea of service to people who were needy\nJose Antonio you mentioned to life altering encounters that say that China has had won with father Donald McDonald who was a parish priest in labor organizer\nAnd he said that he instigated says our love of reading and passion for non violence so one of the um individuals that say John met through the books was saint Francis has a ... seat\nWhen he finally met a father McDonald the idea was that\nHe was brought into kind of a formal education the kinds of practices that he had already been doing so learning about St Francis he started learning about what it means to deepen those practices of non violence and how that ties into the question about faith and the love of God\nA but it was something that he had already been living from an early childhood sort of his mother's practices or this kind of folk Mexican American Catholicism which was really really deep and his family\nIs there anything about St Francis a story that we might need to now to understand the connection to peace and non violence some don't know that story\nI I think that was something that was\nA really impactful for assess are about St Francis was the connections to a nature and to a animals in particular to St Francis always\nBelieved that it was important to in some sense right commune with nature and to think of nature as a living breathing whole system sort of pre kind of ecological consciousness and to think about\nNature as a being that we must be in a relationship with the animals are themselves sentient beings who have personalities in lives and thoughts that we can take into account in our own lives\nAnd I think that this impact obsessed starting to understanding and appreciation that nature is not just natural resources but it's something that we have to\nTake into account at something that nurses us that feeds us that is part of our own lives and bodies\nAnd uh I think quite frankly this probably affected his own decisions later on in life to become a vegetarian he was quite on her to a later on in life for 'em and for seizing that a peaceful nonviolent life means one about treating animals will and humane league various ways and so for him that meant that he had to become a vegetarian\nIt sounds like also that there was something about his readings at St Francis in hostile dining out really impacted him\nYou know I think that part of it was that he saw connection a much greater connection up from his own experiences to these other folks around the world he was able to see\nThis kind of idea of service to the least advantaged in society was something that was part of a much broader human experience from Gandhi and from reading the row\nHe was also able to see that this was a political practice and this was more than just about charity but it was about trying to

try to work for people that he felt were being ignored even by an organization like a this community services organizations so he he sort of fits this kind of a story of\nA of a self made man or the person who takes the risk and risks at all or to try to fulfill requests and the quest was working for the social justice of the farm workers\nAnd so he gave that all up in for about two years or so

Dutch that for ...\nLike was in some sense they're first effort to build solidarity or what was really unique about the the strike I think is the way in which was more than just a pure labor strikes\nBut it turned into a social movement turned into a rallying calls for Mexican Americans in California to see\nSolidarity between the farm workers and young Chicano since you got us in the cities and uh also with a lot of folks in other parts of the countries who started to see that the conditions under which farm workers were the struggling with and California and the people who are producing food that they were using\nWere abysmal and that they knew to a as consumers of the food to get on board\nSo what I think the ... represents is an attempt to try to expand I'm a labor struggles beyond that into real big social movements that involves students and consumers and intellectuals and the workers themselves into a movement for social justice well\nWhat we did again organizing up people and communities have far more good as it went from the former good towns all the way to New York city to Chicago to Canada or ten to ...\nAnd as a farmer because they would go to church you speak to people at church is speaking to a labor union of meetings that they had community organizations and just getting people to support and not by not that great but more than that we are organizing people too upset a picket lines in front of stars\nAnd when they would pick up the stores all of these volunteers that we came up to help us than uh the stores or take the grapes up so eventually we were able to get the major change a lot to take the greats out of all of their stores and uh then get people to stop by leaps altogether to became a huge moment and so we had millions of people\nLiterally all over the United states it stopped eating and not only the United states but also in Canada and Mexico and of course in Europe\nWhile I remember reading for me it was a very vivid picture of a shit ends in Chicago right in the middle of a store inside the store citizens and these were in the um big change\nSo that that really had to take a ... a bit of courage on the part of those who are participating\nYes it is in in many of those that were housewives where they were students that they were just people out there in the cities and they came forward to\nTo support the farmer cars but again we have to go back to the organizing part of it is it just isn't didn't happen farmers went out there and made this happen you know like I said by speaking and recruiting people getting people to his supporters on those picket lines so that was very exciting\nCould you take us through let's say an argument to or even one person who you were trying to convince not divide great someone who really couldn't understand what what would you say to them\nMost of the most part people are very sympathetic and in the message is simple you know we have farm workers are in California are on strike a an farmers don't have to listen to it feels they don't have drinking water and they don't have many protections for pesticides\nMore on this and all the episodes in our series on peacemaking a non violent conflict resolution dating back to two thousand two can be found at our website peace talks radio dot com that's peace talks radio dot com [noise] I'm Serious producer Paul Ingles would Carol boss who now speech was one of the many people inspired by the workers who is our job is\nWhen you have all this Cox grew up in a migrant farm working family in the Rio Grande valley in southern Texas\nHer father came to us from Mexico as part of the ... program which allow Mexican born workers to interview us work under contract to harvest for sure growers\nShe hears shell started working in the fields in the late Nineteen fifties dreams just about ten years old\nMeaning school for maybe six months out of the year and then and then having to drop out of school to go up north to states like Michigan where we harvest it a lot of a charity\nTo Ohio where we did a a a harvest it be lots and lots of tomato to New Mexico traveling most of the summer following the different crops so that we could then come back with a little bit of money and my dad would uh he bought like a one room house but then every time we would go up north would come back\nAnd that another room to the house until we had you know a two or three bedroom home and that's mainly the life as many of the eye of the migrants that's how it was it was it was my dad and and his brothers and their family and all of us travelling\nAnd then coming back and try to catch up with a with the rest of the students you know with some of the ... we had missed while while up north working in the ... what was the beginning\nAnd I'm Wondering if your family ... Santa the organizing efforts\nMy mom and dad like many other farm workers joined the union in Nineteen Seventy nine when do not his Web ... is our ... and ... Ross\nWe're organizing this area so that farmworkers could have like you know toilets in the fields are safe drinking water would would ban the use of the shorthand the whole would um would have liked the minimum wage was at that time with like a dollar forty\nSo they joined in in uh in um in Seventy nine I think he was in February I still have his union\nMembership card and that's why I remember those days\nI Know there was a big convention that had happened there was that it was the first one\nThat's the one that's the very first one and it was fabulous yeah it was a momentous event yes it was it was it was hundreds of delegates is a very very first find work a convention ever in ... in South Texas A M and probably in the whole state of Texas\nWhen he does ... do you remember seeing ... thanks for the first time\nI was volunteering at the union I remember him tally now some of the things that needed to be done here so that we could win those changes so that we could make those changes and I remember telling them but we don't even have water and I couldn't on yeah 'cause we didn't have water yet and we ... we don't even have the streets and we don't have\nYou know all of the very basic necessities\nAnd him saying the sort of telling us well we know that talk to you it is it is it is your responsibility he says at the end of the day I could go back to California and who's going to live without water and who's gonna live without the page street so that the best can pick you up for school at the time maybe with it was like\nWow if he thinks we can do and what impressed me was him believing that it's farm workers I could do something really to have an impact on our lives he saw something in all of us before we saw it enough ourselves I don't know that sort of confusing better when I'm trying to say is that\nShe had face because he had worked for markets in California he knew the power that we could have and so when he did that when he told us that\nAnd not only one time but many times over about what we could do and then when we started to work on it and then we started to win and then we started to totally believe and set you know what\nHe stepped suddenly right it we helped ... this world we have a lot of power and we also need to have that respect\nTheir men many wonderful memories of changes that have been made but but they also have come through a lot of sacrifices some scars that remain you know and people's hearts and memories for um for a lifetime but it's something that has to be recognized by everyone is that\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October fifteenth MLA dot Stanford dot edu\nThat we work so that that lost that are now affected our um our respect that and that they are enforced\nHe talk briefly about the forces that moved you inspired you to do the work that you're doing for your organization now you're the executive director I Believe that some of the day\nWhich is ... now in cat out union as all the people yes in other words talked about ... in a sense you're carrying on the work of on stage are childish in United farm workers\nI think that you know that all of the valuable lessons not only from tests I didn't notice that from um the farm workers themselves\nWilling to take a risk and say things have got to beat their friends we've got to work towards a change in some of this last we've got to make life better\nFor our for our children are some of the at the same I mean a philosophy that sets out has cats still carries on it's part of our culture and the work that we do\nIs learning from from the work that they did learning and and respecting what they did to bring us up to this point and feeling a responsibility of making sure that that it is moved into the future\nThat while they're still remains\nA injustices in the field or in the communities that we've got to continue that work that they be that they start at\nThat is on their shoulders that we stand all of our programs here a little bit for example one of the big core value self help and we just believe that if you if we live the problem that we can be part of that solution\nBecause we know we we fail it and we are going to fail the impact of the change and therefore we've got to be involved\nThat's Juanita found is Cox who continues to look out for farm workers issues in the south Texas area where she grew up in the migrant farm working family in the Nineteen fifties and sixties\nWhat's interesting is that typically when you talk about nonviolence you have this kind of litany of heroes that are engaged in nonviolence where people will say oh you're Tolstoy throw Gandhi Martin Luther king and sometimes they'll mentioned traveling or the lord is worth uh but\nUh I think that China's a offers a a ... and his practice and and the way he talked about nine nonviolence was very very different from the way in which for instance Gandhi and Martin Luther king thought about the effectiveness of non violence\nMore now from Carol bosses conversation with Jose Antonio Roscoe Oregon State university professor answers our job is scholar\n[noise] God these non violence was based on this a sort of Hindu principal of ... a or a non violence\nAnd forgotten that meant that when you practice non violence it's an all encompassing world view about not harming another individual and so that means that you try to engage and not harming anyone mentally spiritually and physically\nAnd practically speaking that meant that when Gandhi would organize a protest or a demonstration when an act of civil disobedience he thought it was very important for the protesters to inform the authorities thoroughly about what they were planning to do\nSo uh there was pre notification of what was going to be going on how the protesters were going to be engaging civil disobedience so that there were no surprises\nThat there were no secrets and that everyone was above board but that they would know that civil disobedience was going to take place in for Gandhi this if you believe that this was important to be completely transparent\nIn your actions to those who you consider to be your opponents\nTravis was much different than that uh he believed I think what we might call more in a in a politics of disruption um tactics that would be disruptive to the status quo that would get tension going on\nA but we're not necessarily all above board so to speak so for instance during the grape strike the uh the farm workers engaged in what was called the longest lived or to go which translates to a a turtle plans\nUm and so what this meant practically was that farmworkers would a plan to work very slowly picking the grapes\nAnd is anyone who's ever uh worked in great part of us knows that the temperatures in the valley in California get very very hot and grapes are very very fragile and if they're not picked at the right time and the right way uh they can be essentially just useless uh uh for production\nAnd so what the farm workers would do would they would work very slowly and not I'm not harvest as quickly as necessary threatening to destroy\nA many growers harvests and the the temperature was to try to of course the worker the growers to come to contracts\nOr another tactic was something that they called somebody knows submarines in other words a because in many cases the the farm workers had been prohibited from picketing near the farm and near the growers are homes\nOr they didn't have any access to the workers in the fields or to try to organize and to join a union", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "05"}
