arguing for the motion please welcome David Hudson junior [noise]\nDavid welcome to intelligence where do you ask your professor of law at Vanderbilt you are the author co author co editor of more than forty books including let the students speak\nA history of the fight for free expression in American schools you're also First Amendment ombudsman for the Newseum Institute First Amendment center that is a lot of First Amendment going on in your life so what sparked your interests first and free speech John it was very personal I ordered a phrase in one of my high school classes\nA and was asked to leave got kicked out of class so that censorship incident is what inspired my interest in you know interesting All right well thanks very much for that insight into what got you going and can you tell us please who your partner\n[noise]\nA reminder of what's going on we're halfway through the opening round of U.S intelligence squared us debate on John Donne then we have for debaters two teams have to fighting it out over this motion trigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous you have heard the first to opening statements and now on to the third\nDebate in for the motion trigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous here is David how soon junior First Amendment scholar and law professor at Vanderbilt University ladies and gentlemen David Hudson\nSafe spaces that protect students from offensive or disagreeable speech are anathema to the first amendment and the freedom of expression that we all sacrosanct safe spaces infringe upon core fundamental First Amendment principles the first one is the so called marketplace of ideas\nIt's traced back to justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and his descending opinion an Abrams versus United States in Nineteen Nineteen\nWhen he wrote we may not realize the fighting face they have come to believe that the ultimate good desired is better reach three free trade in ideas\nThat the best test of thought is the freedom of thought to get itself accepted into the competition of the market and the United States Supreme court ... versus board of regents a Nineteen sixty seven proclaimed that the college classroom it's securely the marketplace of ideas\nIf you have a safe space than you are preventing certain ideas from entering the market place the second principle is the counter speech doctrine\nAbrams versus United States in Nineteen Nineteen\nWhen he wrote one minute realize and fighting face they have come to believe that the ultimate good desire does better reach three free trade in ideas\nThat the best tuft of thought is the freedom of thought to get itself accepted into the competition of the market and the United States Supreme court and Casey and versus board of regents in Nineteen sixty seven for claimed that the college classroom it's peculiar early the marketplace of ideas\nIf you have a safe space than you are preventing certain ideas from entering the marketplace the second principle is the counter speech doctrine and the counter speech doctrine essentially means that when we are confronted with harmful\nObnoxious and even repugnant speech our first response should not be to censor that speech but to counter it to show why it's wrong to come up with a better alternative\nThis theory is traced back to justice Louis Brandeis\nIn Whitney versus California Nineteen twenty seven he rode if there'll be time to expose the discussion the fall certain policies to avert the eagles by the processes of education the remedy to be applied is more speech not enforce fire what's\nThe problem was safe spaces\nIs it leads to the silence scene and suppression of speech we don't want that we want more speech the first amendment protects a great deal of offensive\nObnoxious and even Republicans speech the idea of shielding students from ideas contradicts that principle right we want to protect offensive\nAnd even disagreeable speech that's how we learn before fundamental First Amendment principle is that a lot of speeches in the eye of the beholder was offensive to some people may not be offensive to another person\nThat's why these safe spaces are dangerous\nSir Isaac Newton Copernicus Galloway oh they were all ridiculed ostracized when they first issued some of their theories if we had safe spaces\nWould we shut all those great thinkers down we want speech to enter the marketplace of ideas we want to counter negative speech were positive speech we want to protect even offensive a noxious and repugnant speech because that's the essence of who we are\nAnd that's the essence of education [noise]\nThey must have some emotion again\nTrigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous our final speaker on the opening round who will be speaking against the motion Michael rough president widely in university ladies and gentlemen Michael rough\n[noise] thank you [noise]\nThere are a lot of good ideas out here and I don't know if this is actually a marketplace or not but\nClearly they issue can be distorted so that it's easier to take a stand no one is really arguing that all students all the time said for protected against any disagreeable idea nobody has ever argue that it sort of not having\nThe idea of safe spaces originally and right after the second World War corporate America said you know one of the problems with the business world today is that people who work at my company are afraid to tell the truth\nI'm the president was and I bought to say what do you think of how I'm doing at Wesleyan and people say oh you're doing fine sir and you don't have to call me surge is going to be president rough\nActually tell me the truth so after the second World War some good social psychologist mostly from central Europe came along and said well we need here is a safe space afterwards they use they said we need a safe space where employers can say you know president rough you've got your head in the wrong direction\nAnd they could do that without fear of retaliation or attack\nThat was the definition of a safe space still works pretty well for me you can speak your mind without fear of retaliation or attack when I was a student at Wesleyan in the seventies\nIt was pretty normal for professors to come to class and coach Casey was pretty new wisely in those days they said well I'm a nerdy twenty eight year old I I Want to\nHave sex with someone who's Nineteen my students are available\nSo they use their powers of free expression to comment on students legs on their attire now he said I'm just exercising my professorial duties I care about that student\nWe need space so students can learn\nSo they can tolerate disagreement when I was a young professor at a school where they are almost no African Americans one of my best students in African American woman she would routinely have professors ask her about the black experience and the other students go up to her and say can I feel your hair\nDidn't mean any harm but she felt it was an on safe space\nNot because they were disagreeable I ... but because people were in treating her as a person\nWhen I start my philosophy and film class\nI said to my students tonight you're going to watch a film about genocide it's horrible next week you're going to watch a film about murder police officers brutally gunned down in the wrong guy sent to jail documentary the third week we're watching a film about child abuse\nAnd I tell them this if you can handle the genocide murder trials have used in the first three weeks of the semester but if you can't handle it it's not the core see when I tell them to jokingly and if you really love this stuff\nGet help because I Want them to say oh it's going to be hard but actually we're in this together we're supporting each other it's safe enough to disagree\nAnd what may not be so painful to me might be very painful to another kind of students who has a different kind of history so I urge you to vote against this motion that safe spaces are dangerous thank you Michael rough\nAnd that's the first round one of the facilities for us to be where our motion is\nWarnings safe spaces are dangerous that we move on\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it in for Mike Rowe dot com\nArguing that emotional harm is a real thing truly debilitating truly toxic and can be as disruptive to the safe learning environment\nDestructive to the process of learning almost as much as a punch in the nose that it can really ruined inability to exist and participate in the process of learning but it's a real saying emotional harm count so she's wanting to take though\nI agree that emotional harm Israel but that's where I think our harassment and discrimination laws come in I additional evidence for some are necessary it beneficial but that's where the focus should lie I think that's kind of safe space\nFor all the reasons that we've delineated is so malleable I just don't think this concept helps I mean we don't have to prove safe spaces are always dangerous if you think about what's classically dangerous that our society explosives firearms tornadoes there\nAlways dangerous but we know they can be dangerous and so therefore we classify them as dangerous I think we've set a lot to show that this idea of safe spaces can be\nDangerous to their ideas that an insult the examples that Michael refused to the black a woman in his class of people wanting to touch her hair made her feel he used the word literally unsafe do you not credit that students experience of feeling unsafe\nI think the word safety I might call it but it it definitely the notes\nThis question of physical safety and I think at lighting that and confusing that that line between being upset being offended affronted and being actually unsafe is on health I Do think it contributes to a a sense of victimization but I certainly think speech can cause harm if it really is the level of harassment then absolutely the university needs to step in\nSo we're talking in a sense about how much harm and then the example that that you're just gave us wanted to take that I have\nTo say the reason I disagree with that is because in my view them aloft discrimination in the law of harassment her really narrow\nThe kind of behavior you'd have to prove to actually make a case of harassment is extraordinary [noise] um and it's simply not it's not enough the whole idea of safe given semantics matters I guess but when we're talking about the safety we're talking about feeling like you belong\n\n\n[noise] dishes intelligent squared us I'm John Donvan we are in round two of this debate where our motion is trigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous now it's time for questions from the live audience in bands Canada\nMy name is Michael Blum and my question is addressed to the side opposing the motion are you actually saying that a classroom can be a safe space in the sense that a student would be completely free from criticism and that those that would level a criticism against an idea held by another student in the classroom could\nBe censored or that a student who makes a civil statement and tries to further debate but one student in the classes in some way emotionally upset in that case the student could be sanctioned because the classroom itself at the university is a safe space absolutely\nNot I mean I run a classroom everyday people disagree all the time that's part of the discourse that's part of the norm no one is suggesting that\nThere's this question of degree right and a lot of it seems to me the argument against safe spaces that argument that well if you go a little bit over the line extent you can't express any ideas that anyone disagrees with no with serious ... it's about\nWhat the line it's an everyday classroom teachers have to figure out the example from Chicago would that over the line right muttering about affirmative action simply when an African American students tries to speak that's not that she'll be court that should be stopped that has to be stuff that I Would say I want to move on to a more questions\nAh my name is Stacey my question is do you believe the cancers currently site inundated by aggressive in critical opinions that they are largely unsafe faces right now and is should we not maintaining our attention to widen sit and watch students have sons\nOr should you should take that one of the reasons why I so strongly do believe in states spaces is because I think it is impossible to make the entire campus entirely safe because a large censorship machine at that level is risky and very difficult to operate to me like I wouldn't want to be in charge of it\nSo why don't we need to work on that that is more about teaching\nIt is more intense silencing we need to learn to teach students who are saying things which frankly are offending other students\nWhy those other students might find it offensive and why that might be reasonable now some students are going to go and do it anyway right but I think most people are decent people most people don't want to hurt other people's feelings I Believe or rather and the educated function of the university rather indie silencing function but yes it's a problem David if college and\nUniversity campuses have a multitude of ideas that's a great thing to be celebrated its not to be feared\nWe want people with different arguments to come forth with their viewpoints that's the beauty of a college and university campus I mean think about when you went to college the device of topics right abortion affirmative action capital punishment\nOr immigration reform gun control if you've always kept the same view on all those issues then yeah let's go have some safe space speak coddled be thrown in a cocoon and live in an echo chamber that's not what we want in a free society\nWe want what is [noise] okay another question the far side there so it's kind of you ah yeah my name is ... she'll come as you can probably hear from my accent from a country without the first amendment actually without even the constitution the first place but we nonetheless treasure\nFree speech can you can find a ... he's a safe space and do people have rights notes to this\nWell let me let me I Want to take a just a last question because I think we have been kicking around the idea of what is the safe space and perhaps it's going to be unresolved the right not to listen you've been accused of actually arguing for that David\nIn the first amendment community we often talk about simply the first Amendment rights of the speaker but they're also First Amendment rights of the listener is the right to receive information ideas and was shut down the ideas when we damp and discourse we're infringing on the right to receive information and ideas as well\nDavid answer your question is of course you have a right not to listen in public I may have to put up with it but in spaces where I Want to be left alone and can be left alone of course I have a right not to listen and some don't comes to my door and knock centers I'm going to give you a twenty minute lecture on white supremacy\nI'm going to close that door any ID I don't want to hear right which is not to say that person does not have the first amendment right to participate in public discourse in public places but I don't have to listen to him even when they're speaking in a park I don't stop and listen\nBut that's fundamentally different than a safe space that shuts off ideas and the first place and yes you do have a right not to listen Justice John Marshall Holland referred to it directly in ... California when he said avert your eyes\nBut that's in public places that was in the LA county courthouse well a lot of college and university\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite Hooper micro of Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it in for Mike Rowe dot com\nDisagreement and you have the exchange of ideas what you do so within a border and that is different in classrooms than it is in the ... it's different in the chapel it's different Sunday Morning than it is when the Chappelle is used for something else and the idea that you couldn't segment the campus into some stations that are safe\nFor some students some of the time of ... that seems an ... okay I'd like to go okay I'd like to go for\nThe most compelling argument that I heard for the\nFor side is the side from the Gulf side which is how Mike Rounds has classroom which is to say well we're talking about it as a failure of leadership professors who are unable or unwilling to create that context and draw the red lines and say you're going to listen if you don't want to listen you have to leave because we're in the classroom\nI okay look so I understand I was to\nGo out I think we would all agree I think that it would be preferable if in classroom experience for professors to create an environment for a robust exchange of ideas but where everyone felt included that they were four members of that discussion\nThat that's much better handled by the teacher herself or himself and it is by a a dean or even a person okay let's go to another question\nThank you um the world is not a safe space and we survive by learning to make our own states basis so if we as young people have universities creating safe spaces for us how will we ever learn to carve out our own safe space in the world was a good question to us but it was [noise]\n\nWas [noise] I I think the answer is simple it's the problem is you have a hope\nThat you can retreat to the students do not because they're surrounded by the university at all times university says no you're out of luck what are you going to do it's a special circumstance campuses ... strange creatures because they are mixture of many many many different things and to treat them as a whole as if they're sort of generic I think is wrong\nUniversity in my view has absolute right to help students create safe spaces of the sort that when they're adults off campus enough control over their lives more people do for themselves but at the Capitol university should not make the entire campus a safe space no one is talking about the perfect idea response we have a son\nI mean I think that's it it's a bit of a confused argument because if it's their home twenty four seven and they need safety to be able to inhabit\nThat home inevitably that brings up the role of the institution in generating that safety which I think you agree with so it's not just a matter of what happens when the four of us gather in a room together or club meets it's really a larger question of what happens on campus I think this term\nSafety with a smelly ability and nebulous nests one person's safety being dangerous for another person the kinds of criticisms and attacks\nAnd perhaps undermining of emotional safety that can happen even at a close space just makes this term\nVery problematic and it leads to what you're talking about which is a sense on the part of the institution that they need to step in that students can't navigate this for themselves that they have to come in and inevitably you know they're coming in to suppress speech at the end it\nSort of safety is being pitted against speech and it opens the door to censorship so that's why this term can\nBe dangerous we don't have to prove it it's inherently dangerous we just have to prove that it can be dangerous\nMicro yeah lots of things that you can be dangerous that is true I I Do think we have to remember that these students\nAre well aware that when they graduate they'll have to make their own spaces they're well aware that in the United states today that they will be entering in a world where there'll be much less likely to interact with people who don't share their views there'll be answering the world is much more intensive inequality\nAny previous generation has seen for at least a hundred years\nThere'll be answering it a world of much greater segregation than we've seen in a long long time and the United states\nThey're well aware of the hostility of the world and so it seems to me that you know learning environment you're not censoring ideas you're trying to give people the power to consider ideas that are radical for them that challenge their present physicians they do so well feeling their full members of university community\nAnd that includes round two of his intelligence squared us debate where our motion is trigger
