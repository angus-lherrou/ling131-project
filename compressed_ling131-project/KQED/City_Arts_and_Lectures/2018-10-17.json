hit list of things that you think I'm a you know that role still for whatever reason maybe not 'cause it's a favorite or because you thought you did such good work necessarily but something that you just feel like\nI'm proud of that I'm you know or something I I made of something happened to me when I was playing that role\nWell something always happened to me when I was ... working you know I was working number one I'm at but I don't\nThink so it it was on my career was on\nI I was an offered a whole lot of things I didn't turn down a whole lot of things but um I was lucky enough that once I got into the motion picture business which took me a while I'm\nAt least one script would come to me um every year but\nIn most cases they they were something that I was glad to do but then there was some real ... like [noise]\nWhat was I thinking probably I was thinking I needed to earn some money so I had so I had to do it you know like beyond the site and then if you like that that you don't\nNo no no\nWell as you write in your wonderful book which I could not recommend more in ... new memoir which is a sensational book\nYou write about how digital flying not in a way got your branded as a TV I forget it only ran one season forth I'm flying on rent for three seasons so you've stumped for years about kind of work and it\nTook awhile for some folks to say oh she's not just applying digital I mean she can do is\nYou know in my heart ... so [laughter]\nUm [laughter] no and I\nUm actually I did three sitcoms series starting three TV series by the time I was twenty five yeah so I was really you know indelibly on they do not call us we'll call you left and right up at\nAnd I'm certainly it in pieces the\nWhen the book and the reason I even talk about those\nI'm curious at my life and that was that the movement of my career um it is because I needed to look at my own a habitual\nPatterns my own handed down um history that has taken me a lifetime to understand and the beginnings of my work and my career worth so much a part of\nMe becoming I'm not an actor but me\nWell I mean it's interesting that a lot of the book I mean why this is not just the standard showbiz memoir a lot of the book is devoted to those early years because as you just as you say it's really it's a it's a coming of age or it's a it's a personal evolution story as much as it is a you know\nA a show business more really is not that at all and and we were talking a bit for 'em you set out to write this book not really knowing where it was going to start writing what six seven years ago yeah\n... it took me seven years and I I wrote it without really having a notion or a clear idea that I was going to publish it or that I Would have the guts\nTo publish it um I voted for myself because I needed to find out something that I didn't know and um I\nI I think I had been noodle ing with it you know evolved thing with that for ... for a long time because I was always picking writing classes at you know you at UCLA Extension\nOr I'm going to a writer's workshops over like during the weekends and writing things in in little snippets of this would come flying out of of my head but when my mother passed away\nI felt an urgency to find something that I didn't know where it was I didn't I thought I'd done over things that we're supposed to do I have the conversations we heal the wounds if there were any what's done we did such a good job\nSomething was deeply disquieting and it wasn't that I was just grieving\nThat too but it was that something was festering on me and I had to I had to\nPull out all of the pieces and lay him on the table and put them together and see if I could understand a story that he didn't\nKnow before and and and to do that I had to learn the craft because it was in learning the craft of acting that I was really able to find pieces of myself and\n... ... ... one of the things I'm really glad we're able to include is and I'm Glad I got some flaws in ... the uh the mini series you did in back in Nineteen Seventy six and you say in the ... more of that that was the first time you had a glimpse of what it meant to be inside a character\nAnd you said there's actually a line and civil about that character being pieces it's multi it's of multiple personality story someone if you talk a little bit about that moment of how that started to maybe open you up both as an actor and as a person as well\n[noise] well let's see how far back I have to take you back some um my childhood was complicated to say the least and I had developed a kind of mechanism a kind of survival mechanism that\nI kind of mechanism kind of survival mechanism that um when when things\nGot too overwhelming to me I since pieces of myself that were overwhelmed with emotion and with you know things I didn't understand I sent them\nWell I read in the bed in the book I Would send it outside the tree that I can see it get to see this tree outside the window and titles that were very dangerous and frightening to me as a child eight nine ten eleven twelve and I can ... I Would watch this tree and it was ... it was a sycamore and the leaves would reflect sounded like rushing water\nAnd part of me would be in the room and most of me was out there\nSo I developed this and it wasn't that I was civil I wasn't but I didn't the only time I could feel all connected with all of the parts of myself was when I found a stage when I was twelve years old and\nThe of the perfect place if perhaps you know perhaps I'll perhaps um\nAnd then my stepfather came and I had turned down this series I didn't want to do it I mean it was Nineteen sixty six\nEverybody was running around naked and eating ... [laughter]\nI didn't want to be dressed as a ... [noise]\nWant to be running around naked but I didn't want to be just as a no neither do the halfway to position [laughter] so I I I\nTurned it down and turned it down and my step father came over and said if I if I didn't do it um they had called him and if I didn't do it might never work again\n... ... and I went oh really\nAnd I got scared so\nSponsorship of the kick you read the live stream by super micro Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nSo defeated from day one I uh I ... I started\nTo be very depressed I didn't know that it was I was depressed because in Nineteen sixty six I didn't know what depression was um\nAnd maybe I maybe I Would have been all of this would have been bubbling up anyway because I'm becoming a young adult and whatever complicated childhood I had was confusing me and just coming out I don't know\nBut it ... it manifest itself and in eating disorders and um [noise] you know just then I then I then\nI went to a doctor and he put me on diets pills because of that at the time they could do that and they were like this big just straight Dexedrine okay now we're\nEverybody thought whoa\nWhy did somebody tell me about that\nBut then when I hands were shaking so bad in a scene that I couldn't lift up a cup of tea in the scene because I looked like I was really not doing well I and I found myself drinking a cup of tea holding a saucer and the cops together\n[noise] and the the nuns were going that's an interesting way of doing that so I\nWas always something that stepped in and stopped me from going down these and you know and so\nOne day towards the end of the first year I'm just trying to charge through this\nAnd all of a sudden I'm standing in the mother superior to office and all the other nuns around one of those normal scenes and all the ... nuns around and we're talking about now [laughter]\n[laughter] ah [noise]\nAll of a sudden\nI put my hands in my face and I just sold it I just pulled it up\nAnd in in my head down in my lab\nI started whispering please let me go home please let me go home please let me go home\nAnd he kept trying trying to stop and voice inside and I had to get I get up get up just pop up and go well\nI don't know what that was it was weird [laughter] I\nCouldn't do it I couldn't make myself get up I just sat there and say see certainly go home please let me go home\nAnd all of a sudden I felt this arm on the hand you know pull up my arm not not like he was trying to pull me\nI'm pull my hands away or you know tried to talk to me it was it was kind\nOf a support like pulling me up and I heard this voice not loud but a voice that you didn't argue with say get her car she finished the day and it was Madeline sure with the mother superior and and she\nShe led me I had my hands to my face 'cause I was too embarrassed and to see how horrified everybody must have been um ...\nAnd she let me towards the big sliding doors that open to the sound stage and I could hear the honk honk is the thing rolled open\nAnd and she\nPushed my head down I got him some vehicle that I never I never looked at the driver all the way home I was to mortified and then he took me home and I I think I was home the next day I come to work like\nEverybody how are you off you know everything's fine\nThey just ate that hotdog I should\nOf you know and it and then towards the end of that day Madeline pulled me into the back\nI'm into a dark corner in the corner and the sound stage and stuffed a piece of paper\nIn my hand and she said the address is very close and you can you can come to the day after work\nI Will meet you there it's the actors studio ... do you know what it is and I said\nWell yeah you know\nThinking nah not so much that I really know what it was but I kind of heard about it\nAnd she said I Will not take no for an answer so I met her there\nAnd it was really um the beginning of a huge change in my life because\nI could then begin to hear myself again 'cause if I could get to the work I Would be All right it was when the work was taken away from me that I began to drown and um and then I started working at least offer very intensely and\nUm I desperately wanted to learn a craft and ...\nAnd ... she was quite taken with you he was it it seems like another you know of another\nProvidence who delivered you're going to but it didn't go that way with the stress where did it well it didn't it didn't\nLike he had it all planned out but um he was really a um a magnificent teacher but he could be a little rough\nHe could be rough and he could be ... you know what we would sit in there and watch other scenes and sometimes you know you you feel the other ... oh my God oh my God how to recover from that you know when when he would talk to some people and he from the get go\nWith me he was in credibly um supportive and um I went to ... you know as much as I could when I wasn't working and you know it was sort of known that I was one of his you know chosen ones or something and\nUm so I and I started eventually when the none was over I thank God I [laughter] I started I'm going to his ...\nWould sit in the ... and watch other scenes and sometimes you know you you feel the other ethical oh my God oh my God how to recover from that you know when when he would talk to some people\nAnd he from the get go\nWith me he was in credibly um supportive and um I went ... you know as much as I could when I wasn't working and you\nKnow it was sort of known that\nI was one of his you know chosen ones or something\nAnd um so I and I started eventually when the none was over I thank God\nI [laughter] I started\nI'm going to his then the ... Institute was he had and he and his wife and I had started so that I could work with him more intensely I think it was three times a week they were um just\nHim teaching and doing um exercise extended exercises with just with Lee and and it was an extraordinary time and then one day as\nI'm also so striving to move my career on because it's going nowhere unless I make it go somewhere and I told myself that I could never blame the them the them\nThe industry the the the unfairness of it all the votes or something it it could never do that if I wasn't where I wanted to be it had to be because I wasn't good\nEnough and that's when I got good enough\nThat would just change and it was just you know\nShe forward so slowly and one day I was doing a scene I'm friendly at the Institute and you were supposed to um\nBe generous enough to win another actor asked you to be in a scene with them even though it was something you did not want to do in a million ... million years you just did it anyway and did your best because you were supposed to participate\nWith your fellow students and I had done that with them and not just to to ask me to to play in a in a two character play called a whore the player I think it is and of course I was not the whore [noise]\nI was it was supposed to be like two sides of the same person\nUm and one of them was like the Marilyn Monroe ish character and one of them was the none\nIssue carrots [noise] gas which one she wanted me to fight [noise] and so automatically I\nDidn't want to do it but I Try you know I was you know going to do the best they could and but it was about but I wasn't\nReally taking it seriously and I and by then I was kind of hockey I was kind of share of myself with sleep well you know\nJust going to do a little fancy footwork chair and a little you know a fair and I'll be\nJust you know that's all everybody with that and I'm\nLee first talk to um the my cello um after\nAnd he seems very kind and the ... when you work at the actors studio what you after you do a senior supposed to say you know when ... or ... or whoever the moderator is you're supposed to talk about what you were working on because it's never finished product it's always a work in progress\nSeveral emotions strong emotions are happening at the same time\nI'm like for instance with my stepfather and needed his love and affection he was magical even bigger than life and my real father ignored me and he my stepfather\nJust didn't turn in was affectionate and so as a child I needed that kind of affection but I felt terrified\nAnd so danger was always connected with love for me it was a stunt man he was literally arrest federal yes so\nYou know it's taken it takes me it's taken me a lifetime to figure out\nHow I can just connect those two because wait a minute that's just\nThose two don't really go together Sally can still have a relationship with somebody and not feel in danger on the line\nWhile the other big figure of course in this in this triangulation is your mother who and what she knew or didn't know during during the course of this and it had a very moving the way you write at the end about\nYou're coming to some accommodation was about that not necessarily a complete you it's not all sweetness and light what happens between your mother but you you you love your mother deeply an end of the complex way that the mothers and daughters sometimes is particularly when there's abuse happening I'm\nThe mother knew something but didn't know it all it's it's really quite um it's quite extraordinary and I just I Wonder if if as you were writing it did you know all of these things before you could I mean did you discover known from the writing\nBut I discovered in the writing I discovered so much and the writing and it was\nHard to do is hard to get a it was hard to move away from it it became you know addicted to it I'm ... and I I ... you know I Would have it in my pockets in my\nShoes they ... because I didn't want to be away from it and I'd be drawn a way to go to work and do other things which was probably\nA good idea and I come back and it would be sort of fresh but I I\nThe big ingredients the big things I was looking for I didn't discover so I made myself go back and look at it I made\nMyself read my journals that I hadn't written something I had written a very key thing\nIn my journal um you know only like Fifteen Years\nPrior to this and I wrote it down\nI wrote it down and completely\nWiped it from my brain\nAnd yet something in me knew I needed to write it down and it was only in doing this then it went wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait one\nMinute and went and found a journal and went and got when\nOh my God and could peace some things together that we're in pieces [laughter] um [noise] and I understand um and I think ultimately what I was looking for was\nWhat I felt about my mother\nUm I did not want to feel\nUm that she had left and ah um\nThat she wouldn't taught me first I needed to haunt me and then I I thought do I am I feeling angry\nI don't know and then ultimately I'm at the very end and when I done all of this for seven years and I was sitting with my youngest son Sam I'm who was the only one who I'd let read ... ... actually\nI Would read it to him as I was putting the last chapter trying to figure out what how it sit together\nAnd they said why did I Do all of this what is this about what did I learn at just something I've looked to something and I all the time and I still don't know what it was and he said\nOh my God do you see how different you are and then you were seven years ago how differently you feel about yourself\nAnd I went oh God\nYes you're right I Do and that really is the end of the book it's the last understanding of it that I write I'm about my mother and um I realized that they didn't need\nHer to haunt me uh I'm fine without her and that\nSomeday she will come and get me [noise]\nMe just switch gears all them ask you about some of the people that you've worked with a really useful you're close to what you mentioned Joanne Woodward and civil gas talk a little bit about what the uh\nOh you're close to what you mentioned Joanne Woodward and civil gas talk a little bit about what the I mean it's such a the two of us just to do whether or not yeah him and it's just really mark will tell me about working with with her on on the well\nShe's um and I was lucky enough to later work with her fence phenomenal husband Paul I mean\nThey were this this extraordinary couple she was so she was so\nEverything that I wanted to be um she was a real after that's really all she cared about she never cared about you know being famous or looking really pretty or she just one of the work getting into the work and she boy did she know how to work\nAnd she was just dead on and there was no there was no ego involved it was always about the scene\nAnd um I've been lucky enough to work with a few people like that\nBut um I think Joanne Joanne really was the first and um you know she just was one of the few people in my life really you know sit here take my hand and I got it and uh so I she just as a\nAs a gym now you you and ride leaving her grade in in one race really is a great or it's just a great you know the Jewish classic Jewish guy from New York and and and the character that you play\nThat there's ... chemistry is a sort of a cliche but there's something more than ... physics going on to do if you what what was it like working with with him on that\nHe was you know he's again a wonderful guy and a wonderful actor but I think the chemistry that you see between run and I it's really I'm already\nWritten by ... um and you know played through Ron I'm because ... was came into my life than he was such a huge influence in my life from then on um\n[noise] and so it's it's interesting um that\nHe's so um eat rats itself around a ... a performance and and um and a production but he's never eaten in different take over it or anything but\nI think the the\nEnron and I really loved working with each other but\nI was seeing Marty when I looked at Ron ... I'm not how I adored him\nWas was he the most influential director for you would you say\nI Would yes no absolutely no even though I've been lucky enough to work with some wonderful directors but he it was the role in and how we and how he um enabled me and he'd come from the actors\nStudio and and I'm the same way that you know they he he was close friends with Leon ... van and all that\nAnd he had a language that I understood and I didn't have to decipher his language to into my own I'm acting language and he thought the exactly the same acting language and so it was fun for us to to play chess games with each other and see if we get out maneuver each other you know and\nUm I don't know that I ever really quite\nAgain ... ...\nAh when linked to the hospital of Lincoln came up you that determination as you've been talking about really went into high gear you are determined to get that part in originally Liam Neeson was\nWas cast in the role and you went after you've really lobbying Spielberg that you wanted to play this role and it looked like it might slip out of your hands on by God you weren't going to let it happen right you are you sort of pretty much insisted alive for him [laughter] I'm\nDaniel Day Lewis of course famously you know stays in the character ... what was it like\nFor you working with a remarkable after it was a particular we'll\nSee I ... I Love that I mean that's perfect for me I left that\nUm I Would ... you know in my own little way um I always would stay in character but I Would always hide it because I never felt I had the power to be Daniel Day Lewis and to take over and say everybody's got to follow these rules you know and\nSo everybody follow the roads around ... character but he lives alone\nUm and you know and and and I and he's ... he's a phenomenal guy um but he he made it so that when we came on the set\nThere were no cruise around it was all set up so you didn't you didn't ever\n'em ramble in in in ... and and and feel the contemporary world around you you know the crew wasn't allowed to come up and said you see that television thing unless I never you were just in this world of the White House and um so and Daniel\nYou sort of demanded that he and Steven it's decided that and and\nUm that's what everybody else in the cast conform to the other day\nThey did a lot of a lot of actors\nWould complain they complained to me I don't think they combine to Daniel I go I can I can learn my tennis shoes on the staff at my feet are [laughter] you know [laughter] but\nJust loved it I mean that's there it is that ... that is the you know the the totality of it how deeply can you commit to this to being this other character and I love the fact that he does that what", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
