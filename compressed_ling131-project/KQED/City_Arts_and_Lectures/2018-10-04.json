Silicon Valley senior editor\nTonight kick you E D presents remarks in conversation that took place on September seven that Silicon Valley leadership groups and he will twenty eight team game changers summit\nEvent was held at the computer history museum in Mountain View and it was hosted by Silicon Valley leadership CEO Carl Gore dino four major challenges for the bay area region where topics for the game changers presentations and discussion\nThe need for affordable housing they need for better transportation systems and options for commuters the need for affordable health care and the desire for expertise and successes that are hallmarks of Silicon Valley to extend into many other regions of our country [noise]\nThe broadcast features San jose mayor Sam cardio in discussion about the need for more affordable housing with David chew chairman of the California Assembly housing committee\nExchanges followed by remarks from Sarah ... who was president and C. E. O. upset or health program closes with a conversation between Steve taste and Greg Becker case is the legendary founder of AOL who currently heads up revolution a venture capital firm\nBased in Washington DC Becker is president of Silicon Valley bank now here in San jose mayor Sam ... in conversation with California simply mean David chew with a discussion about housing in the bay area\nIt's a great pleasure mind to be on stage here with the chairman choose someone I admire so much a you know I became uniquely aware of our housing crisis\nWhen I heard the story of a young lawyer who is looking to rent an apartment in San Francisco and he couldn't find anything terribly affordable and so he ended up renting a pretty rundown apartment in the tender line\nAnd sure enough yet a classmate who was on the east coast got a job in San Francisco and my classmates couldn't find an affordable apartment either answer after a lot of searching eventually a classmate decided\nTo sleep\nOn the floor of the apartment of this young lawyer because there was no room for a couch\nNow\nI Know maybe you say this is not all that remarkable in twenty Eighteen we know well the housing crisis or certainly greater victims than the\nUh except that this is a story from Nineteen Ninety six and a young lawyer was me and the guy sleeping on the floor is now the chair of our assembly housing committee David show [noise]\n\nThe Morrow this story is that this housing crisis is not new it's just gotten worse right and we all know that and in the last twenty two years certainly a lot has changed\nAs this housing crisis has gotten worse or David is now dressing much better than he did in Nineteen Ninety picks up but we know the crisis is worse worse than despite the best intentions and best efforts of many and I can't say there have\nRecent years extraordinary efforts made in city from the local perspective obviously I'm the mayor of a city and we cared a lot of what's happening within our borders and as we know are overwhelmingly land use decisions are the function of cities and in their government\nAnd we've seen great progress in cities like San Francisco or leadership for mayor Lee aunt David True in two thousand Fifteen or that ... to three hundred and ten million dollar housing bonds\nOr in cities like Oakland reliving shop over the last two years is titled some Ninety seven hundred housing units are tremendous leadership\nIn our own city our own county of Santa Clara ... two years ago the leadership of our county board passing a nearly ... billion dollar housing measure and city of San jose several years\nWe led an effort to make San jose the largest city in the country with a city wide\nInclusion or housing policy that we announced last year initiative to build twenty five thousand homes in the next five years and this November or with a measure measure the\nFour hundred and fifty million dollar housing bonds which will be the largest housing bond of any city in the state of California in our history oh these are important and we know we need all these things to be successful it's all good now here's the rub\nNone of these efforts have these individual cities will suffice we know we're emerging from a half decade in which throughout Silicon Valley we've added jobs at a rape six times the rate which we added housing units\nAre we know that despite the best efforts of\nThe large cities in our region\nAnd by the way I should add some of the uh small midsize cities here in Mountain View I think they're making tremendous progress oh we're not going to house our bay area's population in just three cities and if you other towns that are willing to reach out and reach out\nWe know we're going to need all one hundred and one jurisdictions working together in this area for really going to tackle this housing crisis\nBecause of course land use is fundamentally a city function\nAnd we know that there are plenty of examples throughout our bay area a city that simply do not want to bury their responsibility for housing a rapidly growing population\nTo address the job growth that we have we have a name cities that for example where perhaps a three million square foot campus may have been built over a period of five years\nAnd in fact is zero housing units added to that city in that period of time that is not a solution I and there are many many others and so\nAs we grapple with this challenge or we know we need help\nFrom larger forces than just individual city and so I had reached out a to an old friend of mine who happens to be the chair of the housing committee and the assembly as we thought about how it is we can tackle this challenge in a more regional way\nHow can we ensure that all cities and towns in the bay area are varying responsibility for housing\nAre rapidly growing population and with that I give you two of the great chair of the assembly housing committee give it to [noise]\n\n\nGood morning [noise] so ah since San has doubted our uh our humble beginnings [noise] uh let me just share I thought it might make sense to share a few more details about what actually happened in Nineteen Ninety six [noise]\nSo in Nineteen Ninety six or we had been classmates than I had called them up I had just\nA received a a job offer in San Francisco and I needed a place to stay\nAnd uh he said why don't you crush with me for a few days while you figure it out and so I visited him a in his humble home it was an efficiency in a building or that the newspapers at the time referred to as being managed by a slum lord\nAnd uh he said welcome to my humble bowed or I don't have a couch but there is a comfortable floor at the foot of my bed [noise]\nAnd every night for that week we were woken up or I was walking up because Sam have gotten used to it at that time by uh the sounds of not just her neighbors but a police officers coming into the building or to make arrests\nAnd I told them a few days in a same I don't know how it is you managed to live here\nBut rather we gotta move [noise] and at the time in Nineteen Ninety six Ninety nine percent occupancy\nAnd ah we managed to find a place not too far away but uh on Russian Hill for those of you know my fair city of San Francisco a five of us ended up living in an apartment that was built for three\nSam lived um and this is not a joke he literally lived in a closet [noise] where are the the floor foot square foot of the closet was about the size of the bed that he slept in about three feet by hotel you Sam [laughter] six six something it was about six feet four inches\nAnd ah it turns out that uh several years later the landlord of this particular building was charged with criminal negligence these are All Facts [noise] um I share that because that was Nineteen Ninety six\nNinety nine percent occupancy rate that was before dot com one point oh before dot com to point no before the highest home prices the highest rent the highest levels of homelessness the highest infection rates dependent crisis that we're experiencing not just in San Francisco and San jose in Silicon valley\nBut the entire state of California and\nI share this uh because today two young men in their twenties who have an interest in coming to northern California to find their fortune to live their dreams just wouldn't be able to do it\nOkay you guys do know where you are\nLittle worried [laughter] I Know the traffic was bad but hopefully your guys ended up at the right place on\nGulf of innovation next transformed I wouldn't say not just this country but it's transformed the world\nSo hopefully\nThat same technology has transformed healthcare right so what type of relationship\nStatus was technology in health care [noise]\nIt's not good really it's not good\nSo if you think about other industries in general technology not it's not always but in general technology has made it\nEasier it's made it less expensive\nIt's made it more customized\nIt's often made it simpler\nI Would tell you that in general in healthcare\nTechnology has made it more expensive it's made it more complex\nAnd it's often made it more difficult actually\nFor\nThose who work inside of health care to do their jobs now why why is that\nUh we had a great panel I thought including or\nElected officials talking about the interplay of regulation\nAnd what they were trying to do in housing and in transportation we\nPut technology in health care\nOn top of laws that\nWere written not just before\nThere were smart phones before there were a flip phone sometimes before there were computers were full technology on top of a culture\nThat is incredibly wedded to credentialing and licensure\nAnd we put technology on top of a process\nThat gets at the very heart of what it means to be human and does it as a promise to make it absolutely better yes has it done so to date no it really hasn't done so today but there are\nExceptions and there are things that could work and there are things that are working now so what are a few examples of things where it's actually made it better\nUm\nThis is a screen shot of a an app I have on my phone how many using online\nApplication to have access to your medical records I Would hope every\nShould to have access to your medical records I Would hope every hand in this room would go up really I don't know how any of us got on\nAlong without it I can both an appointment with my physician I can get my lab results I can get prescriptions refilled I can send a message to my doctor All right things heal\nIsn't this game changing technology if you talk to our physicians they will tell you that this has changed everything if he talked to some patients they'll tell you this changed everything\nBut is this new technology now it's really not new technology this technology was around for a very long time before healthcare implemented it as a matter of fact I could track my UPS packages many years before I could track my lab results here's another thing we think this game changing and healthcare many or visit\n[noise] now\nMore than six years ago when my eldest daughter was applying to medical school and living in Switzerland we used to practice for her medical school interview\nSix years later I she's going to her training she goes to a lecture that says video visits are they here to stay what would we do with this new technology it's British slow so just\nHealthcare is really all about the people but do we make it enough about the people do we think about\nHow our technology is actually going to interact with the people we serve and the people who served those people what do we do about the chaos\nThat surround us for the most vulnerable among us let me tell you a story about this patient\nAnd this is Michael Michael had\nGotten a lot of health care\nA lot of very expensive health care he ended up our patient because he had recently been in another hospital and he was discharged with five different kinds of medication\nMichael left the hospital and took\nEvery pill and every bottle at once\nNow Michael did not do that because he was suicidal Michael did that because it could not read the instructions he was given\nHe was brought by ambulance to our emergency department where they saved his life for more than that they took the time to talk to him to discover that the problem was Michael needed a pair of reading glasses that you can get at a drug store to be able to read his discharge instructions\nWhich we happen to by actually from the dollar store in bulk so\nSometimes the solution is going to be a technological solution and sometimes the solution is going to be really about listening but it's all about what do we do to take the chaos is around health\nCare and organize it instead around the patient that\nIs the promise of an integrated health care system\nThat integrated health care system might be built a system like set our house where we actually bring together physicians nurses other care providers hospitals ambulatory settings in home care it might be built in a virtual way depending on what community living and how that community is served\nBut you gotta bring those things together because the complexity that his health care today is otherwise not going to work and has to be brought together in partnership in partnership with\nThe people from the panels we just heard because it's often about housing and it's often about transportation and it's often about social services and it's often about the environment and it's got to be brought together with the patient in the center because just like a marriage\nIs not about the wedding it's really about two people falling in love and making a commitment\nTransformation of health care needs technology is going to depend ON Technology but it's not going to be about technology is really going to be about health care and technology being supporting players so that we can do things with love and compassion for people who need us thank you\nYou're listening to a broadcast from the Silicon Valley leadership groups' annual game changers event held on September seven in Mountain View\nThe last speaker was Sarah ... president and C. E. O. upset her health\nI'm Tania mostly our final conversation tonight is moderated by Greg Becker president of Silicon Valley bank who introduces Steve Case the founder of AOL now heads revolution a venture capital firm based in Washington DC here's Greg Becker\nTo morning he goes all filled with is good for lunch everybody's still goes energy storage\nUm\nSo it's great to be here I'm Steve and thanks for joining us or the or when Carl and I were talking about who we can ... you know for a ... game changers event uh we immediately both tutors and inclusion of having you a bigger is like the perfect\nExample of being a game changer as\nWe were talking about his new drugs and you can look at what speed it as is the founder of AOL complete game changer would be his daughter revolution and really a game changer thinking about venture capital of entrepreneurship rise with the rest you're just a great role model for that so thanks again for for for the beer [noise]\nUm so I had the fortune of of being with Steve\nAnd his crew on the rise of the rest of the summer I went to a couple of cities or dollars and a\nMemphis and I'm One of the questions I wanted to ask Steve gonna to Europe\nUm this conversation was\nUm about\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature ban political science and into session will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Stanford ...\nNow how many people have read um the book or the third wave [laughter]\nAll right so a a I don't know maybe a third of that so\nI'm Judy advanced ... partners my first question Steve how hard was it to bring in a partner with a much better off than you were\nThe worst of the book came out about the same time two years ago and he has the hour is like one of the best sellers of the past decade several million copies to open minded not nearly as well but thank you so much greater pointing that out so great to be with their side and make me feel\nBad about my my one it took me six years the right one book and and you're already thrashing my publishing career [laughter] All right I'm really sorry so um\nI get is softball to start so I'm kind of one one question which is just getting some nail sketch of of the rise of the rest what it is and also the third the third wave and in why why it's important to you and why should why it's important to this audience\nWell first of all I should probably talk about the rise residence really promoting entrepreneurship outside of Silicon Valley\nThat simply doing like a Bloomberg data system\nOr for the trucking industry well guess what\nOf the big trucking companies are headquartered in Chattanooga\nWhat most of the big trucking companies are headquartered in Chattanooga\nSo if you like want to do as data system for the trucking industry those are like where the customers are those are people understand it kind of makes sense to be in in a in ... in Chattanooga in some of the things that are happening in health care particularly health tech\nA lot of these coming out of Baltimore Johns Hopkins is based there underarm are rich doing a lot of things around you know kind of fitness tax and so forth are based there is a lot of things happening there Cleveland because of the you know the the the Cleveland Clinic a lot of different parts of course\nThings are happening here in Stanford many other you know great places are are kind of sources of innovation but it's not just here to happening in these you know these other places so in in Michigan I'm\nReally ... back to a company that's selling a guy who simply space company in Traverse City Michigan a and there's another company we backed in Detroit started less than three years ago that was four hundred employees is doing\nTwo million dollars in revenue a day in downtown Detroit so ... you know these things are happening it just the story is not being told most people don't think\nThey're start ups in Detroit or Pittsburgh or or Indianapolis or other Indianapolis by the way up and you mentioned Indiana oh there's a company their colleagues that target acquired by sales force for nearly three billion dollars\nThey'd have two thousand employees in Indianapolis second largest office outside of San Francisco for sales force\nIs in Indianapolis most people think nothing's happening Indianapolis\nSo we're just trying to got to tell that story and and get more people particularly the money here\nAnd like he goes Willie Sutton bank bank robbery you when you when you brought the banks 'cause that's where the money is a you know I feel a little bit like Willie Sutton line from the Silicon Valley for trying to get people to understand there are many Robin ... that's a better analogy yeah how do you how do you kind of get the money to the rest of the ...\nOr you know there can you change though are you seeing more money I Know that's of lowering the system of revolution is to get more money there we've talked about other ways to get money those markets is that is that the biggest issue in us markets or do you see 'em with talked about talent rights when you look at you know these cities right is it money talent and what else is missing it\nIs it's all about it you know the ... money is important because of the money is not there are people\nDo leave and then I come back so that was size talent like that as you saw the show hands a lot of I Know the uh\nYou know great innovators here are from other places and so how do you make sure they you know the again this is a great place to be people want to be here they should be here a ... you know they shouldn't feel like they have to be here to be able to do something that's part of the sort of innovation\nOr economy so challenging some of these places which is one of the things that Silicon Valley there was so great is there is a sense of fearlessness here\nLike anything is possible sometimes like\nMaybe a little crazy and maybe comes off a little bit arrogant but that's a good thing that you know that anything is possible mentality in many parts\nOf the country they're kinda cautious kind of risk averse jumping on moral you know much of that is going to work\nYou know it's so so that that that cultural aspect is important so I'm not saying that aren't challenges there the night of monies are nine of talent there's not enough fearlessness but not enough connectivity there's a lot of network density here where people are ... you know connected sometimes again you know maybe to an extreme but but you know there are parts of the\nYou know the country we lack that kind of network Dempsey so this is a long haul up and that goes back to my you know experience with a\nA wall in those early days of the Internet without seems obvious\nFor a decade nobody was paying attention to what we're doing is most people do not believe there was a reason to get on line is like\nYou really think people are going to like sit at a\nKeyboard like type a message to somebody when they can just pick up the phone just doesn't seem like it's the mainstream phenomenon and we laugh but when we went public in Nineteen Ninety two first in our company goes public we'd been at it for almost a decade we had two hundred thousand customers\nA decade later was like thirty million customers so it was slow most people didn't believe it you know the eyes and the most people were skeptical and not get calls from my parents were like [noise]\nLike we love me and all but you know you're kind of passionate about this thing but it doesn't seem to be working [laughter]\nLike a plan beer and there's no I really think so and I so I I see the similar skepticism I talk about the rise ... lot of smart people quitting here they are now in respect\nTo look at me like okay I think he's well meaning\nBut but wrong he's these is is that going to happen the rest of not going to rise a but we think it will and frankly we can to otherwise you know this divide the country between you know kind of people who said before who feel like the\nFuture is going to be good for them and their families and their communities\nVersus bad for them is going to grow and that's going to release a lot of really bad stuff so we need to figure out ways to have a more inclusive approach to innovation and although a lot of that is focused on place the other points that I think are worth pointing out\nThat if you look at the venture capital data from the NBC aid from last year\nLess than ten percent of venture capital when two women\nOver Ninety percent when two men less than one percent went to African Americans so we are great onscreen nation you know we should be proud of that and Silicon Valley of the emphasis that and we should be proud of it\nBut if you look at the data it does suggest it does matter where you live does matter where you look like\nDoes matter who you know but if you have an idea you have that shot it turning into a company and the Senate shot at the American dream and that's not right and that's not smart we need to figure out a way to\nKind of level that playing field and in anything any of you can do to help would be greatly appreciate\nIt I think it's great what you've done and again the city that I visited with you um the the quality of companies the diversity of companies\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and into session will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Stanford ...\nI'm a healthy eating apple is do you think cities need\nBig home runs to get a kind of create that you could systems so you've got to do with security in Ann Arbor um sold for more than a billion dollars recently due to cities need big outcomes to really transforming to really get on the map for do you think it can be a lot of singles or doubles that will allow that\nTakes candy but clearly the home runs or helpful it is it it it gets people's attention and the capital of some which stays in the community because of the employees and some of the local office often angel investors\nWill simply redeploy that money Scott as an example and started after selling\nOr the sales force started a a a firm that it's basically a incubator adventure for now back several dozen companies and you know so it's got that are being kind of one shot thing is now going to become more of a sustainable thanks so that's a super helpful having a great university is super helpful\nOr there's a bunch of things that are super helpful but if you don't have that you still can make a go of it on and you know is that what we're trying to do is figure out in each of these communities what what's the next chapter for that region\nIn terms of building on its core strengths and trying to figure out where where it can really a kind of play a role in this in this next generation the other the other party should make 'em\nIs one of the you know the palace from the last healthcare session was from from ethic ethic as you may not know which is one of those are the leading maybe one of the main part of the top three health technology companies in the country\nIs not from here in Madison, Wisconsin I think I'd like ten thousand employees now for African Madison, Wisconsin so it's just another example of of of this sort of dispersion of innovation or that we think will accelerate him this in this third way\nAs part of the tax um law that got passed last year one of the things they create these economic zones or investment\nOn notice there's eight thousand seven hundred small economic zones around the United states most of them are in really impoverished areas or or areas that don't have access to the rich countries ride 'em a more investment there by lowering taxes for people that invested rockets\nIs that are you seeing that stimulated or is it not really having impact then\nYou get a little early ... I was a fan of that so called investing and opportunity\nAct was introduced about three years ago on a bipartisan way by Cory Booker and Tim Scott is and I've had broad support and vote for the Senate or not and the house and then got integrated into those tax reform bill to pass you know seven or eight months ago\nOr and so I took a few months for the you know some of the rules me runs every few months for the governor's in each state's of identify which are these opportunities that they would they would basically have these tax advantages\nAnd in capitals still is in the process of being you know kind of\nComing together around these ideas but there are definitely a bunch of people are looking at opportunities sons whether it be to invest and start ups are invested in in in real estate or other kinds of things I think it will be super helpful it's gotten people you know kind of saying\nWhat what are your what what what's going on there and and you know the tech capital gains a kind of benefits are pretty significant into that will result in people paying attention to opportunities\nOr otherwise you know weren't paying attention to and and that will hopefully accelerate this ah this ah this flow of capital\nIt's such a benefit if in fact that you hold the investment for ten years I Know it's a long time the taxes are actually zero on the games that you have on those investments so they really are trying to stimulate it um", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "04"}
