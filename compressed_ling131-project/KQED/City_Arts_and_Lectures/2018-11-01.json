com\nThirty eight Europe was on the eve of World War radio listeners had only recently been introduced to the phrase we interrupt this broadcast because they were cutting in the first dispatches from CBS correspondent Edward Murrow in his boys were covering the gathering storm from London\nBut the newspaper reporters did have something to work with\nPresumably we do know what are some wells himself was saying what was he saying\nWell there's interesting debate about that a a wonderful book by Paul hair called the medium and the magician argues that wells gave a shocked news conference right there and CBS headquarters because the reporters were telling wells that people had died and committed suicide because of his broadcast\nSo for many years people thought wells was really shocked and devastated\nWhen in fact hair discovered in some of the wells papers in Indiana it may have been the greatest acting performance of\nWells as career so Michael how many people really were upset by the broadcast in the war of the world so I mean\nYou know I've read than a million people were driven into panic by this\nRight the question you ask is a fascinating one because it gets right to the question of categories right are we to say that people were frightened by it or were people panicked by it because radio in the Nineteen thirties was designed to frighten you the shadow knows lights out those kinds of programs\nAnd we know those shows affected people in a really interior way because radio is this hot medium it's very different from television in that way and war of the world's fits right into that category\nI think what makes the world's different is people assume there was a panic a true panic at a whole different level that people were almost\nSoon there was a panic a true panic at a whole different level that people were almost terrorized and you can think of those words I'm not doubting that there was quite a bit of freight that night but I don't think it was much more than lights out the shadow knows and those kinds of programs\nWell but the times we're also different were they not I mean this was the fall of Nineteen thirty eight invasions really are happening around the world not and growers meals New Jersey but in places like Czechoslovakia I mean the public might have been primed to believe in this kind of catastrophic or influx of foreigners if you will\nI absolutely agree with you and especially because CBS was the network that decided to break into all its programming during the Munich crisis so if you were individual listeners CBS the previous month you would have gotten something like a hundred and fifty news emergency news broadcasts about the situation in Europe heading towards war\nAnd you would have been primed for this kind of thing but let's remember the audience was teeny it was so teeny that Ninety eight percent of the people surveyed on that night during that time were either not listening to it or listening to something different this show aired against the number one rated broadcast in America\nFinally than Michael what's the big picture what the take home message here because it seems\nSomewhat counterintuitive but it sounds like maybe the media do not have the kind of sway over us that we think at least if we take at face value this perception that there was mass panic there were death or whatever and that that wasn't true and it could be that we experience things supply goes by the media but we don't do non linear about it\nI I agree I think that is to take away I think there's many examples where the public did not react as people thought they would [noise]\nI mean if we move out of the realm of fiction into the realm of fact\nIf you look at several months following some of the most devastating attacks in America whether it's nine eleven whether it's Pearl Harbor there were arguments in the media that there was going to be slaughtered and massacres of thousands of for instance of the Japanese\nFalling Pearl Harbor or in after nine eleven and they were isolated anecdotal incidences but statistically speaking the kind of massive retaliatory panic that people thought what occurred didn't really occur\nYou know it occurs to me that we didn't years after this broadcast to only a few years Joseph ... in Germany was using the media to shape public opinion and uh I think was fairly successful do you think he took a lesson from all this\nOut a Joseph ... comment at the next day the newspaper reports are available at a website called crossroads ex R. O. A. D. S. dot com look at the radio in the Nineteen thirties website there\nThe Nazi press loved this story and they played it up very highly for several weeks specifically because it occurred after Munich and they thought the American newspapers were warmongering\nAnd they said look here's an example of why the American people think we Germans are aggressors because they assume everybody's coming to get them the American people aren't smart enough not to believe their media\nMichael ... thank you so very much for talking to this\nThank you\nMichael ... is an associate professor of communication and journalism at the University of Maine\nWhat's interesting here is that the media didn't correct themselves once they learned that really panic was overblown or you can understand why CBS might not do that because after all their show was the success at least measured in terms of audience reaction and you know for a horse and well it was a testament to his artistry yeah no such\nThing as bad publicity right and and mercury theater in the air was being threatened with cancellation 'em and certainly after this broadcast it was new and wells himself went on to become a star\nYou know that's a lesson for all people who are in radio and television today I suppose which is what you do something provocative and misleading and your show will be re opt for a new season that's a terrific message for a skeptic check program\nUh\nComing up that was Seventy five years ago when radio newspaper printed media threads that town does pay Google Twitter Facebook it would be hard to imagine being fooled Iran's broadcast today but that doesn't mean\nWe can't be why Americans love a conspiracy it's our monthly look at critical thinking skeptic jak war there were some big picture side

Oswald couldn't have killed Kennedy because Kennedy is still alive running the government from underground in Toronto just Google JFK and secret bunker but hey if you want to call conclusions drawn from fact paranoid it's a free old up\nWhat was that are they listening and I gotta go\n[laughter] are we off the rails paranoid some of us yes at times most of us maybe a little\nA senior editor at reason magazine Jesse walkers book is the United states of paranoia a conspiracy theory\nMaybe the Nineteen thirty eight broadcast avoid the world didn't send drove that people into the streets the Jesse ... says the reports that it did not popular impression that Americans will buy into anything\nAfter the play aired Walter Lipman very prominent political commentator a wrote an essay that's he warned against crowds that drift with all the winds that blow and are caught up at last in the great hurricanes\nAnd he said that these masses without roots are the chaos in which the new Caesar's are born this intense fear of a mess society mass culture\nAnd you know the impact of the new communications medium radio which you know more you know order elites weren't quite sure about how it might be used what sorts of demagogues might sees it\nSo would you say that this was really instrumental in feeding the notion that Americans could be manipulated by the media because that's a very popular notion and and maybe it was the arrival of radio itself said that generated that to what extent was the word the worlds broadcast responsible\nYet whether or not it's responsible for it it became the story people told it became this just so fable um that you know people people could point to to illustrate the dangers of a man with a microphone and an audience that easily misled\nWell you write that Americans do love conspiracy theories and even if they didn't really think we were under attack in Nineteen thirty eight a lot of them think that the aliens or a foot in the land to de ... what is it that Americans believe that that sounds like as an a kind of irrational point of view [noise]\nWell I think you know a lot of it is because Percival Lowell built this awareness this idea that there might be life there you know we never see science fiction movies were sent turning into attacking her third plutonium just always Martians because he really built that awareness so I think it's partly that partly you know Mars is red color this mysterious\nSometimes very bright object in the sky and then we have ... wells and certainly many other writers and then today we have lots of movies with the common theme\nWell movies or not I mean it's still the place where the big space agency spend the greatest effort looking for life although of course if there are Martians they won't be digging canals me maybe they'd be living in them but it's still target number one for those looking for life beyond earth\nAnd that's a really good point and that's you know another reason they use that Mars has been sort of a compelling thing is that you know it was believed back then to be very similar to the earth it had an atmosphere we can see polar ice caps on it's a Venus we were never able to see the surface ... shrouded in clouds but Mars\nYou know from what we can see through telescopes even back in most days you know it looks very similar to earth today we know that the atmosphere is very thin and is mostly carbon dioxide or which would be poisonous for us to breathe than\nBut back then they based on what they knew it looked like the most similar plan is out there to earth\nYou know I mean it's true that low himself in a in a way got it wrong claiming that the the Martians were busy with these shovel ready projects crunching up their planet\nYeah we know today that there's not the intelligent life like he thought much\nHe he thought there was intelligent life not just because of those canals but because of an advance theory of evolution that was put forward by Herbert Spencer and Darwin's theory of evolution um which was just put forth Nineteen fifty nine talked about biological changes\nBut others took evolution and interpreted in different ways Herbert Spencer thoughts that everything is a diverse can evolve in law took this to mean\nYou know look at planets we have young planets that are gaseous like Saturn and Jupiter and then the advance through middle age like earth and they get salad they develop life\nAnd then eventually they dry up and turn into debt rocks or like mercury and he believes that Mars was sort of in the same places are\nHeading on his way to mercury to become sort of a debt plan it but it's still in a stage of his evolution where there should be life there\nAnd he saw the canals as evidence of that theory\nYeah it certainly hangs together well finally\nKevin in the novel war of the world's Martians invade the earth\nBut there are stopped in their tracks because they get sick are bacteria do them in yep isn't it ironic today a century later earthlings are sending rovers to invade Mars and if there are any Martians it's most likely they are bacteria\nYou know somewhere down the road life is going to end eventually as the solar system continues to develop or in less we find a way of doing at first but ultimately the last thing surviving on earth will probably be\nYou know those those microorganisms or the cock roaches yeah all the nasty stuff that survives in any sort of conditions they're going to lung survive lesson you know it's sort of if we found their life on Mars that's pretty much what we would expect\nKevin Schindler thank you so very much for being with us thanks for having a son\nKevin ... is an educator at the Lowell observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona [noise]\n\nNext the

Welles podcast causes public melt down\n... get a grip hashtags fail but no one would really tweet that today because you know long before reports of an invasion of New Jersey caused a public freak out they'd be coiled on Twitter read it and Facebook\nI'm loving this little tiny radio drama yo I Wish Martians wouldn't be Trenton law\nSo even if today you heard those realistic news bulletins describing alien attacks and thought they just might be real quick searching the Internet with say straight\nBut of course that doesn't mean that the Internet doesn't spread hoax and myth indeed the Web turns like a veritable Grover milk of rumor but are the corrective forces of social media stronger than those that might mislead us\nKatie Culver is an assistant professor in the school of mass communication at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and she is also associate director for the center for journalism ethics there and as to the idea that the radio broadcast of war the world's would fool anyone today\nI doubt it would fool anyone today and and certainly not to the level that people perceive wells war of the world's frightened people back then I think the panic was overhyped and not actually maybe the problem that we would see today that reports of the panic would be part of the misinformation problem\nWell what about the fact that if you heard about this and in and if you even tuned in the next thing you do would be to get on the Internet do a quick search check your tweets check you're Facebooking and find out you know with other people thought of this I mean could you actually full so many of the people for so much of the time\nNo you couldn't fool that many people for that much of the time because we do use these social tools to debunk misinformation but we also use their social tools to spread misinformation so for instance with the Boston Marathon bombings you saw the online community Reddit\nFalling victim to a whole host of information for quite a sustained period of time as they tried to ... help with the investigation but actually were pointing to people who had no involvement whatsoever so sometimes they're force for good but sometimes they're not\nWell that was a case that I mean that was based in real event there's no doubt that the bombing in Boston Kurd and while many of these theories while I guess all of these these were wrong right uh I mean people were genuine and trying to help trying to provide real information\nWhat about the sort of opposite case I mean what if I go on their social media and I say that well said he's received a signal that indicates hostile spacecraft are headed for are going to be people who believe that\nThere certainly are going to be people who believe that and in academic circles we talk about something called motivated reasoning which has no matter how much we have been school and in fact the effect increases with how much we have been schooled\nOur personal beliefs affect how we perceive evidence so we'll counter argue evidence based on our beliefs if it conflicts with our beliefs and the more educated we are the more we will counter argue because here in schools we teach people how to argue quite effectively\nSo we'll find people who believe in a whole host of misinformation some which has put out there specifically to pollute are public sphere\nAnd they fall victim because they're motivated to believe what they believe\nThat's a very interesting point I mean does that explain the fact something that's always puzzled me\nThat when they do these polls do you believe for example that aliens crash landed at Roswell New Mexico Nineteen forty seven or or something like that that the credulity goes up with the amount of education if you've gone to college you're more likely to believe that story\nWell I I'm Sorry that I'm not an expert on here [laughter] if the wind up but it is true that education does track with motivated reasoning so them the better educated we are the more likely we are to fight back against evidence that counters our beliefs\nAnd so you'll see some very highly educated people for instance promulgated miss about the Affordable CARE Act for instance and a lot of attempts to counter act that motivated reasoning you know things like politifact putting out the Fifteen top nuts about Obamacare\nOr ah the president's organizing for America\nGroup actually creating a Twitter feeds specifically to answer those sorts of things they've got the the Obama for America truth team they call it specifically to debunk things a little like a chain email for instance that says that to pay for the Affordable CARE Act we're all going to have a new tax on home sales which is", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018",
