I Know there'll be lots of questions from the audience that tell us again why did you sit around and reflect on your long live by that I think he actually gave part of the answer\nNo no no I yeah I did get part of the answer\nI I did it because I think it's relevant to the moment that we're in I think Bob Woodward's book is a terrific summary and extraordinarily well reported as he does and every one of you in here knows that there is no way as publisher to be my publisher to and there is no way that she\nIs going to go to print without the lawyers being confident about sources and what he's dies has hundreds of hours of tapes so people need to be careful what they wish for in terms of documentation here and you'll or you're going to hear denials here and denials there but\nI think everybody knows how it works my book is the sort of okay it's terrible\nWe now have the ... the document what is happening\nBut what do we do about it and what should America look like what should we be doing in terms of making our system work and bring ourselves back to ground zero\nDamn democratically little league\nAnd um I did my book in the tracing of the things I've been involved in from the beginning of my raising my right hand there's a chapter called raising my right hand where I talk about why we went into service my my parents were greatest generation parents my mother\nI'm born in Paris or live the better part of our earlier not that none of our all of her early life in Europe because my grandfather was a was a\nBusinessman involved in a business in Europe at the time and live between England and France right up until World War two and a actually way back when he was involved with the actual Janine in the founding of the bank of America and to my regret sold his stock too early\n[laughter] uh uh\nSo my mother didn't come to America really until she's about twenty four years old\nBut she's American she comes from the Boston family and and she lived there and that introduced me to ward at very young stage I writing a book about how my earliest memories walking with my mother in France Nineteen forty seven I was four years old and holding her hand and she was crying\nAnd I didn't know why she was crying it upset me but\nI could feel like it here the glass crunching beneath my feet\nAs we walk through the ruins of what had been the family home and all that I remember seeing a chimney go up into the sky and the and the stairwells going up in the sky it was all of us left I remembered visiting the beaches Normandy four years after the war there was still the ... of war and those beaches\nYou know blown out tanks and so forth Higgins boats\nAnd it became it it it it just in Butte me with a sense of service sense of duty sense of responsibility and a group of us at Yale uh my good friend Freddie Smith the founder of FedEx who founded shut acts really in our dormitory when he got to see on his economics paper\nThat that was fed ex um and it's an a plus now folks a plush flush uh\nAnd and my room mate dandy but our bureau in into the Marines and and you know a bunch of us felt a sense of responsibility Nineteen sixty five when Johnson asked for troops and and we were part of that answer\nSo it right there because I think all of that journey without any arrogance without any sense of wild look at me or something that's not what it's about I think it's an American story I think it's an American journey\nAnd I think it represents how you make America the best of what we know it can be because of Nineteen Seventy one made a president who broke the law\nAnd and we had a president who was had an enemies list new attacked a governance and attacked people\nBecause he stood up in front of the country and said this agreement push too great a burden on the United states\nAnd the answer is no it didn't\nIt only undertook to do what we knew we could do with the support of major fortune five hundred companies ranging from the Google and the apples and so forth all the way to Exxon Mobil\nAnd BP and others all of them said we need to do this so we cannot have parts of what was the significance of powers the significance of Paris is that we\nBasically put our faith in the private sector which I Believe I I've grown more and more private sector Varina that over the years because as you watch the world changing as the dynamic changes we're witnessing industrial revolution sized changes and culture and society and workplace\nIn trade and in in globalization but it's happening at digital pace\nIs unprecedented and that's part of the anger that is still American workers in the American people because they feel increasingly disenfranchised and shocked and shell shocked by it all\nUh and watch a lot of the voter that Donald Trump appealed to by the way it's also a voter the Bernie Sanders appeal to\nAnd it's out there it's also in the center you don't have to be on the right or left to feel that way government is not working in America folks and we know in some of the reasons why and what we have to do about it but the bottom line with us back to the climate changes we were trying to send a message in Paris to the private sector\nOne hundred and Ninety six countries are all going to move in the same direction at the same time and that creates the largest market the world has ever seen\nThe energy market and why energy because energy is a solution to climate change\nThere's nothing we can do to change the course were on that isn't subject to making better decisions about how we create electricity what we do with our buildings how we burn oil or gas or coal and other things and how we moved to a renewable sustainable\nFuture the market that I knew in Massachusetts I represent Massachusetts twenty eight years we had a terrific tech base not quite Silicon Valley but\nAn earlier is very very strong and\nNot quite Silicon Valley but an earlier is very very strong and still strong and we had a one trillion dollar market in the Nineteen nineties with with what a one billion users the energy market is today foreign aside didn't use or market and the most ... trillion dollar market\nAnd it's going to grow to nine billion users and the next Thirty years is the biggest market the world has ever seen and by Donald Trump pulling out of Paris has pulled us out of the position of leadership and in that market\nSo but here's the rub\nThis is why I said I'm going to be the skunk parish goal was to keep the rise in the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade\nWe're probably right around one point three one point five already today we're right there but my friends in this century my grandchildren yours you're gonna live to experience\nA four degree rise in temperature for degrees is what we are on track to see now what you see barreling towards the coast the Carolinas today\nThe size of the storm intensity that repetitive with which it formed\nIs a direct consequence of the warming of the water and the increase of the moisture you have therefore in the air and therefore more rain\nHarvey Irma and Maria\nAll deposit it one storm Harvey alone deposit it as much water is lows over Niagara Falls in an entire year\nFive days of flooding and Irma was the first stormed to have a recorded one hundred and eighty five miles an hour is staying for\nTwenty four hours together these storms cost us two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the entire budget of the ... department and more money than the Commerce Department the Energy Department the education department about the whole bunch of apartments together this is insanity\nInsanity as secretary of state I went to Norfolk, Virginia and the largest navy base in the world and we talked with the military but what they're having to do because\nOf the preparations they did debate because of climate change and the rise of sea level I went to Antarctica because when I went to the Arctic the scientist there said Mr Secretary you got to go and are are going to really understand what's happening in terms of the changes so I went to Antarctica\nAnd lo and behold yeah I heard from scientists room Seventeen different countries about the repetitive with which the west Antarctic ice sheet which is three and a half miles deep ice is melting and and shows a Fisher\nLarson ice sheet broke off larger than the size of the state of Rhode Island and floated out to sea and they're afraid that the whole thing may melt\nThe right way we're going the Himalayan glaciers are melting glaciers are disappearing all over the world we're seeing the diminishing end of the of the cycle now you have an open seat in in the northwest passage in the summertime\nAnd people trying to exploited I mean it's changed last year for the first time in history\nWe recorded above freezing temperatures in the Arctic in February so you know I get angry when I when I think about this\nDonald Trump's decision to pull out of that agreement is going to cost lives it just is as good a cost billions of dollars of damage to property and you're going to witness something a bit in the next hours next days but that's just the beginning\nWe've had an average of southern hurricanes a year since Nineteen Seventy two in the Atlantic which is more than normal and now they're two other hurricanes behind Florence that are sort of building out there so my friends what do you do about it what is the solution would be doing well I'll tell you what the ... United States\nAnd if I were president today I Would have an emergency meeting of the G twenty I take the richest countries in the world and I said we're not leaving this room to we put together a climate action fund that helps less developed countries not have to build a coal fired power plant\nAnd we should stop every single coal fired power plant in the world from being ...\nThat's what we have to do why the dirtiest fuel in the world and it isn't the single biggest culprit with respect to global climate change and we're at a point now where we are locked in not just to preventing this from happening were locked in the mitigation adaptation so we're going to have to do things like the Dutch do\nTo prevent see from coming into the country this below sea level but guess what a lot of other places have got to find that challenge already the mayor of Miami is pumping water out of Miami Beach\nAnd the mayor of Miami Beach that mine is pumping water out in order to get sunny day high tide flooding out of the way\nSo we have water coming over to Boston or in in in Boston at the seat will you know that's comes in at a high tides any day now\nSo my friends long answer to you but I got to tell you something this is one of the most serious issues we face is actually central is solvable\nThere's no excuse for not moving more rapidly to alternative renewable energy solar is now completely competitive with coal is cheaper than coal\n'cause there's no there's no truth and accounting I don't know how many of your business\nBut you know there's no truth in accounting and in in this business today people say oh Cole is a three or four cents a kilowatt hour and solar is going to be sex with solar isn't a solar is lending contracts in the world at two point nine cents per kilowatt hour and so forth but coal\nWhich it doesn't ever taken the cost\nOf coal sludge coal dust black lung moving it by train or trucks from wherever it comes from the burning the cost of emphysema the cost of of of the single biggest cost of children being hospitalized in America during the summer is environmentally induced asthma\nWe spent fifty five billion dollars a year to deal with that and we can't find a hundred billion dollars to fund the ... and ... and so I'm just telling you folks were the greatest democracy in the world we're not making choices about the future we've got to start to reclaim our democracy and reclaim\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ...

I'm not being naive\nWe can make our democracy work but it is work it's hard work you have to go out and be part of the game and you have to drive people to go vote you have to go vote yourself you've got to give money to campaign so it can compete you've got to take part in it\nAnd and ... and I just ask you remember the words of Ben Franklin\nWhen he walked down the steps of constitution hall after they had finished their labor on the next generation of the constitution the United states and a woman shouted at him Dr Franklin tell us what do we have and they said backdoor oh she said do we have a monarchy or republic and he said a republic if you can keep it\nIf you can keep it that's the work of today I kid you not\nJohn McCain you've talked about other colleagues in the front of a Republican and I all cross or at times you had a long relationship he leaves your fellow Vietnam veteran what do you have to say about John McCain and how how you worked with him and and your relationship with them\nOver the years while I miss him as as I think America will miss him because he was a a truth teller\nA he knew he had some deviations himself one was on climate change when he was running for president because of the orthodoxy of his party and he was up front about those kinds of things which is one of the things people appreciate that about him but he had a as I wrote in an op ed after he passed away he had a great capacity for forgiveness\nWhich is which is partly what you need and what we need and our politics a little bit in the country\nJohn and I didn't know each other well when we went to the Senate I got to the Senate before John to try not to let him to get any given day it was about two years apart and he came to campaign against me Massachusetts though he never attacked me never mentioned by name and just talk to the other guy I write in the book about how that sort of was the way the game was played back then not any more but then\nBut in the Senate we were one day\nWe're on a delegation flying to Kuwait after the Desert Storm and a ...
