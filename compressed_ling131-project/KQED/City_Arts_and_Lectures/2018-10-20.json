I did see the back and forth exchange with\nKaren Finney unrest and they're like oh April's wrong it's not that bad who [noise] have always right [laughter] what what would you ... doesn't tell you is that I was calling Donald Trump's people was calling his secretary at Trump Tower trying to get an interview I was asking\nNumber Rosa they don't tell you that was talking to Ben Carson's people and I'll tell you I was talking to Ted Cruz is people are Jeb Bush's people then I'll tell you I was also talking to to a Bernie Sanders people that's what they don't tell you\nBut it's all one side of the um and then so that that I'm supporting Hillary and I'm trying to do all this so I'm like whatever so then in her warped way of trying to make people things that I've done something wrong to cut our friendship off\nShe tells people I'm taking money from Hillary Clinton uh-huh yes that will kill a career\nI've worked hard my parents' sacrificed for me and they have gone the glory and I would do them a disservice if our fallen under that track so I talk about it in the book but um she all all of\nThis was an effort for her to look good in this Trump Administration so when it comes to reading her book no thank you when it comes to her tapes yeah those are taped but\nAnd he denied it but still I Want to hear from I'm going to listen and I want to get in I Want to get it on tape 'cause I Want to put the pieces of the public gets when it's when it's in chaos and dismay you can't put it together but at least you can kinda see a little bit more clearly in that murky mess\nWas going on but um no I mean you have to talk to people you have to listen to what people have to say because sometimes there is truth within the law or the live within the truth I don't know\n[noise] you know one of the the reasons I I Love the commonwealth club audience is because they have such good question I'm scared so here's another [laughter]\nI can you comment on Trump's attack on female reporters thank you is this workplace harassment [noise]\n\nSo you're talking about what happened today\nI'm livid about that how did you bring some folks up to speed maybe okay how many have you watched it today how many have you heard the news accounts of it today\nOkay there's a large portion of donor okay Cecilia Vega and I'm\nCaitlin Collins Cecilia from ABC and Caitlin from CNN Caitlin just within the news a couple of weeks ago\nAsking questions in the oval office and he wouldn't answer when he asked another ... an Oval Office asked reporters we are supposed to question\nAnd here's the thing these press conferences up until now I mean when did they have press conferences just on one issue down thousands of issues that are happening at one moment in time\nThe White House is where everything comes war and peace and everything in between and it's not just a moment that is just this week on North Korea out there and we've got cabin uh we've got voting issues [noise] we've got ...\nWe have so much stuff on the table and that's not even if we got China we've got all around we got a lot of stuff on it we got water they're still not safe to drink you know we've got Nike you know we thought there you know\nWe've got the Steelers the last of the ravens last night [laughter] so ravens [laughter]\nBut um but no but ah so the president decides to shut Caitlin down and say that's what I Know we're talking about we're talking about this\nAnd he was just really nasty to her [noise]\nSilly Sicilia gets up and says something I something which she said I I'm confused some some of the law to he said yeah you don't you don't know what you're doing or something along that line on a national international TV demeaning this woman and you know what happens now when people see say they're going to say that to her ...\nAnd it was taken out of context 'cause she may have been confused with who he was going to have something so I wasn't there today because I was coming here to be with you but when I saw it on on the torture and I went off\nBecause it makes not one ounce of says it makes not one ounce of sense because I'm I'm a I'm tell you because\nThe residue from that stuff when they when Sarah and the president do that stuff to me I could death threats yeah it's real and that's almost say but\nWomen are important men are important but women are so important and at a time such as this here me less than six weeks out from a midterm election I don't care who you vote for but vote [laughter]\nThank you [laughter] [noise]\nToo many people were bruised bloodied and had hoses\nBurning their flesh and dogs tearing their skin is for the white foster vote and I'm Sorry I vote please black white jujitsu Protestant Catholic go to those polls politics as personal but go vote your personal whatever so here's the deal\nLess than six weeks out of an election now this is this is from a reporter said this is from a human stand and this is from a woman's dances from a White House correspondent and somebody dean of the White House press corps whose voice means something who covers them okay\nYes I might be two years old but I still cover them so let me say this to you it bothers me\nBecause we didn't demean us they're not he might do it to Jim Acosta but he's doing it to women he started to me he's ... these women a credible they ask great questions with the problem is they're angry they are angry at the questions we asked because they know we are making a difference\nAnd that's one thing that Steve Bannon and when I said we're making a difference people are listening and they're getting they're listening with the critical here to understand we're not asking these questions oh well Mr President what did you think about the wind today was a too windy\nAnd now we're asking real questions about having a at a time and for this president to react this is another thing for this president this Republican presidents we act\nLike that against the White House press corps at a time when we're sick are less than six weeks out from an election and his party is losing women and independence he's not thinking about his party or his his obligations to the White House\nIndependence he's not thinking about his party or his his obligation to White House he's thinking about his person that's from political and and reporting analysis that I've seen over the two years I'm up close with him so now\nThen at a time when we're dealing with Kavanaugh this makes a difference with Kevin I'm gonna tell you why you got women out here who who are crying because they've been sexually assaulted and felt that the fourth of pain\nAnd Dr Ford is looking to this president the leader of the free world for help with the FBI and he's downing women how does that make her feel and women's ...\nThose are things that are on the table this is a historic moment in time it's not about playing this press conference about doing the press conference\nIt's not about going against women and ... and I'm just tell you the Republican Party is going to take a hit for that today there's a poll from CNN the sense that they don't like how the president is treating the press I was one of the first ones that people started to sing they saw this today they saw you\nCan't shake you know everybody wants to shift history but this you saw this if you didn't see it and Googling YouTube it Mm I'm Serious it's painful to watch\nIt makes me feel like we're back in in in caveman days women are objectify we don't mean anything\nBut you know it's not about our gender it's about us being credible journalists that you trust them and disrespected like that by the leader of the free world and those white men and I'm not\nSaying this in a disparaging way but those why because Washington is a male white male dominant in town\nAnd those were women the women and minorities don't fare well in a town of we've for every stride that we make were pulled back those white men were standing behind him smirking and laughing and did not help the situation so all of them because\nAnd I'm\nA I'm a lover of everyone I ... I have friends of all races creed everything but I'm going to tell you I Believe in every one being\nOn the same footing I Believe in equality but I Believe in calling it out when it ain't right on it and that's when you call it out that's a part of the American democracy what we were founded on we the people who are still forming a more perfect union we're going through growing pains right now and the only way to fix it is to call it out [noise]\n\nAnd that's and that's part of freedom of the part that's like part of the first amendment of the constitution and if we don't call if we just sit there and let it happen\nThe first amendment the freedom of the press part is going to be gone we got to ask founding fathers our founding fathers these wonderful men who I'm sure had slaves ... did not anticipate April wind a descendent of a slave to be questioning an American president I stand on what they wrote\nThey didn't expect that they were going to have a ... or a Donald Trump is president but we still stand on what things this president took an oath of office to uphold the constitution on January Twenty one twenty Seventeen and that part there's a problem we need to call it out\nBecause if we face the press is shut up down you're not going to get the information is not about just about you freedom of the questions about your freedom of information from the highest office in the land and transparency because right now you're not having press refunds and you're not saying nothing\nToo\n[laughter]\nAnother question for you but [laughter]\nAll the insults and lies that\nWhite House press conferences has the press considered\nNot attending a holding their own conference me there [laughter] if we so we're going to hold our own Prescott okay okay [laughter]\nNo let me say this year I've heard every once in a ... boy touches a boycott [noise] no no boy ... let me tell you why as soon as we walk out those door to door to boycott they're going to shut the door on a\nAnd every time we lose ground we don't gain it back so we have got to stand we've got to continue when they come with the lie or spin we've got to come back with the fact we got to fact check we're not going I boycott our protests fight back perfect bail warring on\nUs we're not our fight is information we can't be we hate the ... we hate the ... no I still have respect for the office I still have respect for him but I'm going to call you out when you're wrong but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "20"}
