you might soon twenty Seventeen the number of shared bike doubles to one hundred thousand nationwide and investors are pouring money into more than thirty start up companies deploying bikes and scooters around commercial and residential neighborhoods\nAnything that makes transportation more affordable and more accessible more equitable potentially is worth a lot on\nSunday the store is cofounder of boosted boards and CEOs skip scooter two of those new mobility come but some older start up they're also getting into the bike and scooter game\nIf the opening of rats they want to have ride hailing they want to have ... and they have electric scooter is\nThat's making roads ... reporter with tech crunch numbers business model famously caught officials in many cities off guard the newer mobility companies are facing stricter requirements to deploy around the country\nRegulators are quickly coming up to speed on oh yeah we kind of control the streets we can ask for are things that meet our equity and climate and other goals\nStuart Cohen is executive director of transformed the transit advocate you can join host reg dolphin along with negative Dicky on Sundays I store at a recent climate one event to discuss the new urban mobility [noise]\nSon Jay let's begin with you or seven years ago you started boosted bores what was your inspiration your goals starting a\nSkate parts company [noise] yeah it was an odd choice because I'd never skateboard before but we were a group of us were in graduate school at Stanford Stanford has a very spread out campus in Palo Alto as a city is a little bit far from campus for walking and so the boosted board was kind of a fun\nThing we built for ourselves to be able to get around the campus in covering these short trips in between buildings are parking lots or being able to take it onto the Caltrans system that that the transit system in the bay area\nUm and be able to cover the short distances and what we found was that people liked it because it was interesting and cool but then after they started to use it they said well I was actually changed the way that I get around my city\nSo it started you know the classic story of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur you know ... or solving a problem in their life and starting a company to to to address that\nThink a problem in their life and starting a company to to uh to address that are making rose sticky where is this happening to give us a sense of the geographic scope of the scooters bikes that are popping up\nYeah I mean it's worldwide especially with bike share we see effects Sherry and I'm In China like it's that's where it really kind of took off and then\nWith with these electric scooter is receiving them all across the nation and San Francisco and Austin, Texas\nUm and actually not requiring a home and those places is partially because uh there's great infrastructure that was built in those cities to support bicyclists that's separate from the way that cars are treated in the speed at which cars going next to the bicycles and partially because helmet usage you know deep ... adds more\nA friction one more thing to do I think for a shared systems to succeed if you look at Citi Bike in New York for example um you know they don't require helmets that program has been very successful or forego bike here and in San Francisco\nUm so I think the future eventually is fewer people using helmets that will be but I think it's important that access to those helmets that if someone wants to be safe or they have the opportunity to do so\nI still recovering um you know is this a case of you know nanny government should government regulate safety in this place or should have kind of like provide a safe place don't regulate helmets\nI I think government should push safety but I Do think the main danger out there continues to be vehicles and vehicle collisions\nI'm with people and so um I I think some days right that when we hear about all these people complaining about it being on the sidewalk\nLet's take that energy and create more space on our streets for shared vehicles and for the sustainable modes of of bikes and scooters I think the scooters you know you have to go pretty slow on a sidewalk even if you are weaving between people\nUm so so to me it's really a call with all of these new options to get more separated infrastructure for bikes for scooters for things\nAre and and I think you're right like with bike share it\nGiving them priority that's up next when climate one continues [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n... talking about the new urban mobility making roads ... a senior reporter with that crunch [noise] Stewart towing executive director of transform\nAnd send you a story you know skip scooter here's your host red golfing ... million rows thinking why are ...\nAnd lift getting into this they you know what's in it\nFor their greedy and they want everything [laughter] but really I mean that's that they\nI mean over his new ... CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said that\nWhoever wants to become this multinational transportation platform meaning if you open overlap they want to have ... they want to have ... and they want to have electric scooter is they want to have aerial taxis like they wanted they blow their effect trans delivered jeez yeah um\nAnd both ... brand left are looking into a\nElectric scooters as well as bike share and yeah like I said they just want to they want to own transportation\nSo that you whether it's a one mile saying or a five mile thing airport run or a hop downtown they want ... it'll be are left to be the place you go to do that I'm Stuart Cohen what do we know about ... burn left in terms of what they're taking people out of you know to get into their cars are they coming out of transit what are they coming from\nYeah well there's been a growing number of studies ah but I think one of the best ones came out a UC Davis recently where they were actually able to really interview folks in seven largest cities and uh found that a good number of the trips they put it at forty nine to sixty one percent\nWere coming out of either walking biking transit a or a trip that would have been made it all about twenty percent of those ones have been made at all ah and and so the other portion then are replacing a you know drive alone or or a car pool trips and so they also said that\nYou know there is some amount of debt heading its range between twenty to fifty percent that's when they're driving looking for somebody so kind of putting on miles\nAnd so on that report said that you can't really nailed down how much extra a miles of travel are happening but that direction early ah we're pretty sure that they're increasing the number of miles being driven on our roads\nWhat we need to do to change that is that right now you pull up your app and it's just so convenient both lifted Newberg to just go with that single ride\nA I Know list at least has started to\nChange their app so that it will encourage shared rights including just showing you how much less expensive it is and kind of giving you a guaranteed time um and then they would be putting on\nYou know bike share scooter onto that and so\nSo the benefit in some ways of having a lift and Newburgh it into this is that you get to see less expensive more sustainable a modes stacked up against a what's currently something that might be increasing the amount of driving this takes place\nSo that gets to the greenhouse gas impact which is what we were concerned about here at climate one\nYou know we know that you bring leftover increasing the number modern congestion cars on the road and so are you saying Stuart Cohen that\nHaving scooters versus well is that one mile you know I could pop on scooter and and go there for a dollar and maybe they'll show me the greenhouse impacted the carbon emissions or take a car and it'll ... is is that we're going\nI think it is a a a large number of those trips are under three miles and that's where the bike sharing scooters can really come into play and sort of a you know one of the lift uber trips is seven dollars in that range you know six to seven dollars and\nUh the bikes or you know one to two that's a very big price difference\nAnd uh you know the speed might not be all that different as well uh and so are you especially in downtown it of course might be might faster the ultimate things really um also showing how far it would take to walk because a lot of trips are one to two miles and you know by the time you wait by the time to sit at the lights\nYou could do that walk and twenty five minutes and and that's the most sustainable way to go but to encourage that to encourage these more simple but we need\nTo really rethink how transportation happens ah and if we're going to have real sharing a of of vehicles or whether it's on transit or\nIn you know lifting other modes that we've got to be giving them priority and that's a whole separate issue\nMaking rose Dickey transportation is a big sometimes number two expense for some people after after housing you know our scooters bikes kind of making mobility more affordable accessible for low income communities\nI Would definitely say more affordable but um\nMiles and you know by the time you wait by the time to sit at the lights you could do that walk and twenty five minutes and and that's the most sustainable way to go but to encourage that to encourage these more simple but we need\nTo really rethink how transportation happens ah and if we're going to have real sharing a of of vehicles or whether it's on transit or in you know lifting other modes that we've got to be giving them priority and that's a whole separate issue\nMegan rose Dickey transportation is a big sometimes number two expense for some people after after housing you know our scooters bikes kind of making mobility more affordable and accessible for low income communities\n[noise] um I Would definitely say more affordable but on accessibility kind of depends on the the company itself and I'm like like one example so with with a jump jump bikes ad\nWhich still ... they they first launched in a low income area in the city of San Francisco to just to kind of more deliberately say like hey we want to make sure that this is\nAccessible to low income people from the get go and then once we know that that's going to work there and then we'll kind of broaden out the um like the pilot program essentially\nAnd that is part of the requirements for San Francisco's permitting process to show okay how are you going to make sure that you're\nEither that this form of transportation is accessible to underserved communities\nSome Jay why is this happening now I mean there was the Segway Fifteen Years ago razor you know how many kids have had razors scooters been around forever why this sudden proliferation now what's enabling this yet it's a few things so I I think there's\nBroadly this push towards the bike lane being a a way to solve a lot of the transportation needs especially the density where campus or or dense neighborhood and I think a lot of that comes from one of the car lane is a serving us better overtime or worse\nAnd I think there's a lot of evidence suggested the Carlene is less and less of the best solution for certain types of trips especially in cities and has said he's getting more dense and as\nYou know e commerce delivery trucks are blocking lanes or as lifting Hoover cars are pulling over there's a sense of well as the Carl and really the fastest in most effective way to get around to the bike lane has seen a growth in popularity so if you look at the ... even ... long standing programs like city bike in New York\nOr you've seen ridership grow in the popular in the program increase and then separately there's a technology component to this now everyone has a smart phone they can hail a car just you know by pushing a few buttons on that phone they can uh you can embed those same phone components into a vehicle for very very low cost and now these vehicles can have GPS\nAnd dramatic Stuart Cohen Koch brothers who transit killers\nNew York times story recently about them opposing a funding for transit systems around the country a true or false uh Megan row sticky most scooter start ups will fail\n[laughter] I think it was true a son to

you put it on your Twitter feed let's give them around for getting through that [noise]\nYou're listening to a conversation about new forms of shared an electric trends in this climate one\nComing up ... just how much energy we can see why not choosing the car for a shorter trips what's really interesting about vehicles that are designed for the bike lane is that the consumption for miles so low that you could really look at how do you reduce the energy footprint of our transportation\nSets up next for one continue [noise]\n... [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to climate one thread Dalton is talking about the new urban mobility Megan Rosa Vicki senior reporter was French Stuart Cohen executive director transformed infantry deaf doors CEOs skip scooter\nSon Jake talk about job creation one of the\nCriticisms of rubber left as if those are not really real jobs or their side lines for people some similar things happening and scooters where people can collect scooters and charged him overnight get paid to address the employment and job side of the scooters that yeah it's it's really interesting I I think it's kind of a double edged sword\nI mean the fact that I could choose to start a new job you know in the gig economy and a week later or even less to be earning money is really powerful right when people have a change in their financial circumstances or when they just choose to to make a change in their life\nOn the ability to kind of on board that very quickly versus going through a vocational program or long training program or a university degree means that you can really start earning money quickly whether that's through start ups like air being being renting at your home or\nYou know in ... post mates and who bring left you know you can earn money and a lot of different ways so I think\nI'm this is another way for people to do that and it's it's great because it matches that need and that desire from folks with the fact that he scooters do need to get charged and moved and everything I think in the long run it's important like with all of these companies to have some kind of sustainable\nUm and predictable way for people to engage on the labor side I mean what did that with training whether that's with\nNo benefits whether they should be contractors or W to employees I mean that that's an important conversation that that we're seeing and I think especially for transportation systems\nUm if you look at mass transit if you look at a ride sharing now especially um there's a sense like these are here to stay and so we should be investing not just for the next thirty days or sixty days of the start up slight but actually over many years to make sure this is an important part of the fabric of the other community\nUm so we're making a lot of investments in San Francisco towards training for things like maintaining the scooters repairing them um we've made some big commitments to some groups um is part of our permit process to say what we'd actually like to do this the right way and not just a bring up a bunch of gig economy workers um and then have no nothing for them on the back and\nBegin rose Dickie ... will do the gig economy workers come out and and after they pay for the electricity or they cut it out of hand\nIt's funny my boss he he asked me if I Would like sign up to be a lime juice or or whatever and I which is like what they call their chargers um and I mean he can get\nAnd I which is like what they call their chargers um and if he can get like at least like\nFive dollars per scooter or something on that and I had to fill out\nLike a W nine and blah blah blah and then it would could complicate my taxes and then I was thinking well what about my energy to connect Spencer my energy bill so [laughter] I said no [laughter] but I I think that so that was one one issue like I'm not sure if these people are going to see like higher energy bills but\nBut also just the issue with the gig economy aside there's no insurance or health benefits and so you're really just kind of on your own for this to be\nEven though yes some companies are saying well like we're providing jobs people in these low income areas it's like\nOK cool but these are like really good jobs like these are in jobs that are going to really like help people with their quality of life\nRight it sounds pretty darn complicated but you just described going through all those who are just trying to understand your electricity bill without charging scooters is is is a challenge\nStuart ... before we go to audience questions I Want to come back to the times square the New York city story because that was really seminal that really set off a national wave of you know redoing American cities and bikes would tell us to Times Square story that happened under Mayor Bloomberg\nOh sure so uh they had a visionary department of transportation commissioner Jeanette ... Khan who really said you know these streets are for all people and not just for vehicles and uh in Manhattan the most dramatic thing they make ... create many squares\nA mini bike lanes but they Times Square where you could barely walk on the sidewalk and everybody's trying to take pictures and is a dangerous situation\nThey started with a kind of one of the biggest forms of what they call tactical urbanism where you just set something up for six months or a year as a pilot project sometimes you can do it for a day just like painting or parking day where you take over a parking lot\nAh and they set it up there was conjecture that there would be you know\nCongestion was already crazy so it would you know the uh people wouldn't be able to get through on ... on on uh the traffic\nUm but they made it work uh and uh the traffic mostly works about the same as it did before a in terms of the car speed but like you now have is this incredible place this gathering place or where uh most of the street space has been given over to people and they've\nNow made it permanent at first they threw down beach chairs and they made it permanent but the great thing is it's being replicated all over the country I was the most highly visible one um and you even see places that you don't think of in Indianapolis or Fort Worth Texas\nI'm saying hey we should make our downtowns vibrant\nAnd have that attract you know residents and businesses and you know things on Fort Worth they had thirty five\nAcres in the center of the town and a lot of it was parking lot and\nThey started showing movies and having games and dances and ah and then it built the momentum for this uh Sundance Square that it's called and now it's kind of a just a wonderful you know outdoor living room for the city and the more that we can\nCreate places you know we used to have a ten years ago to talk about walkable urbanism really great places to walk and now you know increasingly focused on kind of ... urbanism places that you just want to be a want to be able to be with friends family um and the trick is how we keep these places affordable because\nIt's incredible once you have a wonderful urban place like these places you might visit around the world in Europe and elsewhere\nA it's a huge tractor and the thing that we're losing in San Francisco with it and in other places as the diversity that originally made a great\nUh and that attracted so many of us so I think with this conversation a lot of it ends up leading to focus on equity and the reason we're in the game on on all of this new mobility we have a report called framework for social equity a new mobility it's kind of\nHow do we make sure that if Logan folks are spending thirty one percent of their income on transportation now that as we roll out these new models they're incredibly accessible they're located in the places for the people that need them most and they're used not as a form of displacement of gentrification like there is sometimes seen\nBut they're used as a way to bring down the transportation costs an increase access or we can actually keep people here we're talking about new mobility\nWith Stuart Cohen from transform Megan rose to confirm tech crunch and scientists Stuart from Princeton boards I'm Greg Dalton we're going to go to our audience questions welcome to climb and one\nI think you for your time um my question is why do you guys think the the scooter companies are kind of being singled out for this data sharing and you know other aggressive members when historically speaking companies like air being be or ... demonstrate a negative impact on our community and\nThere was none of this type of like a big backlash back to making", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "18"}
