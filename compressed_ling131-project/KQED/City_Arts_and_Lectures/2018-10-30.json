{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KQED", "content": "'kay key weedy San Francisco cake Huey I north highlands Sacramento the time is eight PM\n[noise]\nWelcome to world affairs the weekly broadcast of the world affairs counsel them and Jane whales CEO [noise]\nA growing number of America's wealthiest citizens are devoting significant ...\nTheir purpose is to advance the social good but can they make up for some of the inequities that allowed them to amass fortunes to begin with this is among the questions raised by a non ... he's the author of the new book winners take all the elite charade of changing the world\nModerating the program as my co host Michel ... fish broadcasters made possible each week by the generous supporter Chevron the M rare and the drink or waitress capital and foundation\nI'm happy to be here with an injured artist and my name is Marcos couldn't lock isn't together we have many syllables [noise]\nUh [noise] you know it's a it's really a pleasure to have you here and to discuss your evocative title winners take all ah it is not a question mark it as a statement there should be an exclamation point he is suggesting that winners do in fact take all you talk about elites\nAnd you talk about their desire to do good and and you often within the book talk about this concept of when when\nAs I was reading a parts of the book it reminded me a little bit of a an I'll take a little bit of a stretcher ... it reminded me a bit of how to tackle companies function so that tobacco companies\nTend to do a lot of bad in the world they tend to give us cancer create health problems of all sorts but they're the companies that expand the most on anti smoking campaigns\nThat sadly a very smart way to think about it and it may be a side of the more extreme forms and some of the cases were thinking about but to step back I came to the subject of this book because of an observation of a paradox\nThat fits very much in the terms of that tobacco example but extend very much to our whole society and the paradoxes of falling on one hand\nIt is hard to walk down the street without bumping into a plutocrats trying to change the world okay they're probably some and this rift there you there probably is I'm In this room and you know we hope you give generously\nUm [noise] you know\nWe have a new person announcing a multibillion dollar gift\nEvery couple of days in the newspaper write many of them in the city\nAnd we now have in in San Francisco a contest between billionaires about who's approach to homelessness is more generous and we have a hundred and eighty four super rich people having signed the giving pledge to give most of their assets away\nOr in their lifetimes when you go shopping in the mall or you know it's hard to avoid all these products that promise to change the world the iPhone case change the world and bottle is involved somehow\nI'm tote bags are gonna change the world socks that are going to change the world when I go to college campuses you find young people who are it's hard to not find young people who are determined to start a social enterprise involving Rwanda recycled poop\nYou know coffee uh and and like give one get one you know a Tom she was somehow connected and\nAnd that\nOn the part of elites whether they're billionaires or just young people with with great educations sits on easily next to another set of facts which are all also familiar which is the fact that this is the most unequal time in a hundred years in this country and getting worse at that last year the wages of the top one percent of ...\nIs the fact that this is the most unequal time in a hundred years in this country and getting worse at that last year the wages of the top one percent of four times faster than the bottom Ninety percent at the fact that last year at eighty two percent of all new wealth created in the world went to that top one percent in the world and the fact\nThat the bottom half of Americans have not gotten a raise on average since Nineteen Seventy nine and so what you have the paradox\nIs real and manifest elite generosity in our age\nReal helping sitting uncomfortably alongside elite hoarding and the very people in many cases doing that helping as in your example doing the generosity starting a disruptive tech company that's gonna emancipated mankind writing huge checks\nScene of taking care of the homeless those same people are the people harvesting most of the rainwater of progress and grabbing it for themselves\nAnd claiming to be making that were better\nAnd so I became interested in the relationship between that elite helping in that elite hoarding um between the giving and taking and I spent\nI'm a reporter so I don't I apply and at the end of report and and I went and report it is that what I did and I spent time in this world I spent time with 'em entrepreneurs and philanthropist\nAnd young people trying to figure out what to do with their lives and many others and my conclusion at the end of that\nJourney of reporting of a couple of years was that when elites stepped into the arena of social change they don't sit in the back row they sit in front row they got on the board of directors of change Inc they take over change\nAnd when they take over change they change change they read defined change in winter friendly ways\nSo on any issue you could pick say empowering women there's kind of real change and we know that I Would look like family policy that would actually be\nHelpful women on the board of regulations that you know harassment laws so getting grow up to the office on an everyday reality for people um\nMaternity leave just to do something that every other rich country does um but those things are all expensive for winners and men and people with power so what the winners of our age do is they don't say no women you can't get empowered because that would work\nSo what they say is that's all great ... ... you know I had another idea so it's more of a win win and we will tell you to lean in\nAnd then you lean in\nAnd things of the great\nNow never mind that they have just turned discrimination against women into a problem that women are supposed to solve in their private time\nUm but that kind of ... to wear a social problem that can frankly only be solved through real change real reform law's movements policy\nIs turned into a win win or friendly thing where change can happen without changing who has power\nWithout disturbing the status quo without\nCosting the people on top anything and I think you can take education\nAnd and do a similar analysis of real change would mean equal public schools for everybody and not marine having better schools and you know south San Francisco but then you can have fake change which is like what's the one charter school for three hundred kids and I'll tell my friends that I help those\nThree minority kids get into Yale it'll be great and and I think you can on any example in American Life you can you can think of where we are hearing real change and pushes for real change in where we're hearing the fake change and my argument in a nutshell\nIs it fake changes what you get when you put the people most with most to lose from real change in charge of change well\nYou know your statistics were fascinating in fact you noted were in San Francisco today we're recording this in California and in fact California is in a global sense the fifth largest economy in the world\nAnd yet as probably everyone in this room knows about a quarter of our population is living below the poverty line\nSo that reality is something that we're confronting on a daily basis and the change in fact would be able to take care of that part of our population in that we're not seeing necessarily the types of uh abilities\nEither at the state level or within playwright industry to be able to make the type of change that you are highlighting which of course we should all be concerned about on a daily basis [noise]\nUm but uh are there places and you alluded to this or are there places that are not necessarily system preservation\nStructures are around the world that ah that do this better you I think we're talking about family policies that exist in these wealthier nations other developed nations around the world\nCan you let's touch on that a bit and then we'll return to the sort of system preservation idea that you're you're you're talking about a written about quite eloquently\nFirst of all just to pick up on your San Francisco point the numbers are important there are about Seventy four hundred Ninety nine homeless people in San Francisco but left town and coincidentally Seventy four\nBillionaires it's about a hundred and one billionaires hundred and one homeless people per billionaire\nSeventy four billionaires in the city if the city and the not just the city the five counties around that if this area where a country five counties yeah it'd be the ninth ranking country on earth for billionaire population the idea that ... that such a problem could persists\nWell you know the rethinking and the question of how it leads are looking at the book about elites where you're challenging them I guess is in part answered in that Bill Gates is one of your ... on the back of your book so if you can explain that to me let me know [laughter] and use the top blurb on your on the back of your book\nUm you know this question of trumping the effect that he's\nCreating on our society I think he proudly sees himself as a disruptor and I think he is disrupted\nThe thoughts and the solutions as you say that we've all\nBeen operating on as a nation and has reactivated in many ways our our society to organize regardless of where you fall on the spectrum\nAre ... are really regenerated and re engaged a large part of our society but you know when you look at the ... the structure that we are talking about and and the challenges to that structure that is\nSelf promoting in self I'm ... and as as a acting in ways that you are suggesting to ah to change\nChange um journalism in many ways is a part of that self preservation system I mean when we talk about this perception that we have of the billionaires and the those who are doing good and doing well at the same time\nA lot of the narrative and the myth that is being created is being created within the pages of our former\nInstitutions my current institutions\nHow do we affect those institutions\nThe great question and and I you know I think one of the\nWhen I was at the very early stages of thinking about the book I read that the caddy book that many of you bought and maybe didn't read fans of heavy book and in the early ... when it first or second chapter there's a passage and where he ... he\nHave your book and in the early ... when it first or second chapter there's a passage um where he's he's he's describing the levels of extreme inequality in the fact that it's going to get worse\nBut he says whether or not this level of extreme inequality as sustainable or not depends not only on the repressive apparatus I don't know exactly what that means but it sounds tough\nBut also on the effectiveness of the apparatus of justification and I just read that phrase and I underline the circle that they underline it again then on the side\nThe apparatus of justification and it occurred to me that that was that was the marching orders from my book his book is not about that he was that was an offhand comment and I said that's what I got to go do I got to figure out the apparatus of justification\nAnd I really believe a lot of these extreme in equities and this culture that tasks that people who caused our biggest social problems with fixing them and tasks that people who who the winners who took all to kind of helped build them or just the economy a lot of that happens in the realm of culture and as you rightly say in newspapers a lot of it happens\nBecause of a casual sense that mark soccer burgers a world changer because of the Fast Company magazine covers that Venter eight entrepreneurs instead of asking about their tax strategies\nUm that runs stories about Johnny I've changing apple instead of running a story about why the ends at community college right next to apple is so starved for funds even though it's been the shadow of one of the most valuable companies on earth that has two hundred and eighty five billion dollars\nOffshore and where apple executive send their kids to go swimming right and it is it it has been a choice in journalism to participate in a kind of frankly Trump be generation of billionaires\nCelebration of wealth as tantamount to intelligence\nUm and particularly when people turn to giving phases there's there's definitely some scrutiny of people making their money\nBut when people turn to the giving phase there's almost no scrutiny right and\nYou know the fact robbery shoes a professor of political science at Stanford has a great book coming out of plants or be a couple of couple of weeks he says you know philanthropies an exercise of power and therefore like any exercise of power\nIt should inspire skepticism knock gratitude okay when people serving the military they often do so with noble intentions we have a military because we want to Brazil they make the world a better place well that's fine but none of us to say thank you so much and go home\nWe've got thousands of reporters covering that military we have multiple congressional committees\nInvestigating that military we have watchdog groups right\nNone of that exist for philanthropy we've just assumed that because it's noble it's noble it's good well philanthropy changes the public conversation it alters the marketplace of solutions\nIt has a direct impact on people's lives it affects what diseases or fought and whether or not fought it's an exertion of power\nAnd when you put your name on buildings it helps you wipe dirty reputations clean et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAnd I'm not sure how many American publications\nHave a philanthropist correspond was four hundred and ten billion dollars last year and that's how much ... that's a lot of money to basically not cover um that's just a lot of exertion of influence you to not cover and you think we go so hard after like\nSome lobbying firm that takes five million dollars you know which we should but like there is stuff happening and philanthropy that as an as a matter of just the exertion of a few people's influence over public life\nExist on a scale that makes K Street look trivial and and so I think one of the big things that I actually wanted to do with the book was to I'm not only change how the public thinks about who would outsource to change too but give journalists a new vocabulary\nFor thinking about I'm ... and I I have to say I'm very happy that this is already happening with or without my book which is when ... gave 'em made his announcement\nTwo billion dollars um to give the homeless in education\nUm it was probably the first mega entrant into this big plants everything in some years I'm In a lot of people who've been waiting for the biggest fortune in the world like what's he going to do what's he gonna do it was there was there was there was a kind of anticipation and I I Would say\nAnd that the general response was different\nFrom previous times it was not just back down to the lord there was some of that and there was a lot of yeah but he doesn't pay as workers enough and yeah but he doesn't\nLike that was baked that wasn't day one coverage right I Know because I got a lot of those phone calls on day one convert from reporters on deadline or don't have a lot of time\nThat was in their head on day one that is progress and a lot of criticism was written in the ensuing ten days or so and then he came back and he said\nWe're raising our wages to Fifteen dollars an hour because we listen to critics now turns out they also cut productivity bonuses and stock options so you know I'm so it was well he's on he's on a journey\nAnd he's on the early part of the journey we're not there yet to answer the kid's question um but I think there is something happening where we're starting to learn that when you hear Richmond giving money away you think you you shop with questions I'm not thanks\nSo this all begs the question of how do we check this philanthropy how do we ah entice these organizations on these individuals to have more civic minded or\nSponsorship as a cake you ET life's dream come from in the knee sleep world featuring temper ... temper memory foam can provide personalized comfort join him to help the night's sleep by reducing motion transfer and responding to users unique shape weight and temperature learn more at least ... dot com\nA state that it seems the public doesn't necessarily trust or organizations in those organizations that are able to both deal with social failure and markets are traditionally meaning government\nAt a time when we're seeing that there's also a great deal of distrust of the government of those who are within the political realm it are there other structures institutions where should we be looking other then of course as you suggest\nOur ability as a society to organize around issues create movements but but where do we channel that that uh if you have thought about it and I'm sure you have\nA you know I think that the government is like\nYour dysfunctional family okay you don't eat Thanksgiving alone in a McDonald's 'cause you have a dysfunctional family you eat it with your dysfunctional family and you try to make it a little less dysfunctional and we'll get that when it comes to our family but we bail like chickens\nWhen our government is dysfunctional um yeah our government is dysfunctional right now but I don't make a couple of points one I Know a lot of people who use Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump as an alibi for not being civic\nWell it turns out we actually have Ninety thousand government entities in the United states of America and as far as I can tell those guys control three\nOut of the Ninety thousand I Know a lot of people who care a lot about criminal justice who have no idea what's going on in their local da races local judge ships right I I Know a lot of people who are very excited to be senators would never think of being a county executive\nAnd you know this world well there's ... and and so I think we have to accept the fact that we are in an age in which civic life isn't a bad state\nWe have to also recognize that subject lives in a bad state because I'm very money to interest on talking about worked in a concerted way to put it in a bad state starting the Nineteen seventies to push deregulation push for tax cuts for rich people they created a world in which\nPrimordial either expect it um and that's the end of my king George\nOkay well I was going to say you know maybe we should renamed Yahoo you should already natural urge and I'll read this truth ... reports\nOn believable so and invite her ear okay the ah wherever it is it's in charge of the programming should invite her [noise]\nUm [noise] here's a question from a Susan Lucas and she asks or any of the billionaire philanthropist focusing on quote economic inequality and persistent poverty in the U.S multigenerational in other words are the folks that you're being critical of\nActually doing something to raise taxes support the common good strength and civic life and actually undermine their um their ability to make ...\nSamples you know I'm for example if you look at the people who fund ProPublica mhm I mean there's some small dollar people but there's also some bigger people\nThat is not the kind of that's not like the self dealing kind of giving that I'm taking that's a very little benefit to a rich person right\nThe best they can happen to good to Republicans that they're not going to touch anybody you know the words that can happen is going to investigate everybody you know if you're a very rich person says and that's the kind of giving that makes the system better that holds people to account the benefits which flow into civic life\nYou know there are people out here in California who who have done a philanthropic work trying to improve the quality of the census count right there's this mechanism where\nPrivate people can suggest to the government addresses that the government is unlikely to count properly someone living on a mattress on a roof the government's not going to have that listed but if you tell them that there is someone living on that roof on a mattress than they were added to the database now count it right and so there's folks who fund clipboard\nWalk around which are very labor intensive do that that's again you're not doing that to benefit yourself as a rich person you're not putting your name on a library you're doing that because you actually want to enhance the count and by the way if we count more foreign vulnerable people that's going to hurt you on balance right that's more of your tax dollars go into more people\nBut you are you would argue that it would help you overall because you're strengthening your democratic system is yet ride your ...\nIt may not help the nearest and I actually try to stay away from these like when when like but it's still good for the long run it may not be good for you it's still the right thing to do\nYes but are you arguing in fact that ah that the health of our society and the health of our democracy actually relies on not a cutting out yeah OK health overall I'm not talking about but sometimes that\nMeans in the lord and lady Grantham don't get to live in a casket anymore you know and that that's better for the society is but it's not better for lord and lady Grantham that's a but it still may be the right thing for them to push 'em and so then when you look at someone\nLike although they may not be strung up in the end I mean that also is probably good for lord and lady faster you move\nRight yeah and ... but let's turn it around to take someone like ... how could he shift from the bad side of this of the good sides so he now he's very early in this two billion dollars a billion for homeless in civilian for education the preschool is going to be\nFocused on the customer like Amazon so I guess you can\nReturn your education within two weeks or less [laughter] [noise] um [noise] and it comes to an or if it's huge unnecessary boxing with those puffy plastic things\nI'm so a lot of what he announced it's fine it's but it's symptoms treatment right um it's not dealing with the root causes of poverty around the quality of helping some poor kids don't get good educations\nHelping some homeless families in Seattle\nFine nothing objectionable people will be helped but how could he get to a place of the kind of given you're talking about dealing with civic life solving things at the root and so first of all when you employ people the way they do with Amazon\nOr you contribute to homelessness and inequality in poverty you know so\nThe first thing I often say to these folks as\nFirst don't ask what you can do for your country that's what you've done to your country okay at first stop doing the things that you've done\nThat or ... something like let's stop the bleeding first right um because if you're helping over here but you're still blood letting it's not that helpful and stop what you're doing and then and then if he were to ask okay well what can I Do how can I give more transformative Lee let's take one issue\nHe made his money because of a glitch in history\nWhich is that the labor union movement was very weak as the Internet was rising if unions had been where they were Thirty years ago when Amazon started it wouldn't be what it was he wouldn't be worth a hundred and sixty billion dollars he and I'm not saying he created that reality because he didn't quite that reality he\nMade use of that reality but that was just a historical fact\nAnd probably in twenty Thirty years we will have figured out new ways to protect workers that's my ... but in the period that he happened to make\nA hundred and sixty billion dollars it's hard to think about that fortune having been made if workers have more bargaining power the model is built on how little bargaining power workers happened to have in that period okay so you say okay I'm going to given a transformative way I got a hundred and sixty billion with a beat to play with\n'em imagine if he said okay I Can't change what I did I have some regrets about it I'm willing to defend it in other ways but I Want to invest billions of dollars in the future of worker power in this country right I Want to\nSponsorship as a cake you eighty life's dream come true for men to any sleep world featuring temp repeat ac temper memory song can provide personalized comfort you when you have to help the night's sleep by reducing motion transfer and responding to users unique shape weight and temperature learn more at ... dot com\nSome bargaining power have benefits and I understand that if I succeed over here in this philanthropic work it's going to raise the cost of doing business for Amazon it actually may hurt Amazon\nMight a hundred and I mean remember it a lot of his wealth is still stuck my hundred and sixty billion dollars may go down more from the devaluation of my stock them from getting money away but that\nI think would be real giving yeah it would be as a as a New York times writer I we did a piece where he wrote about my book and what it would mean basis and the way for our mind you summarized it was Jeff ... given away that make sure there's never another Jeff Bass is right\nAnd ... you know we're in this global reality right so let's assume or let's hope that maybe Jeff Bezos takes this takes debate ... sees the light moves in this direction\nAnd somebody in Beijing at Penn center Ali Baba says there's an opening I don't have labor laws that are going to require me to do these types of things I can\nQuickly fill in that very vacuum or in a non democratic society where there are no labor laws and uh and take advantage of the globalized\nA weakness of a system that protects individuals and in their case doesn't protect the citizens of its own society\nThat we should write better trade laws okay so and and and and that's what trade looking for\nAnd again I mean like a lot of things I'm Trump says you know there's like a five percent truth in it and then the remaining nine Ninety five percent is less true than anybody who's ever used the English language and even people who haven't used it well the way he can't\nAnd you know but there's actually a kernel of truth that was ignored by people on both sides of the aisle yeah the trade was not working for many people and the Chinese for example\nAre much better than us at like looking at their society and getting what they want from Trent arrangements than we are like for my favorite example of this is the Chinese made this deal where\nBasically you want to be a foreign company operating in China you have to work with local partner what's it kind of weird requirement well it's actually kind of genius requirement you know why\nYou you called every company in the world to creating a mentorship program for your entire like executive core and you force the world's companies or they want to come to your country to train like\nTwo hundred thousand executives over a period of years right that's really that's not free trade that smart trade yeah and we could be much more creative and actually saying hey if you explain your workers\nYou don't get access to this market all of this policy this is what I mean by changing things at the root for everybody\nBut in the same way and I'm going to just follow up on this but in the same way that you're suggesting that American billionaires and corporations have essentially a ticket you have state capture has captured the state\nHaving we now because of these weaknesses these marketers these social failures how we arrived at a point where in fact other countries to have been able and other corporations that are global\nCaptured the state to prevent the types of policies that maybe Donald Trump is promoting but in practical actual fact are going to be very difficult to get him flows I I'm not suggesting we shouldn't try but it while you're at it they mentioned\nAnother great place for philanthropic efforts what it's going to win Citizens United has to be one of the great priorities for anybody who loves his country getting rid of it and that's not going to be easy that's a project of building movements of\nBut that's an issue by the way wherever you sell it right there's a lot of people in the right average people who do not like the idea of companies run in Washington right right that's ... that's an area where the rights actually divided against itself\nWell speaking of big companies are Joel who works at Google a ... a
