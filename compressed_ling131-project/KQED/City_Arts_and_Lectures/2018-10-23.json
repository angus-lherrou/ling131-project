Sacramento it's eight o'clock\n[noise]\nWelcome to world affairs the weekly broadcast of the world affairs counsel I'm Jane whales your host\nThe role of us leadership around the world is changing and they're very views about the consequences what does it mean for trade for climate change for nonproliferation for war and peace and unstable regions joining us to share his views as Nicholas Burns of the Harvard Kennedy School of government\nAmbassador burns was the U.S ambassador to NATO and the ambassador of ... he also served his spokes men at the state department and later as under secretary of state for political affairs for full disclosure we were colleagues on the national Security Council\nThis broadcast has made possible each week I think generally supportive Chevron v M wear and tear Draper Richard caplin foundation\nI wanted to start in Ecuador question I'm where I'm going to ask you to translate because foreign service officers can translate from any language and uh uh hadn't had that the opening of the of the United Nations General assembly President Trump said that\nThe United states now has a doctrine of ... I'm a patriot has some\nYou know patriotism his love of country and doctrine is afraid of guiding principles what does it mean to have a doctor and patriotism\nFaced with a softball question I'm Guy say first\nIt's a real pleasure to be with Jane How we're friends we've been friends for a long time we work together and government I greatly respect the work she's done here in San Francisco the bay area I should say on the world affairs counsel so thank you and I'm from Boston grew up there a member of\nRed Sox nation we're feeling really good about ourselves you know it doesn't matter if the red Sox win the world series we defeated the Yankees that's all that [noise] probably outweigh the San Franciscans feel about the Dodgers so you can understand [noise] um and I also wanted to say I'm\nA looking forward to a good conversation tonight it's a really important time for us I think it's a dangerous time and this was a ... good opening question and I'm not going to mince words all of us are patriotic\nI mean everybody I Know who lives in this country love our country [noise] uh and there are times when you have to defend it come hell or high water and there are times when you have to be critical because that's being patriotic\nI think the founding fathers and mothers would have expected of us that if things are going right in our democracy we stand up in a civil and peaceful way and hopefully in a respectful way and we give our voices in in criticism\nAnd so if I could translate Donald Trump the United nations two weeks ago I think what he really is he's practicing nationalism not patriotism\nAnd nationalism um it can be appropriate it also can be perverse it couldn't be\nWere better than you are we're better than anybody else um\nAnd to me America First or the way she is\nAnd to me America First uh the way he's articulated it in a way he's practiced said it's a very negative force in our society gets ... it pushes people away\nAnd a time of real integration in the world where our economy is integrated\nAround the world where the biggest problems I think that our kids especially are going to face when we hand off the baton and we're handing out right now to our kids are the trends national issues like climate change and trafficking of women and the threat of pandemics these are\nAll problems that require us to be working across our borders building coalitions and you know when I worked for the two Bush is President George H W and President George W or Bill Clinton\nThey were coalition builders and they understood that President George W. Bush to understood that Thirty years ago President Reagan understood it and to go back to a nationalist platform where everything has to be about us and we're not going to work with other countries in Justin Trudeau is become public enemy number one [noise] you know this is a I don't think we're heading in the right direction\nRight right so if if this is kind of a fancy way to say America First on sometimes America only and one of his last given latest expression in the area of trade\nYeah I'm at President Trump pulled out of out of turns partnership which was twelve Asian countries had excluded China\nUm but some of our closest ally ... Japan et cetera\nMove forward without us yeah al ... followed it as how is now where the ones that out in the south China is not ... was that a movement that turned out to be in our interest\nNo of course not I mean I think that the the Trans Pacific partnership forty percent of global GDP in the countries that were had already signed up to the twelfth countries as as you said um that was our big power moves against China because China has been manipulating its currency\nNot playing on a level playing field on trade\nViolating its commitments under the world Trade Organization China needed to be held to account for that\nThe way to do it wants to get the countries of our hemisphere and if you just think about our hemisphere as Canada the United states and Mexico and Peru in Colombia and she lives very much western hemisphere with some of the big countries in Asia like Japan\nOr that was that was our moved to force China to conform to to play fair and to abide by the rules and when the president pulled us out it gave China major break the Chinese couldn't believe that they\nReceived this gift in the first week of the administration so I think that the president's notion that he rejects all multilateral trade agreements\nAnd they've lifted a lot of boats over the last forty or fifty years they've not only made us prosperous they've made lots of other countries prosperous [noise] um I think it was a mistake\nUm the idea that you could take apart NAFTA we need to modernize NAFTA NAFTA was the world of Nineteen Ninety three Ninety four so I Do get modernizing NAFTA I thought the way he did it was unnecessarily future lipstick with Canada especially but also with Mexico [noise] let me say something in his defense however\nHe's right to go after the Chinese and to stand up to them and what I've noticed just traveling I was in I think I've been seven European countries in the last couple of months\nUm is the Europeans are quietly cheering on Donald Trump and many of the Asian countries are in taking on China I I this this trade war is is is a little bit tricky\nYou don't want to take it so far into the future and and that you want them numbers to add up so much that it begins to hurt our economy but I think making the point to the Chinese is they have to be accountable and they have to adhere to rules is a good one and I think Donald Trump has a lot of the world behind him now that he is fixed\nOf sorts we can't call it NAFTA anymore [laughter]\nThe U.S Canada Mexico or U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement [noise] he's made up with the European Union\nWe don't have a fix right now with the European Union but we've agreed on a non aggression packed with him on trade [noise] he's made up with the Japanese and South Koreans so he's kind of cleared the decks and I think that's the right thing for him to do [noise] um we have to defend ourselves on trade a lot of Americans have lost jobs\nIn key parts of our country because the Chinese have not been fair and and I do think he's the presence right to do this\nSo we're now in a fallout trade war with China yeah um\nAnd and I think the question is will this imposition of terrorists uh our American consumers heard we heard in our own economy or is that reaction to a real life problem a lot less damaging to us as well to them\nWell there's no question that some industries some parts of the farm belt are going to be hurt by a prolonged trade war with China you have to calculate if you're the U.S trade representative Robert Lighthizer he's a very smart guy\nOr certainly the president's got to calculate how far do you take it I don't think the Chinese they're so self confident now and she's in paying has so much riding on his own economic agenda he's not gonna case\nSo the end of this is going to be some kind of a win win solution hopefully after the Chinese have made commitments to us and to the rest of the world that would repair some of their very injurious trade practices you know I'm someone who does not want to make China into an enemy\nAnd I think there's a lot we had we need to do with China as partners as well as competitors and we're both with China\nBut I Do agree on trade at the time has come to stand up to the\nRight and it's as partners ... North Korea is a great example of the ... the Chinese yeah very definitely do so on and I I guess I part of me wants to ask you in fact I Will ask him [laughter]\nSponsorship the cake you eat the live stream thanks Sandy from ... extended Internet delivers in home life by for ultimately has been the home need\nBy all the fall of the Soviet Union prudent infamously I think said the greatest catastrophe the twentieth century was the fall of the Soviet Union most of us would say the greatest\nTriumph or one of them of the twentieth century and foreign policy was the fall of the Soviet Union but they feel humiliated by it they were one of the two strongest powers in the world they're clearly not now China is\nIn every metric of power economic political soft power military power China is vastly superior they've passed the Russians\nThe Russia's GDP is about what Spain's GDP is this is not a super power except for the dimension of space and nuclear weapons they feel humiliated by that loss and I think it does drive by shooting you know why did he go into Syria during the refugee crisis of the autumn of two thousand Fifteen three years ago it really wasn't\nTo advance all of Russia's interest they wanted to retain their naval base there I think it was to cut the U.S down to size\nShow that the U.S maybe President Obama hesitated\nHe hesitated big time in Syria he couldn't quite make up his mind what he wanted to do including saw weakness\nAnd decided I Want to take advantage I'm going to humiliate the United states\nWhich in many ways as what he's done he's become the king pin Syria we're falling from grace\nWe no longer have that influence that all of our presidents had from really Richard Nixon to the second term uh Brock Obama President Obama for a lot of reasons and we can argue whether he was right or not I think he was probably wrong\nDecided that the lesson he learned from our ill fated in interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan don't enter the middle east but\nWith twelve million homeless people twelve million homeless out of a population of twenty\nPollutants our weakness and decided I Want to take advantage I'm going to humiliate the United states\nWhich in many ways as what he's done he's become the king pin Syria we're falling from grace we no longer have that influence that all of our presidents had from really Richard Nixon to the second term of rock Obama President Obama for a lot of reasons we can argue whether he was right or not I think he was probably wrong\nDecided that the lesson he learned from our ill fated in interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan don't enter the middle east but\nWith twelve million homeless people twelve million homeless out of a population of twenty two point four million in Syria [noise] ah it's been a catastrophe and I'm not saying we should have put a hundred thousand American troops in but could we have put\nCould we have set up I'm safe zones\nOn the Jordanian Turkish borders at least protect that some of the refugees we could have done this militarily without exposing our soldiers to too much harm it would have been risky in many ways [noise]\nUm and so potent took advantage of that and I think that was part of the calculation that he can't really compete with us but he wants to block us and he wants to diminish us as part of his calculation\n[noise] um he had had an experience with us in in a in the case of um of Libya where at and they\nThere was a situation where there was a civil war\nQuestion is do we intervene and we chose to intervene in that case and\nAnd the nation changed very fast yeah found a responsibility to protect\nInnocent civilians the innocent civilians to regime change yeah that was on the face and I'm just Pasadena she didn't tell me I'm wrong for Russia an ally of like the ad to let that happen\nHad it happened again in Syria had we entered and found for regime change our had at the Russians kind of given us a green light to take action wouldn't credibility is an ally be gone to an around\nYeah it is so that you remember that the intervention in Libya and two thousand eleven was actually authorized by the United Nations Security council Russia ... NATO that\nRush out to be told to NATO operation the Russians decided not to veto because we had made the argument to the United states France and Britain\nThat there were thousands of civilians that could be massacred by Gadhafi in Benghazi and at the United nations had to um NATO had to go in and blessed by the un to protect him that was the mission\nAnd we accomplish that mission we prevented a humanitarian disaster in that first phase of the Libya operation but then when NATO got in\nNATO essentially decided and mainly led by the Europeans by the way this was not President Obama he wanted prime minister Cameron in President Sarkozy to lead they did they wanted to go after coffee and destroy his regime and and the Russians felt betrayed that they felt that they had failed and they decided not to block\nThis mission because it was ... and they didn't know it would be regime change and so um I think the Russians probably have a point there it's a minor debating point in my view but they have a point\nYou want to get to the larger question whether we are right to expand NATO\nThank you I Would [laughter] you store it was a time when they were doing a\nRussia policy um and and the national Security Council and did it turn out to be the right choice\nThink it did I I worked for President George W. Bush Condi Rice and I were the two person Soviet team in the last two years of the Cold War\nSo I was actually on December twenty fifth Nineteen Ninety One Christmas Day\nWas the no take her on the phone from my home in Virginia and ... when President Bush wish Gorbachev farewell saw the end of the Soviet Union and masterful masterful worker President Bush and secretary James Baker\nI mean I think two of the finest public servants I ever worked for I admire both of them so much\nThey were able to convince Gorbachev to end the Cold War peacefully\nThey were able to engineer the unification of Germany without a shot being fired how many people would have bet on that\nDay the wall came down on November Nine thirty nine and did that within ten months of the wall coming down\nI'm just in Berlin last week our daughter one of our daughters lives in Berlin\nUm you know went to the Brandenburg Gate is as well pass the time now but it's still dramatic to think about what happened there were so skillful in handling Gorbachev President Bush and President Clinton I worked for him for two years in that same job where so skillful\nIn trying to make Russia into a partner of the United states\nAnd for a number of years you know we didn't plan on expanding NATO we thought we could live with Russia as a partner with Russia had a chance to become a democratic country Russia was a democratic country from Nineteen Ninety or the end of Ninety One until maybe Ninety six Ninety seven but that democracy melted\nAnd the economy imploded and all the people on fixed incomes ended up living in poverty\nA and corruption set in and a lot of the advice that we gave them we have to take some responsibility for this you know how to your transition from a command economy to a market economy when we went we said shock therapy well about thirty Russians got fabulously wealthy they turn out to be the ... sharks\nAnd all that most Russians suffered and by the by Ninety six Ninety seven Ninety eight we concluded in the Clinton Administration that Russian democracy was failing as was going to fail there was a big strategic vacuum and central Europe all the countries that have been part of the Warsaw Pact\nPoland and the Czech Republic and Slovakia and hungry and Slovenia in Romania and Bulgaria and particularly the three Baltic states Estonia laughing\nBut the ship that the cake you weedy life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with a steady on demand\nThey were not part of NATO or the European Union and we feared that if a ... leader came back in Moscow and he came back in Nineteen Ninety nine named Vladimir vote and she that person were quickly quickly want to consolidate control of the east of Eastern Europe\nAnd a lot of us felt I was not alive\nIn the spring of Nineteen forty five when an ailing FDR and Churchill\nMade this cruel deal with Stalin that he would effectively control Yalta Eastern Europe we were in power position in Nineteen Ninety five Nineteen Ninety six Nineteen Ninety seven we could redeem that\n[noise] nature compromise that FDR in church will made at the end of the second World War and these people about a hundred and Fifteen million people in all these countries could become free\nForever and all of them joined a you and all of them join NATO and I'm so happy to this day that we expanded NATO up to the Russian border because if we hadn't putting would be an stony and laugh yet today\nAnd he'd be an aggressor in Eastern Europe and we'd be back to where we were at the end of the second World War\nAnd I think what you you hear I'm very clearly is in the defense of extending expanding NATO to include a central Europe and and and the argument I thought it was the right to say yeah yeah [noise]\nWhat is where some folks fall away is stopping at the Russian border and I know we had the partnership for peace fat yeah their argument is look at what we did after World War two with Germany\nI'm a law there is an isolated defeated nation in fact you you you put it in the midst of um as a larger international order in which we have more in common than in conflict\nYou know we felt a principal I ... and it's interesting who's president I'm Bill Clinton President George W. Bush and President Obama all agreed on this strategy they all expanded NATO\nAnd they all supported the expansion of the European Union this took place\nHe he when she was at a very weak moment in her coalition politics he sought to undermine or he's also attacked chancellor of prime minister may is this a male ... is this does have a problem with strong female leaders [noise]\nI think the evidence he's trying to be ... by saying that I think he does\nAnd and she is Chancellor Merkel is the leading small D democratic standing up for human rights and democracy what we believe in and our presidents trying to under cutter it is absolutely it's outrageous that an American presidents during this I mean Jane we go all the way back\nTo every president we've worked for Jimmy Carter is where I started none of our presidents\nThat the cardinal rule was we're gonna disagree with our allies in private that was Ronald Reagan's rule that was Richard Nixon's for all\nThat was George W Bush's wrote his name three Republicans and and President Trump's role as I'm going to be extremely offensive to our best friends and I'm going to suck up and embrace our enemies I don't get it\nAnd it and it's not right and the Europeans are watching this and they were appalled by it and I'm appalled as an American citizen that he\nDoes seem to think that the the smartest stride ha with an autocrat as to flatter them does he does have a point at all no [laughter]\nI think if you talk to them I mean I Wish we could have George Shultz here who lives in this great city\nNinety seven year old George Schultz who's there's an amazing person I think I don't want to put words in his mouth but I I've learned from him I've learned for secretary Baker I've learned from ... writes I've learned from Madeleine Albright Hillary Clinton Colin Powell all of our great secretaries of state I think we're all of them would say is\nOf course you want to establish relationship even with an autocratic leader in a negotiation but we need to be tough and clear with those leaders we you know being nice to them is not going to work\n[noise] so so let me take his you know keep keep on our relationship with Europe right now um [noise]\nYou know based on a set of norms based on a set of institutions all of us we built an advanced cars have\nAdvanced our economic and security interest for a while as as there is um [noise]\nWe we've always been a viable partner are real interest are always taken into account on the understanding that there as well as well right now as you look at that last set of relationships and that with with your with European countries with and with Europe it as a as an ACL any you\nUm are they trying to figure out\nHow to work with President Trump and that's very changed environmental are they not trying to figure out okay how do we work without President Trump how do we work I shouldn't say how do we work with the United states as a major ally in a major force\nI think most of these European countries are allies including Japan and South Korea the stray earlier most of them are trying to work with ... mad is\nUm you know we're going to have a Seventy eighth anniversary of NATO in April for two thousand Nineteen and NATO's not going to have a summit meeting\nBecause and here's why they won't say this but I Know it's because they have no idea what President Trump would say he might decide the alliance and you know and all of our presidents have held these summits at every single one of our presidents and on the fiftieth and sixtieth anniversary we had some is in Washington\nCan't trust the president so I think most of the government's trying to work at the cabinet level there's deep respect for Madison ... around the world um there was deep respect for general McMaster as well I think there's a lot of respect for Vassar Nikki Haley who's amounts yesterday she is stepping down\nUm you know so I didn't mention John Bolton ah because I don't think there is that kind of respect for John Bolton um and so this is a problem for us\nIn some on some issues climate change\nI think the Europeans the Japanese are trying to work with your great governor here\nAnd when Michael Bloomberg and with American NGOs and with our governor Charlie Baker Republican in Massachusetts He's for doing something about climate change and Governor Brown is of course yeah you're a great governor assignment governor Jerry Brown so um they see the power of California frankly your state\nWould you be the fifth or sixth largest economy if your sex and it's an extraordinary thing\nAnd they see that at the grassroots level the great majority of Americans agree with signs of the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change [noise] agree that we have to be part of the solution agree that we can't opt out there are a hundred and Ninety five nation states in the un there are a hundred and Ninety four signatories for the Paris Agreement one country\nThe second largest carbon emitters out so I think what's gonna happen whenever President Trump believes office whether it's twenty twenty or twenty twenty four or you know whatever whether whether he resigns\nI think the government's will come back quickly the other governments to work with his successor 'cause I'll have no alternative given our power in the world I just wonder about average people in Germany\nOr Japan\nUm and they look at us\nSponsorship the cake you eat the live stream thanks Sandy from ... ... than it Internet delivers in home life by for ultimately has been the home\nSorry you're on your own we're just going to put money into call and we're going to really keep burning coal and that is offensive to a lot of people in Europe I was in Germany last week I as I told you the number one issue for most German citizens when you look out the world is climate change\nMaybe the number one issue for most Americans in the polls is terrorism for dominance climate and we sent them a pretty tough signal I don't think that comes back and in both issues we need one another we do and if you look at the if you haven't read the Pew poll and the Chicago Council Paul's they both came out last week they're extraordinary polls\nThey show that for the Americans Republicans Democrats and all fifty states surveyed\nThe American people at Seventy six percent believe in NATO\nThe American people believe in trade the American people believe in immigration and refugee is because we're an immigrant nation they believe that we should be standing up for a democracy everything that President Trump hasn't done it's almost been a reaction in the American falls against what he said\nAnd the public opinion polls overseas we are at our lowest point in recorded history\nOn the credibility of the United states and in Germany more people trust potent than trust Trump and Germany as an allied nation so we're in a deep hole in terms of our credibility in the world\nThere's another issue beyond climate and others we've talked about and that's Iran\nThey're a the nuclear deal as a multilateral deal I European allies for a a part of it not only did we withdraw from the nuclear deal but we are exercising our rights as secondary sanctions\nFirst describe a secondary sanctions are I don't know if they if they are new with that deal or they exist in other agreements I'm\nPlaying out right yeah so I mean as Jane knows I was George W. Bush and Condi Rice's around negotiator or we didn't get to the negotiating table we mainly sanction the Iranians are when President Obama and and our good friend Wendy Sherman who was a real heroin here\nWe're able to negotiate the Iran nuclear agreement of two thousand Fifteen I I very much supported them I testified before Congress I'm supporting President Obama I thought I didn't think it was a\nI didn't think it was a slam dunk there are a lot of things about the deal that bothered me but like any do you have to kind of way the positive negative I thought it was kind of a sixty forty fifty five forty five in favor but I saw the downside [noise]\nUm but what what's that deal did was they were furious to a nuclear weapon through uranium enrichment and through plutonium processing\nWe force the Iranians to dismantle the industrial processes that set up and we could be absolutely sure that for Fifteen to Twenty years into the future passed two thousand Fifteen they were not going to be able to build a nuclear weapon for me that was good enough\n'cause you know you had to assume that the country might change their country not so much regime change just change between now and then in twenty thirty so I thought it was a mistake for President Trump to get out because um he's not replacing it with anything\nAnd if he drives around into a corner they may go back illegally to try to develop a nuclear weapon then we're going to be back into the choice of whether we fight them or go back to negotiate we've already ... to ...\n... is it illegal for them to cut and they simply say look the U.S pulled out it's no longer viable deal\nWell under international under us sanctions have been re impose\nUnder the nonproliferation agreement of of Nineteen sixty eight\nIs illegal for any country to develop nuclear weapons outside the five countries the permanent members of Security Council United States the United kingdom France\nThen the Soviet Union a and China it's illegal for anybody to have nuclear weapons and and that we should honor that treaty and we shouldn't want to do anything that would allow countries to try to head down that road secondary sanctions so not only did we leave the Iran agreement in April\nOf two thousand this year which I thought was a mistake but I'm I don't I didn't get a vote on this one I'm the president decided who imposed secondary sanctions on our allies\nWho negotiated in good faith with us over ten years", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "23"}
