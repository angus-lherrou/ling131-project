San Francisco and take you we I north highland Sacramento the time is eight PM\nFrom cake you read the public radio in San Francisco you're listening to walls and bridges a special series of conversations from cake you B.D exploring some of the most polarizing topics of our time I'm Jeremy Siegel\nZIP Code is much more than just a five digit number most obviously it tells you where to send postage where a person lives and works\nBut the impact of that number can reach far beyond geographic location it can reveal inequality and the likelihood of upward mobility in different locations and medical professionals have begun to consider ZIP Code is an indicator of health wellbeing and even life expectancy\nIn today's program we'll hear a panel of experts to discuss whether it zipped code can determine a person's faith in\nThe program was recorded on may seventh after baby you opera house in San Francisco\nIn conversation where Dr Tony ... senior vice president for healthy communities at the California down then David J Harding professor of sociology at UC Berkeley and the Leila butler associate director of policy wake here's our host for tonight's program Katie Silicon Valley bureau chief Tanya mostly [noise]\nSo I start off by talking a little bit about this idea as ours dip code and the premise of the big idea that our ship coat can determine our fate and a\nDoctor in researching for tonight um I found a lot of work\nA lot of research a pending down counties and ZIP codes but your word finds that we can do even more granular even more narrower and see disparities block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood can you expand upon that [noise]\nYeah um and again thanks for having me\nOr you know your ZIP Code is more important than your genetic code when it comes to your house that was the catchy slogan that a number of us developed a number of years ago and the reasons we say chips ZIP Code in genetic code is 'cause it's a catchy slogan\nBut the reality is you can go down so much below ZIP codes and we went down to the census tracks or in Alameda County and then around the entire state in fact we've looked at every since distracted in California\nUm to see significant differences between census tracts are more proxies of neighborhoods you can see significant differences between neighborhoods or even contiguous neighborhoods and the same city in Oakland for instance\nThere's a twenty two year life expectancy difference between the flat land in the hills and when when we ran that entire analysis for the bay area we could actually\nTell people that twelve twelve thousand five hundred dollars of household income buys you a year of life or in the San Francisco bay area for each additional twelve thousand five hundred dollars of household income so we started telling people\nYou should bring this kind of data when you're negotiating a race I mean you literally I should say hey boss I Need a couple more years\nTo life here you know show me we laugh at that but the ...\nYou know show me we laugh at this but the reality is that that many people don't have that privilege to be able to ask for that um and many of these areas that you're talking about\nUm this comes for you um this work you're at a place where you've been studying this for many years but the genesis for you really came early on 'em you actually were raised in Canada is that correct and it was and you came to the United states and you said what the heck\nLike what's going on here and can you just tell us a little bit about some of those disparities that you saw right away\nYeah so I'm a very simple person in my life story was pretty straightforward I grew up in Canada in Montreal Canada it's it's a wonderful city that hosted the Olympic Games and the international world's fair and as universal healthcare and universal childcare and subsidize postsecondary education\nUm and paid leave for everybody it's it's a very civilized country that investments people\nAnd that's the status the caviar as the investment\nThat that the investment and I I did notice the time I assumed all western developed countries invested in people\nOr so when I had a choice of going to medical school I went to Johns Hopkins medical school which is in east Baltimore, Maryland and landed in Baltimore in east Baltimore and was literally shocked and I was being toured around by an upper class among\nMany others look good for shock on my face and he said what's what's wrong with you in all I could manage to stand my aunt was when was there a war here because I couldn't understand there were blown up houses burned out\nCars up on ... mangy\nDogs running around and be playing in and amongst all of this and I'll never forget what he said to me because it's it it set me on a career trajectory that took me to where I Am today he said to me with this look of disdain he said what you expect it to the inner city\nAnd I thought so I'm the idiot I should have expected this blight\nI should have known that this is a norm\nIn the United states because where I grew up you don't have inner city\nBut in this country you have inner cities and so I was I was on the trajectory medical school because I felt like I was being asked to do an absurd things I was bringing us to treat social ills\nWith pills and it made very little sense to me and so that's sort of what led me to do these analyses that show these ridiculous life expectancy jobs in some cities the United states is Thirty years between neighborhoods in the same city\nAnd those are places typically the south typically the east\nAnd the south east the mid west everywhere we've looked we've looked at over thirty cities now everywhere we flipped we've never found a life expectancy difference from the same city less than fifty years\nIn some cases over Thirty years this is the American pattern and it's it's uniquely American not that you don't have differences in other parts of the world you don't have the extremes\nThat you have in America elsewhere in the developed\nWorld you're shaking your head and I'm your work has taken you to these spaces as well and these disparities that we see a really at the granular level um\nWhen you think about some of the things that you do on the ground what are some of the things that you see out there some of the disparities that impact specifically here in the bay area\nWell I'm One of the things I just wanted to say is that I always I'm really\nI'm reticent about talking after Tony heightened because he always\nIs a bad stories and break it down so easily so\nUm but every time it always reminds me that something that I grew up with something that was normal for me was is actually not normal our expectations are actually not um this expectation that the inner city where people live that that's I'm just that way\nThat's actually not where we should be operating that there is a way to get out of it and so that was the work that's what drove me to my work\nUm when we think about some of the things that we see and how it plays out um in communities\nI think you put it so eloquently when you said you know if you have access to a park safe place to be active if you have access to healthy food if you have access to quality education or if you can easily get to work or contribute in your community then you're going to be healthier\nAnd we see that play out in many communities where um we're working where the opposite is happening where there's a lack of access to these important resources these opportunities the opportunity to live are full of life and to contribute and it has a deep impact on health and it actually has an impact on society overall\nUm because when we know that ... you know our fates are inextricably linked we are all connected\nAnd so how we treat folks that um are experiencing the most inequities in our communities and that it speaks volumes to\nHow we treat everyone in a society and how we can benefit most is by thinking about and working closely with people who had a deep that in the center of those\nUm inequities people who are dealing with these um challenges and have been cut off from opportunity day to day to ask what are the solutions in order to change this around so that we too can benefit\nI'm In the ways that people are benefiting in Montreal and living healthy lives\nBut one thing I'm hearing you say um is that we have to have a certain sense of connective ness with each other and empathy and perhaps in this country capitalism and this idea of pulling yourself from your bootstraps and every man for himself\nHave set up a culture where we're not thinking of each other that way um I like to bring you and David\nWe're not thinking of each other that way um I like to bring you in David ... thoughts on this idea of the root of the disparities that we see\nShore yeah I mean I think we definitely have a very individualistic culture here in the U.S ah and so we tend to attribute people's outcomes and experiences to choices they've made and sort of ignore the larger structures of things we're talking about and I think\nWe're really talking if we're talking about the amount of concentrated poverty we have in the U.S and US cities but also in rural areas\nWe're talking about poverty and we're talking about race like that is what are the way this country has dealt with race in our history of racial oppression and domination is what is what led us to this point I'm\nGoing to say one thing about capitalism because I it's a question that comes up a lot and I just like to point out that you know sweetness a capitalist country Denmark has capitals country Finland Norway Canada\nUm communities in Atlanta um you know they took a neighborhood that was really in the sort of extreme\nNinety nine percent of all the adversity that you could think of crime you know high school dropouts social services foster care\nEverything was going wrong and they you know they they basically tore down the housing and they built a mixed um income um village really with uh amenities and it was very attractive and they've seen\nAll of those districts reverse themselves and they've done it in multiple parts of the country so it's it's clearly doable it word but the question is\nWill we invest enough money to build housing at scale to be able to address the scale of the problem that we're facing in California were about a million and a half units short of where we need to be\nAnd you know we're falling behind the by about a hundred thousand units a year so you know on in terms of scale and there was an effort recently in the legislature to\nSo you know on in terms of scale and there was an effort recently in the legislature to actually change some of the density um zoning that would allow transit hubs to build much higher density and um all the politicians walked away from it because it was a ... year\nSo there are real political issues here people consider this issue is sort of central even colleagues of mine said that these are issues were were Democrats sound like Republicans are because they say well it's up to the market\nUm and so there's a I still think it comes down to this question about human rights you know housing a human right I mean we have people living on the streets\nAre are are we okay with that is that okay because that's not going to go away by us wishing it away it's only going to go away by us investing in housing at a at a very large scale\nTo increase the volume of opportunities for people to be a house and we have to intervene in the market market will not solve this problem\nOr we anywhere close to that there is lots of effort that are happening on the legislative level there's lots of folks on the ground who are working in this vein\nBut there is a terror that a lot of people feel and the day to day and it doesn't feel like they're any solutions that are anywhere near getting to the numbers that you just brought up\nWell LA just has a huge housing bond it's not enough but it's the biggest thing that they've ever done and they're trying to invested in the hot spots in in Los Angeles there's definitely a lot of political interest I think people are afraid during an election year or two kind of raise their head up too high on this issue\nI'm a number of the gubernatorial candidates who suggested that they're very interested in trying to actually get this thing to scale so I'm hopeful that things will happen I think in California there's there's sort of a percolating will to actually address this problem but it's it can't be addressed through the markets alone\nYeah you're shaking your head\nYeah I Know and I mean the conversation right now I think if top of our mind this idea around housing I also thinking about connection to opportunity and um this idea around just access to health foods this idea of really investing in communities in every community\nUm and to to go back to David point about choice in the conversation that sometimes comes up about choice\nI think it's important to talk about what options and the limited trace their is start their first before we talk about um you know I agree with David point before we talk about what choices people are making really start talking about the policies that got us there\nUm and got us to a point where people are living and just invested community so what would it take I think when we all close our eyes and think about what it looks like if we have an equitable society\nWe don't think about having some communities that have been some have not we really think about everyone having access to a helpful community where everybody can live they can drive that can contribute they can have access to opportunity\nAnd so what does it take to invest in order to get us there so when I'm nodding to um a lot of what I'm uh my fellow panelists are talking about it really is this idea of like what does it take to get us\nTo move our politicians to listen to our communities who are just asking for just that give us that those opportunities um does I'm really you know the communities that are healthy and invested in so that people can live their best labs\nYeah I think that I Want to talk to you a little bit about some of the groundwork you dead in the outcomes and some of the um\nThe experiences of the young people that you talk to 'em when we think so much about communities and opportunity we're thinking about the future of the young people who are living in those communities on your work and your research found\nUm really the impacts of violence and poverty overtime for young people tell us a little bit about that\nI worked with and studied a group of boys in three different neighborhoods in Boston are too high poverty neighborhoods and won a low poverty neighborhood which was sort of serve as a comparison and I just started by talking about what their daily lives where like\nWhere did they go who do they interact with why did they do they do those things what were their experience was like\nA and I was kind of naive going and I didn't have this violence in mind I mean I knew that the neighborhoods they lived in where are the most violent ones in the city\nI'm ... but immediately what what what came out was that the way the violence was structured or many many things about their lives um it's structured how they thought about the institutions they came into contact with the experience of being\nUm both living in a in a in a violent neighborhood where you're constantly afraid that you were going to be victimized\nOr and then at the same same time you know having to police come in and sort of turned upside down and put you up against the wall and then that led to a kind of institutional distrust would spread to other institutions you know as many kids said well the teachers at school they're just like the cops\n\nA you know they would see you know they go into ... or something like that right [noise] um someone from from outside of the ... community perhaps um you know we also saw um them having to make very hard choices about how\nHow to how to keep themselves safe right they would make decisions about who they were friends with\nWho they spend time with based on the capacity of those people to to help keep them safe rather than the capacity of those people to help them achieve their long term goals they all had\nThe long term goals you'd expect of every American get I Want to go to college I'm going to have a job I'm going to have a family in a house um they subscribe to those\nI'm going to have a family in a house um they subscribed to those things but the pathway to getting there it's just very hard for them or to figure out because of the need to navigate their their basic survival on a daily basis\nIn fact I and I want a touchy about on two things so that drip drip and that's the only way that I can describe it but like that day to day stress of living and that type of stress\nThat recent research that we saw around on mortality rack rate to black Lenin giving childbirth and how the research is finding just\nRace tests on is like that ... that leads to these outcomes of early dad what are some solutions on the ground level we're talking cell high up you know policy changes collectively as a society we can invest more\nThat the real realization is like that it's not going to happen overnight\nSo what are some of the more practical things that we're seeing and that we're doing and that we can do to reverse this thing\nYeah well that's that's one of the most important questions in this work and I you know I'm privileged to be able to work with a group of people who's trying to actually intervene in that in a way that actually enhanced his people's sense of self worth let me just start by saying that you know just to make it very\nClear about the date on racism it's very powerful um when you look at the outcomes of African American women in childbirth or or a infant mortality we have some of the worst outcomes\nWhen you look at the outcomes of African women African immigrant women to this country they have some of the best\nAnd as a culture ate their health gets worse and it's true of Latino immigrants is true of white European immigrants every immigrant group is healthier when they get here than their American born counterpart in as they uh culture and become American their health gets\nWorse America is not good for your health so that's a it's a perfect test of racism as a determinant of health\nIf you've got African immigrant women coming here and having good birth outcomes and then as a culture it getting worse what's happening to them as they Americanized variance ing racism\nSo we've simplified this work into basically three things I Am a simple person I like simple things\nUm in complexity is scary for people so if you can offer them a pathway through it it really helps and an organization spending a billion dollars over ten years to try to change\nThose conditions and leave simplified our strategy to ABC I told you were sick three than ABC so a stance for agency an agency is a sense\nOf control over the things that happen to you many people typically low income people feel that they have very little control over what's happening in their lives things are coming out there right left and center and they're trying to juggle all these balls and they evidently dropping balls because they have to juggle too much\nThe narrative in this in this state is has been building towards we all do better when we all do better in a narrative of inclusion is is one that looks to the future with hope it looks to the past with realism recognizes that you know we we grew up in an apartheid country\nThat you know has and it's very DNA racism it's it's built into our institutions and those institutions\nOperate according to that software and we can only do that in California has recognize\nThat the results of that had been profound\nFour and a half million people got health insurance under the Affordable CARE Act mostly through Medicare out um that's more than any other state it's more than most states combined\nWe have a million people who can re classify they're low level felonies as misdemeanors under prop forty seven in fifty seven we have two hundred and eighty thousand undocumented Californians who get full scope health insurance\nThrough mad cow that and we're now pushing to get that up to age twenty six\nYou know we have cut the rate of high school suspensions and expulsions in half\nIncluding for African American Latino Native American kids who have this proportionality and in some of our major school districts Fresno Los Angeles that is heading toward zero\nThat is unprecedented during a time where other big states are going up and this is a product of a narrative of inclusion and California which says we all have to invest in each other this can't just be you know every man for himself\nSo I think the story in California is a good story now the media\nTends to like conflict\nAnd I think that one of the frustrations that many of us have is that the stories are always told about who's fighting with each other as opposed to sort of talking about sort of what's changed what's improved California\nActually there's a recent journal the American Medical Association report that came out just last week that shows California in terms of its overall health status when for number twenty two in the country to number three between Nineteen Ninety six and two thousand and six zero media\nIn the world like nobody's nobody's talking about it so I I think that the the difficulty with the media is that you're often\nForced to tell this portrait story tell a story about a person and this person's sort of interaction with all of these things and you often have a difficult time telling the landscape story yeah you know about what are those policies of sort of institutional\nInteraction so that people are contending with that are making their lives less healthy and I think that you know NPR kick you need is a beautiful job of telling a landscape story with a portrait embedded in it and then if more people told the story you told I think we would be better educated\nThan I Do have a question about education but I Want to honor\nPerson here who is the first to come up to\nThe question I think I Am actually a great segue because my question is related to education and I don't know the details about this I I my understanding a surface I don't have\nKids but I have heard about in San Francisco I'm a lottery system for where the schools that kids can go to you and then they're they're by two different location and my understanding is intention was to\nHave had kids had different opportunities in different locations which then they would benefit from these other schools and\nYou want to hear your thoughts on that and do you feel that it's been effective I had to have that and she outcome that wasn't that\nI can offer I mean I used to live in San Francisco I have kids in San Francisco\nI'm you know the fundamental problem is housing segregation I mean that's the that's the underlying problem\nAnd what the school system is trying to do is is it simply retrofit a some sort of inclusion every policy or you know integration policy on top of this rigid policy of housing segregation by race by class\nAnd so it's an awkward retrofit but it's a necessary retrofit because as much data his suggested I'm Ross charity who stood on a at UC Berkeley in ... prior at UC Berkeley than Harvard now Stanford or did this wonderful studies showing that young people in um low income higher versus the communities\nIf they move at a relatively young age they essentially a crew the benefits of the better community if they move at a young age but for each year that they stay in that\nLow income community um they lose that benefit if they move and by the age of about Thirteen or fourteen there's no benefit to moving from on high adversity community to uh you know a wealthy community so fundamentally what the schools are trying to do is is trying to pull kids out of an environment that is\nSchools are trying to do is is trying to pull kids out of an environment that is you know adverse and and mix them with other kids that aren't experiencing so much at first but they're trying to retrofit a fundamentally racist pattern that it's been laid down across the United states\nReceive that research shows that integration works when it comes to education and the outcomes um even by saying as painful as it as it was in the late seventies all the way through to the nineties we actually see great outcomes from those students who are busting those areas you went into what I wanted\nTo say as a as you call it a retrofit I Would call it a band aid I think that the true um I\nThe truth solution to think about how to invest in those schools that are in the communities where people are\nTo for example schools are not just the place or they don't have to be just a place where children go to you know go to class and then they leave the we invest in schools do our taxes so there is that you know the playground or the gyms or you know all of these different resources that are within schools\nUm that can be used more by communities if they're better invested in\nAnd so if we have mixed income communities and then we have schools that are invested in instead of having to have this band date of busing students to different schools then we have our places right there in the communities where we live in order to be connected to opportunity to answer that drive\nAnd so I think while it might have some good outcomes to start the real question is how do we really get back to those neighborhoods that need investment most and again start to invest right there in those communities\nIn discussion in the discussion on the notion that mix communities economically mix communities which I guess are are sort of cipher for racially ethnically mixed communities\nThe resources floated those communities and the outcomes are positive for for all I think that's that's very true but I think the point you just made\nThat there were lots of reasons that communities may not be economically mixed\nAnd yet the outcome should there should be that opportunity to have that positive outcome anyway because the other implication is that I think we're the ... the the reverse implies that it's\nInstitutional racism in this country that means when communities are mixed there's a healthy a percentage of white people to which the resources flow\nAnd that that to me is one of the a\nSerious endemic problems it shouldn't be that way it should be every community regardless of what it looks like\nHuman down to the the voting precinct level that there should be an equal outcome and I think the the ABC approach says a lot about that but but the uh belonging\nChanging the odds and I guess the first one was agency agency should exist in every single community it shouldn't just we can't wait for the biggest social engineering changed to result in\nSuddenly we now have a housing integration throughout this country because I think that's that's gonna take a long time if I ever thank you\nI'm a huge fan of both and this idea of you know thinking about ways to P. H. communities that are mixed income communities and also thinking about how to invest deeply and communities of color and low income eat it low income communities until we get to that place\nBut you know people get scared like what he's talking about that this is somehow like socially anyway\nSo I actually I think that you have to believe in democracy to do this work you have to believe in the power of optimized democracy to actually use these kinds of outcomes and so\nIn communities where there are ... and it's not just the schools I mean these are communities where there's lacking per lacking healthy food in some cases you're lacking potable water um you know virtually every institution is on life support in many of these communities that's no accident\nThat's because those communities are perceived as essentially being politically weak and not having the agency to change the political dynamics\nAnd so building power at the end of the day to allow communities to hold those institutions accountable it's not a panacea but it's a it's a critical element of repairing not just\nYou know the school but repairing the democracy because we we literally don't facilitate the voice of people in Bay view hunters point who have to deal with you know the shipyards and toxins and you know adverse land uses day in day out why\nI mean they're in the same city is knob hill and and what not there in the same policy regime there just perceived as less valuable and we have to change that perception\nAre there areas that you will see you've talked about these great programs that are happening the fresh food programs on", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11"}
