Want you to gas which is which [noise]\nThe schools with stress [noise] patriotism and respect and it would be a very rural face a educational system\nHow is this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully green and mode or the town of the class with lots of churches that's down one [noise] here's town to the schools would be based more on stereotypes all kinds of things rather than than rote memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theater to foreign films a more of those in churches\nThat was easy right conservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to that so how did these two towns which I guess today refer to as liberal and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward\nExplanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national\nSecurity but what if I told you there is something deep budget those attitudes drives that

on Twitter let's say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\nThese claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts John hippie\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super like grow at Silicon

... but this idea that you know the way that we see here's something must be the way everyone else sees that and there's just this feeling of other disbelief that other people might not see and hear the well the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I Do think that's something we need to continue the pound away on that that we really are wired up quite differently\nLet's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here is Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nWe are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream that you do that here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate here John that it's entirely possible these our politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nI really think you know immigration defense a police law and order I think that's what's really at the core of of who we are and at the core of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us than it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president's wants that\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense is that they can't really understand why anybody would be\nThey reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by a hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe have people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a lot from journal activity or skin conduct tents which is a common way of saying if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative\nThat is true I never been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different and the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different\nKinds of pictures actually we have the most luck with a pictures of mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people you know without knowing anything about them all we would look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about\nLiberal sprained when they looked at a mutilation image is much more active in a part of the brain called the ...\nTo ... century to part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I kick you in the ... century would be active but it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody's stepping on a rocky now goes right through their foot you're somehow to censor it would be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals are more likely to have activation matter of sensory too\nConservative doesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents like my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics does she have to kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins have similar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins\nEach twin Paris raised in the same household each ... each the same food listening to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as a group\nAnd fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology non environment is the driver I asked John what studies revealed by political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data that are the very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda need\nNot long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we object to these data to the standard twin design approach we did indeed uh find that their\nPolitical views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes misread this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but you know that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science that many people didn't like that at all uh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but\nYou know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is [noise] you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component\nIs not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer laying in the political orientation of identical twins then into political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see the you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have which fresh inside\nA ... and you've made the case that in many ways the more we were able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talk to me about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handedness you know we used to think that [noise]\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years

inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talk to me about that idea John [noise]\nYes when other traits have been\nUnderstood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handedness you know we used to think that uh if you're a left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this was long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to interact with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left hand it is very biological this was something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that\nSo we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather what oriented to the world and a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have to deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when\nWe had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was off into the leftist a more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a shortage of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand\nAnd that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so\nAlthough he was elected and I think they recognize he was elected in science fair and square they just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that\nOf the democracy so now the conflict just a sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength but they can also be a credible source of weakness\nAnd the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers but yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right but I Want to have to you can see the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of that the only if maybe that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future\nI think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're willing to go\nAnd so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family writes a family we you know ... every family be moved by the world they disagree about all sorts of things but if there is love and the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down and actually the conflict convince the family apart\n[noise]\nAnd the twentieth century the bonds that

pretty brutal of a police and sheriff's on the other side who are going to take that opportunity to beat up the protesters used dogs water cannons so so what he realized is\nThat if if you could make

there is no fixing it we actually have to break it down and I think the point that you're making is truly when me which is that king wrapped himself into flak you wrap themselves in this ideal of the American democracy and that potentially is what made the conflict productive\nRight so look you know there were a lot of things he was concerned about but he said let's take these principles and actually try to see if we can all live by them mhm mhm I think we need to remember\nAmerican democracy is far from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and it is generated tremendous progress
