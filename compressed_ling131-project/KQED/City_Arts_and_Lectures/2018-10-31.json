yard sign more with my neighbors as we head into the midterm election [noise]\nWhen I was house hunting in the fall of twenty sixteen there weren't any signs in any yards to indicate the political leanings of my potential neighbors\nI didn't know what this men and so I asked my realtor a lifelong nebraskan who told me it wasn't Nebraska nice meaning it was considered sort of rude to have a political sign out in your yard\nI grew up in Florida in Miami a in a neighborhood where the bar for were counted as rude was quite a bit higher [noise]\nIn my family help nudge that far higher when they moved in they were the first Cubans to buy into a predominantly white neighborhood prompting the white flight that's made our neighborhood overwhelmingly Latino today\nWhen my dad paid it off he celebrated by burning various house related documents over a charcoal grill in the backyard it's kind of rude actually um he made it all come outside to watch and within a year\nOver a charcoal grill in the back yard a kind of rude actually um he made it all come outside to watch and within a year he would decide to borrow against the house to help me pay for college they claim they were happy to help me and I believe them\nThey threw me a surprise party when I graduated from college I was the first in my family to do so and it was in many ways a party for all of us\nThey rented a banquet hall invited everyone they felt had played a key part in my arriving at that moment and told me we were going to a cousin's baby shower shortly after everyone yelled surprise my dad took the microphone and started the festivities by introducing one of the few white American families there he pointed to them and said do you\nRecognize these people I did not [noise]\nShe said those are the people who sold us our house\nBecause we lived in that house you went to the schools you went to had the teachers you add everything we would not be standing here today had they never told us that house my the family waves from their table [noise]\nI don't think they knew why they were there on this I think I was a baby shower to um [noise]\nSentiment that house is so much more than a house that house means destiny opportunity has played out in various ways throughout my life\nWhile married I saved for a house house becoming synonymous with future and with family\nThe first time I've ever owned in Tallahassee, Florida came with a cautionary tale I bought it from a lawyer\nWho had been given the how does a wedding present from his parents who just happens to live in the house next door for reasons that were never made clear but about which the town's real estate agents loved to speculate\nThat house had been on the market for more than a year the rumor being at the sellers father had put out a warning that no one should buy it\nEither moved there from Los Angeles and his warning had it made it that far\nEveryone who came to work on the house had a story one contractor told me that when the previous owners had put up the for sale signs the sellers mother came over with a marker and defaced it scrolling at the cost of our love\nThe sellers father would often knock on my door and ask after the baby for getting over and over again that I did not have children he would glance passed me into the living room with the look on his face and said why do you need all this space\nWhen the marriage ended and the house was sold with it when everything the house was supposed to become I moved to Nebraska\nSingle singing the praises of renting forever\nThat is until ... intervened a financial planner she'd been recommended to me by an accountant who sense from my shoe box full of receipts and my habit of bringing every officials looking paper mailed to me to our meetings that I needed some financial guidance\nLondon was in her mid fifties and about a foot taller than me she had a wide smile and personalize coasters on her desk\nShe was originally from Mitchell South Dakota and I'd been to mental famed corn palace once so we hit it off instantly [noise]\nFirst things first one to set after reviewing the financials of my life you need to buy some property in Lincoln that probably means a house\nI did want anyone under forty does in a moment like that I tweeted someone tell me if I should buy a house question mark [noise]\nAmong the response was a direct message from my former husband who hadn't been in contact in months\nNo you should not buy a house condo though\nMaybe just my two year old not two cents he wrote euro [noise]\n\nFor the first time in my life I had a stable income no debt and no financial dependence and I just sold a house I knew I was very lucky and I was supposed to do something responsible with this privilege I asked ... if I could\nBuy a condo or a loft or maybe a warehouse I joked I wanted to be able to roller skate inside of whatever property I own\nRun a real all of this down [noise]\nShe looks up from her no pat and said I Would say Lincoln's got another Fifteen Twenty years before I was lucky enough city to support warehouse living [noise]\nI showed her the message from my ex husband and told her that I'd crowd source of the question she said everything I'm putting together about you it sounds like your number one priority with a property is what I'd call ease of eggs and its meaning getting out of something quickly if I needed to\nIn Lincoln she said that's a single family home but that's not for me I argued homes or for families homes determine everything from where your kid might go to college to how long your marriage will last\nI was sitting at her office in pajama pants and in a shirt that said team Gigi and had all sketch it catches them off or Golden Girls process is [noise]\nIt took almost a year for lunch to help me rewrite the narrative that had been keeping me from buying a home\nIn the one I Would eventually by I stood next to my realtor and its bathroom and freaked out about the size of an at the site of an oversized customs help from Nineteen thirty nine which was built in seats look perfect for bathing a couple of toddlers I shook my head and said I Can't buy the house is his first family I see kids in the tub\nMy realtor shrugs that's weird I see a tub [noise]\nMet with a lot of again after closing on the house I brought many official looking paper she did not need she said the next thing I Need to do was drop a well I said no thanks [noise]\nIt was really painful moment that\nSeemed to accomplish nothing um her colleagues still voted for the bill and then she pre figured Christine Blasey Ford who blew up her life to testify that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school\nOnly to see him confirmed anyway and she um graduating or described to me how depressing and demoralizing it was to watch ... go through this come forward subject yourself to the world's hospitals scrutiny and then habits seem to make no difference\nBut it did make a difference um the demoralization didn't last and on the Sunday after Kavanaugh is confirmed Widmer held a packed rally with New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's\nIt's still just like I was back at the women's march she said the previous day had been really really terrible for a lot of women but they were showing up and seeing one on one another and saying we've got work to do\nA show with my for my friend's taxed and asked her if we're going to be OK if she was really sure that Democrats were going to to win this time I Am she said I see it every day I talked to people every day\nAnd so we talked a lot of politicians and part of their job is to project optimism\nNevertheless if you kind of are in a dark place\nLike I Am often in a dark place um all the way to find some of that optimism is to talk to the women who are out there working their hearts out to stop him you know if you're scared if you were furious if you're a despondent find a Democrat\nAnd go canvas go knock on doors I mean canvas thing is is volume um it's the best way to feel good about the world and connect with people as she as we were told me\nSo I read all the books about fascism I'm like [laughter]\nSo I read all the books about fascism I'm like [laughter] if you look at my table you can see why I said no fun at parties but [noise]\nOne of the recent ones how fascism works\nBy the professor Jason Stanley was I think particularly important because it's one of the few that focused on the role of um gender and patriarchy in in in the fascist resurgence and he talked about patriarchy is quote strategically central to fascist politics\n... because they always seek to cement racial and gender hierarchies um and if he put it when a winning team physicians of political power usually reserved for men or when Muslims blacks Jews homosexuals are cosmopolitan profit or even share the public good to have a democracy such as health\nCare that is perceived as corruption he wrote\nSo that sentence encapsulates how Trump is the most corrupt president in American history can sell themselves just corruption opponent but it also shows why so many women sense an existential threat from Trump that goes beyond his personal Boris ...\nI think women all over the country understand intuitively that his threat to liberal democracy in his threat to gender equality are intertwined\nSoon really soon a majority of women could rise up repudiate repudiate him and at long last create a check on his power women do of course not only women could save this country and themselves\nLonging for this to happen and not being a short it will is almost physically painful the only way to feel better to do something to help you [noise]\n\n\n\n\nI\nAnd you're just an amazing crowd\nAnd she's like yeah [noise]\nSo it's our great pleasure to 'em and privilege to Iraq to engage and nice [noise]\nIt's been a contributing\nOpinion writer for a number of years so I'm pretty recently we decided the world could use trend vice so we've launched the abstract fan and vice calm and she is going to do a little bit of it live for you it's nice [noise]\nI Love San Francisco it's a pleasure to be here tonight and this

in awhile listen to Dr Laura who is the whole [noise]\nThere's a reason why I moved from the Dr Laura and it has to do with love\n'cause I don't care about Dr Laura I think she's the one part of it\nBut I actually got a question that I answered in this week's column and it's about love\nAnd so I thought I Would read my answer well I'm also going to read the questions that you know what why as to who was [noise]\nIt goes well\nDirects than I Am a forty three year old single never been married educated mother of one and would like advice on love\nI'm navigating dating life need to fully understand the difference between loving someone being in love and having a soul mate I Love the idea of love and would very much like to spend the rest of my life with a man but I find myself having commitment issues because I'm afraid of choosing wrong\nI see couples that have been married ten Fifteen Twenty years who get divorced and seemed to be completely fine with it it's scary to me because I Would like my marriage to last a lifetime and my over thinking this totally or being too paranoid or do you really never know because only time will tell\nSincerely where the hell is the love of my life [noise]\nDeer searching for the love of her life\nWe live in a culture that idealize as the idea of love and the idea that there is one true person who completes you fulfill all your dreams and love you forever\nWe're told from an early age that are true love is out there waiting for us and so we urine to find them to know what it feels like to experience true love to know you have made the right choice\nThe truth about love is that it is often but we'll during a knowable you may never know if you have made the right choice but when love is true you embrace all of the unknowns regardless\nI Am forty four and a complicated romantic situation never been married I'm no expert on love I Love the idea of love but I have lived in love long enough to recognize\nThat there is a difference between the idea of\nAnd the reality is love you never really know if we're marriage relationship will last a lifetime you can want that you can work hard to make a relationship work and have the best of intentions instill things might not work out but that doesn't mean you of wasted your time or failed\nMany people who choose divorce are completely fine with it because they know the difference between the idea and reality of love they know there was nothing to be gained from staying in a marriage simply because the idea of love demands pretending everything is fine\nSponsorship

motion transfer and responding to users unique shape weight and temperature learn more leap world dot com\nAnd your letter you are very much focused on what could be rather than what is you worry about choosing wrong but are not considering that you might choose right for a lifetime or write for a moment\nWhen you meet someone and start dating you have no idea where things will lead us hopes yes and dreams but you also have to get from one day to the next getting to know a person deciding to deepen the relationship and sometimes choosing the formula is a commitment\nAnd it's still very important to know what you want from a relationship but you also have to create space for a relationship to develop without worrying about what that relationship will or will not become\nIf you ask thirty three people about the difference between loving someone being in love and soul mates you will get thirty three different answers so I Will simply tell you what these things are to me\nI Am all about the chase seduction and will not just during the shimmering early days of a relationship but also years and when you're thinking about the maddening ways your person behaves but still is this a day a good day to send them some for some flowers or bring them their favorite coffee\nWhen you find the one you just know but that isn't guaranteed some people never find the one or there are several people for whom you have such feelings or you think you have found the one and they change or you change in ways you can no longer tolerate\nLovers so God damn messy there are days when I hate mother as much as I Love it when I just want to walk away and give up but still\nMe but you have to find some kind of outlet for the paying for the grief for the rage otherwise it will consume you I also think it's important to find a community that you feel comfortable in in San Francisco is an odd city I always think of it as a diversity because I'm from Omaha Nebraska\n[laughter] and so really anything as diverse compared to [laughter] um but there\nAren't a lot of black people here and so you might want to go toward Oakland where there is a firebrand\nFlash [noise] um\nAt least for socializing and when you find community you will be able to share your grief with other people who are going to understand exactly what you mean and that can be really really useful and then also the Internet I find a lot of community online\nBecause for until recently I've lived in the middle of nowhere and so when I wanted to talk about these kinds of things I found black friends on the Internet and it sounds a little silly but it's been invaluable to me to be able to talk about that when you I live in a well not anymore but until the first I Lived in um Lafayette, Indiana\nWhich there are not a lot of black people they're either and it's so it was really useful to develop a community on line of black people so that when these things happen and I think oh my God my I'm going to murder my neighbor um I Know that people can talk me off the ledge and say no don't go to jail for them\n[laughter] friends are very good enough friend\nUm thank you I we have one last question here for Oxfam hello Roxanne [noise] what is your best loved comfort food that you would share it with a dear friend and tough times\nI Know emotional eating can make us crazier than we might already be personally speaking but perhaps speaking for more than just yourself but also as soon as love ensued as medicine for me and many other how do we reconcile or many hunger is how do you do that [noise]\nThat's a great question I don't the older I get the more I recognize that I'm allowed to have hunger and that it's okay to satisfy those hunger is within moderation my dad loves to talk about moderation walks on everything in moderation okay and I'm always like [noise]\nYeah I got it [noise] um [noise]\nBut it's true I think that a lot of the reason that we see so many people having such unhealthy relationships to joy to food to sex\nTo to to vice\nIs because we're told not to have any we deprive ourselves of so much that could make life a little easier and and so I'm working on just indulging when I Want and um my nutritionist has been really into this thing called intuitive eating which is exactly what it sounds like\nAnd it should be that complicated\nBut it's been really useful like when you are craving something allow yourself to have it deprivation never works out and so that's how I'm working on reconciling my hunger and in terms of comfort\nFood I really love Italian food and I would love to share a good um set of ravioli with a friend or lasagna anything with carbohydrate\nCheese tomatoes and more cheese [noise]\nFrom where she is yes especially when it's\nMelt the and it starts pulling and that's just like oh this is sex right now [noise]\nThank you for that if a welcome um we have a herd of advice from my stand now are going to end the evening with that conversation with everyone um so I Want to invite Janine and Michelle to come back on\nStage at all [noise] [noise]\nI think for having back out and I wanted to start\nA talking a little bit of women in politics were in a city that knows how to elect women um so I thought it seems like\nA good moment to do it um ... we talked about them in terms of a lot and um people are talking about the idea of a pink wave or the a lot of women running and it echoes nation any too which is also called the air and the woman so we're going to do a very quick games\nWhich is ... to ... and you're going to tell me if it's from Nineteen Ninety two year old woman [laughter] for twenty eight candy whatever the Soviet called sleep we are either you you are yes\nUm I mean if you could get help from

never really thought that their reproductive rights are at risk and all of a sudden there is that risk and Israel is that from Nineteen Ninety two or twenty Eighteen [noise]\nBut how the so no I'm going to guess Nineteen eighty two um that's like more optimistic than the world but I don't think they know is worried by literature and meet the press in July wow God help those old man I'm\nOkay this is describing\nA campaign out of the campaign ad opens with the hands of the pin striped suited man walking up Barbie doll across the TV screen some politicians treat women like they're not quite
