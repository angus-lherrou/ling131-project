[noise]\n\nYou know Kevin voice or as a regular guest on the daily and when he's not against somebody which feels like a lot\nAre a ... of the times you were a writer at large of the New York times\nUm you are a columnist at the time as you were a writer at large at the New York times magazine and how do you describe your ...\nAh I cover like the worst people on the Internet\nLike\nI don't know I I feel like I'm you know unlike dirty jobs when they have those guys who like put on wet suits and dive down into the tanks of sewage unplug the sewers like me but like on a computer [laughter]\nUm [laughter] but on the computer um and\nThe funny thing about you people don't know is it before you were even a columnist before even gotten the times you wrote two books and the first of those books have like a pretty wild premise and I want to remind people about what that was\nYeah so when I was in college I uh didn't sign up for a study abroad program instead I went um undercover at Jerry Falwell Liberty University\nAny uh and the other one does any liberty alumni out there\nThat I didn't I didn't think so um [noise]\nAh anyway so I Know you're not even jealous no no no no I I grew\nUp in a sort of very liberal Quaker House\nAnd I'm not the oatmeal not the oatmeal we get a lot of that you're you're uh you're on to say they're cute or not\nBut I I Wonder experience life on the other side and see this was during the tail end of of the Bush years\nUm the George W. Bush and I wanted to kind of see what the religious right we're doing now obviously liberty is like\nYou know Trump gave the commencement address there last year it's become sort of a big um Republican uh operative machine um\nBut back then it was still run by the senior Jerry Falwell um who's since died and it was it was a bizarre and and sort of wild experience of being not only like going to classes there but living in the dorms and singing and the church choir and\nThings like that and how undercover worry people now that you were writing a book\nNo no I I transferred there as if I was like you know just a student and I I I went to to brown which is sort of like the opposite of\nIf you focus on like from from from brown to liberty yeah it ... it was like I'm actually they had a very funny reaction to the liberty 'cause like I was sitting there say where'd you come\nFrom and I would say I would say you know I went to brown and the and they said my God I'm so sorry\n[laughter] it must be awful there how do you how did you do that they assumed I was like an evangelical\nTrapped um [laughter] so we had fun in a liberal you want you to college with past celebrates yeah um do you go to ground you did whoa [noise]\nUm I'm In San Francisco to Ivy League schools are listed applause [laughter]\nYes yes [laughter] um [laughter]\nI don't feel it starts it starts to feel the me going back and looking at your resume that at the idea of ... of of putting yourself in a sort of ... to you at least an exotic\nWorld and just kind of bearing herself into is you're calling card and the most recent version of that as as listeners nearly no has been immersing yourself profoundly in meeting the darkest corners of the weather I mean as you said you're a beat is kind of prefer perversion of of the Internet\nYou know I'm I'm interested in extremes I'm interested in people who choose to live very differently than I Do and um and part of what we've seen happen over the past several years is that the Internet and social media has has really giving voice to extremist and I'm I'm very interested in how that happens\nAnd what kinds of things that used to do and where they congregate so I'm I have you know every day I wake up and I turned on my computer and I I have like a whole running list of like awful for Ken a sub boards and read it threads that I check and then I you know to check my email [laughter]\nAfter you take a shot back exactly I mean\nI Wish people why we put together this particular cast of characters on stage and it's because we're very much wanted to explain the essential elements of what it is to make a daily and so here on stage tonight you have the three ... atomic elements of the show you have your dashing host me [noise]\nUm you have [noise]\nYou have your your your intrepid undercover reporter and you have your brilliance behind the scenes producer any brown [noise]\n\nAnd and and together we're going to come to our back the curtain on on of course the tech industry but also how ... how we make the daily and the reality is that when you drop back the curtain on a daily it's not always so perfect and highly produced or even pretty and I say that because you may remember that if you listen to\nThe first couple of weeks in the show I don't come from the world of audio I don't I have no experience in the world of audio\nI mean in reality I Do not deserve to be an audio host I did not come from this world I Am not want to do and um and when the show started I encountered a tremendous my difficulty actually just doing the work of of being an audio host my voice was much higher than it is now we can talk about how that changed um\nAnd I do read audio ... yeah that's what I call it um and and I\nGenuinely struggle with just the basics of like saying we'll be called a billboard of the top of the show from the New York times and today and the and all that stuff and and I could not do it and we will be in the studio for hours yeah trying to make it work [noise]\nIt's yeah it's just so normally I didn't think that would be a joke that [laughter] that's a that's kind of a story that became kind of like took on mythic quality is on the team whenever someone would joined the team with the Taliban out of the night before the daily\nThe team we would tell them of the night before the daily launched and all the producers were packed in the studio with Michael and we spent an hour trying to get him to say the date with enough ... that it could\nCould you could launch the daily and it would feel like we were taking on this moment with enough ...\nAnd we and we spend an hour just each producer trying their hand at ... at coaching him like oh it's all just below words slower land this way and we we actually have the last Fifteen seconds of this of this hour for you thank you Wednesday\nSo they were sort of advocating\nFor just a more so I I'm trying to figure out what role does does this accord play in the actual unite the Right rally and ultimately I guess the violence for it I mean how\nDirectly do you feel like a site like this conversation is like those that you're listening to and we just heard and a contributing to what happens there wasn't\nAny space where people are able to gather in sort of semi private or private areas is is going to be prone to this I mean there's not I don't think this is this court's fault\n'em but I think after that after our story ran after the the podcast came out they did to crack down on these guys and and ban a lot of the biggest for clusters of extremists from their server since then you know it's more it popped up but they're keeping a closer eye on it now and you ended up interviewing\nPeople in this group in this disorder but\nYeah I I called up a couple of the members and and one in particular was sort of one of the leaders of this group is one of the organizers of the rally and he's a big some Internet I'm All right presence and um yeah we had a very interesting conversation\nI Want to play this clip of you're talking to the white nationalist because I think it does something really important and explaining why we\nI think it does something really important and explaining why we created the daily and why the show is what it is which is\nIt creates a real transparency around reporting and storytelling and one of the things we don't talk about on the show is kind of how much the show is guided by what happened in the presidential election and the feeling that a lot of the town I don't know if you had I definitely had that\nJournalism and kind of failed us in twenty sixteen and then we had arrived at a point where readers justifiably like didn't understand how we were getting our information and so little misled about the conclusions that that they have drawn because of the recording we did\nAnd and the deal is all about reading listeners really understand how journalism half\nWhat it's like to be on the phone with somebody what it's like when Dianne Feinstein answers the phone or in this case a white nationalist interrogate you and and I want to play that they can they think it helps people understand what journals and actually sounds like\nA joint if I ask you a question you sort of stopped and said well can I ask you a question for the personal\n[noise] what race are you a\n... you've seen my profile if you look Hispanic to me I'm not as a wider is Jewish says the question [noise]\nWell if you're white than a than a few years there'll be part of this group [laughter] [noise] okay All right [laughter] I have a good day\nI mean he's ... he's basically trying to beat you into saying something ... and this is\nLike the kind of story that would never that that would never make it into a print version probably but that we would I Would tell them you know my colleagues at the bar or that would come up in conversation I I Love that about\nIt's sort of what the reporter's notebook element of the day and that's what's so fun as we get to writers for for the paper and then bring all of the kind of extra material in and make it you know come alive in audio\nAnd we only have the Clinton because he was actually recordings you so I think it's important to understand that it wasn't like you were recordings conversations necessarily fear it I think you were doing some kind of fact checking with him in this conversation he records that and then she\nUploads it on to you as a kind of like gotcha moment\nAnd this is sort of crazy to me that like you are in in your regular reporting life\nAre signed yourself in these kinds of there'll be tracks where your sources are trying to catch ill or or like corner you see that you say something that could potentially be damning for your career\nYeah and I always have to be on the lookout for that I mean are there are a lot of people with strong feelings about the New York times positively or negatively and we've we've learned that you know there are people who will try to plant false stories will try to trick us we'll try to catch us\nDoing something um so it's just it just makes you more cautious as a reporter I think\nI Wonder how much time you spend thinking about the dangers of amplifying this kind of journalism I mean you send your day in this world\nAnd then you write about it and then you come on a daily and we're all collectively putting a lot of energy and time and friend in audio into essentially giving these people may be a bigger platform and I wonder how you grapple with that\nYeah it's something that I think about a lot and I obviously you know we don't want to be a megaphone for people with extreme or sort of dangerous views on the other hand I'm\nAs with this court like a lot of times are reporting on this is the thing that brings the existence of these communities into people's awareness\nAnd in some cases actually leave the platforms themselves to kind of crack down on them so even though we may be amplifying like one specific set of people\nIt can lead to a major overhaul and changes at these platforms which can them sort of like it'd be a net good more the quality of the conversation but I also think like that's kind of I when I get to watch a lot like how can you amplify things like Q A non or um things in my room mate on the fringes\nAnd I guess my answer is that these people have platforms I mean there there are people like Alex Jones and others\nHave enormous Internet platforms they they sort of um you know sometimes they're bigger than ours and so I think in that case we can sort of service like a translator or a corrective interest explaining to people sort of what's happening who's involved and what um what's the nature of the conversation\nIf that's how ... how much did a sites like Facebook Twitter you to how much of a rule that they play in taking what you are experiencing underscored and letting it run at all free on their websites\nWell this is sort of like how\nAnd and hate speech and sort of extremist content moves through the Internet there's like sort of a well established\nPath for it goes from like you know this corridor for Ken goes to read it and that goes to Twitter and then it goes to Facebook and you too\nUm so that's pretty familiar I think that ... ... ... right now what some of these companies are grappling with this kind of like how do we interrupt that chain or like how do we make it so that the stuff doesn't I'm getting millions of eyeballs on it but it's hard right like these people are crafting if you shut them down one place they move to another place\nI'm with a different name so a lot of the servers that that got deleted from discord after Charlottesville are now back up with with other names um and if your platform is kind of like a whack a mole game it's it's pretty much sort of it's hard to win where are these guys now\nUm they some of them are are still on discord they've also moved into um groups on what's after they've moved into\nMoved into um groups on what's that they've moved into um they moved down to read it they're they're sort of spread out a little more than they used to be outside of centralized where you have five thousand people in one group but they have sort of smaller\nPockets of that and one of the things you've done so well on a daily is\nExplain how much accountability or non accountability has occurred when it comes to the big social media companies that have been number comes from both burden by this and in some people's minds complicit in its applications so\nYou have kind of made a sub beat it and your job of explaining to the world what Facebook\nEspecially has been doing when it comes to this and\nMy favorite episodes of the daily and I never expected them to be even listen I'm all\nFor the congressional hearings evolving or summer\nYeah those are fun to watch that I don't even watch all five hours of it\nBut you know people don't watch congressional hearing like I was like I I'm not a I was not a news for the daily and you I wouldn't have dreamed of wanting to watch a congressional hearing and I think one of the things that is so powerful that that you as a as a narrator on the daily is that\nYou can make it fun in a way that like I'm sort of I I can be can be tricked into watch into watching a congressional hearings and and and and this hearing to see how the context as you can remember what happened with basically what's going to be this\nThis moment where we were going to have\nA we were going to have Congress really holding Facebook accountable for what happened\nWell it's sort of what happened in the election and in Cambridge Analytica but the but this moment where they they could really they could ask Mark Zuckerberg anything and it was going to like we're all sort of waiting to see what it would be and you as a narrator it was so fun 'cause we saw\nIt I'll just let you hear it and therefore you consider my personal use ... dead on the companies do not mind is that is [noise]\nNo senator actually that's the first line of our terms of service say that you control and own the information and content that you put on Facebook\nAnd so he felt a little like a five hour tech support call [laughter]\nLife trying to explain to someone very patiently how their iPhone weren't [laughter]\nTo turn the dial on on that kind of viral concept actually having a little bit harder time these days getting the kind of audience that they once had and they're starting to experiment with other types of stories\nUm because of the outrage machine doesn't work as quite as well as it used to\nAnd I'm Kevin this has been a very serious discussion it's been kind of heavy most daily discussions are kind of reality and I think before we even think about\nTurning to our saviors in the audience for today we want to have lightened things up just a touch that\nOne of the things about making a new show with a new house to hasn't been an audio is that you learn their verbal tank and as I'm sure you all know Michael Barbara has a pretty recognizable verbal attack\n... [noise]\nIt comes in many forms it's a it's quite polarizing people feel many different ways about it\nYou guys get like a lot of emails about the ... yeah [noise]\nWe do we get at least one or two a week yeah about the ... I have a pretty\nI have a somewhat of noxious reply to the people who don't like it would you like type ... H M\nM M M M M [noise]\nIt's not just as a\nProducer that you've done that email every time the feels like you're saying the same joke over and over again\nSo we're I suppose you could sell as a ring tone though like you know [laughter]\nSo what's interesting about it and it's like oh you are to deal with and why this weird take I have well let's talk about why I actually do the right which is um when you're a journalist and you're on the phone with somebody and they're they're just sort of drawing on and on or saying wonderful thing there aren't that many ways of affirming\nThem or making them think you're still listening\nYou could do a lot of things without agreeing with thing you could you do the dishes you can do I mean you can go off and do a lot of things it's it's really more about ... ... you can get on with your mother ... [laughter]\nReally more about the fact that it's about it's about the fact that\nYou could be talking to someone that you don't agree with you and they can be saying something that you don't want to affirm\nBut you want to say I hear you and you want the audience you know they are still there and that and I think a lot of say right yeah yeah when we talk to people but saying that sounds like you're actually two white nationalist do I sound like you're affirming them I I feel\nVery firm personally when I go on that when I go to the daily I mean it's like I spend an hour the guys\nYou make me sound very large just an hour yeah and and and I get a lot of affirming ... and I feel like I honestly I should be like paying your co pay for this [laughter] it's a good experience I Hope everyone in this room someday has a chance to be affirmed by these guys [noise]\nOh that's in the ... there was something that any brand new Mays yet waiting to them yes and we're wondering if it's anyone's birthday tonight they reduce\nYesterday that's pretty good okay this one for you we have a brand name [noise]\n\n\n\nIf if there is an explanation [noise] it was my birthday it was everything and anti brown made\nWell I also didn't have to change any of the pages of the [noise] you just in the right pitches it's I just took one interview and took all the ... uh give\nThat went on during\nThe ...\nYou know [laughter]\nIn the in the Dropbox there's just like a folder of ... so there is now there is but I I loved ones are like ... [noise]\nAnd I had no way we're going to turn to pick you in a we are\nAnd before we do that I Want to thank you both coming all the way out here to be truly thank\nYou [noise] sort\nOf come to life and the questions Hi I'm just kind of works well with the last question\nAnd the question Hi I'm just kind of\nWorks well with the last question I was wondering when you described a slow news day what if a lot is happening in the world and I love how you do the ending where you're like here's where else what else happens today how do you prioritize what story you tell on any given day so\nIn the morning so a number of the team goes to the nine thirty which is also called the front page meeting where they discuss what is coming that day on what you expect maybe we're expecting someone to resign are expecting this hearing to happen\nIs going to do an announcement owned by the way the science desk has it's interesting feature that's coming out\nAnd like the night and the magazine is going to release this profile\nUm and and we we leave there with like a ... with a rough outline of of of what what we want to cover\nAnd I think when we think about a story that is a daily story um as as a as a story for the daily it has to be a news event that you either\nMust on you have to understand something complicated in order to understand what's happening in this moment it's such a development in the mail or investigation that we've\nYou know we're adding a detail to a store we've told a bunch of times we put that in the what we call the headlines at the end of the shell but if it's something where you're like oh man this is complicated this changes the way that I understand something\nOr we need to tell the story of this person before we like it so that you can understand the department of education and this new development we will we will devoted show to that\nAnd there are times where we don't want to do it but we have to blow up the show because because I thought it was our president because news happens\nAnd and we resist for hours where we're kind of like\nYou know no no no nothing I mean how does that mean you can make a headline and this happened just having a few weeks\nAgo where we were making the series on family separations divided with Caitlin Dickerson and any corral and we had three days planned and we had the the stories are made by ... by two of my colleagues\nAnd I'm an after the first day there was the the Manafort and Cohen guilty pleas and and and conviction and we didn't want to cover it because we had this thing planned and a member of the mass had who is one of the most senior editors of the whole newspaper came down to\nThe daily and was like regular visits lesson [laughter] can't you can't ignore that and we also for like you\nDon't have [noise]\nI'll tell you were like sometimes we defined a show by what we would never recover yeah and we decided as a rule we would never cover a presidential tweet as an episode because like it was just not enough [noise]\n[noise]\nNo I mean like if you think about doing special like swat characters with them more all the like ... you know\nJust like it's in Congress with who we are\nBut I Will say that there was a there was the day that that um the comment was made we we showed at the same question of like your comment toll comment was made the um we we talk about the idea of like how do we do an episode about a sentence and we all are like I don't know like what are we going to say like it that's rude\nThat like you know it's like it's not that much to say about it and so\nWe until we realized that there is like that there was a story that led up to that moment that like\nThere there had been these these two senators from across the aisle who were coming to Trump's office to present a bipartisan immigration deal and then out of the wings came all of these immigration hawks who are like super conservative and they were literally walking into the oval office yes\nIn a surprise addition to the to the meeting\nAnd and they're whispering in Trump's ear and pulling and in this direction and and these two bipartisan senators are saying no no what about our deal and in this moment he says this comment and it was in and that was the daily story and we were like okay we got to do it without an episode and and I I feel\nLike when when we when we can ... in that way where like this ... matters because\nNo choice [laughter] seven are\nAre in the day all the time I Am in the in the here's where those renewed innocence yeah\nYeah so\nI'm so one of my favorite parts of the daily is I'm kind of humanizing aspect it gives to all these\nReporters that I get to read from it in print but then hearing the voice and things like that it's just a whole different elements I'm my question is how have those reporters who have been featured on the daily um how did they react to that new\nForm or a new kind of medium of journalism and I know like for some of your up here it's created this other level of kind of fame maybe very nice same I'm not sure but\n[laughter] oh you mean like the family [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts
