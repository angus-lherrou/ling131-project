years it's the longest war the U.S has ever fought and there is no end in sight there is however one victory the west can applaud\nThe media environment in Afghanistan is one of the most important games since two thousand one in that country\nOr it's an extremely free and free wheeling media there are numerous satellite channels that are really popular numerous very credible print and other media outlets covering\nDomestic and international politics that's Johnny Walsh I'm a senior expert on Afghanistan and the U.S Institute for peace and a former State Department official\nHe says the free wheeling media kind of happened organically with the advent of social media and the deregulation of TV channels across the Arab world voice of America and other us back media broadcast into Afghanistan but Walsh says it's locally produced programs that people really listen to\nI think messaging is virtually always more effective\nIf locals are sincerely delivering yet and generally speaking the U.S will never be as good at being compelling at that being persuasive in any country outside of town as the locals of that country themselves are\nAnd so oftentimes the best us messaging efforts are less about our delivering a message and more about simply providing a platform for people in that country to provide their own message\n[noise] so I remember the state department helped

new broadcaster as I've gotten too liberal for some rulers you know across\nThe Arab world to some extent in Pakistan and there are numerous examples where governments in Egypt in the U. A. E. you know in in putative us partners have shut down either a messaging or pro democracy programs over the years\nIt's always a delicate balance and at least in normal times those governments understand that part of the deal with having a relationship with the U.S is that they're going to support anti extremist pro democracy programs have different sorts\nYou're right he was he was forced off the air he fled to Egypt for a while he tried to do is show on NBC Saturday on channel with a seemingly liberal bent a and that didn't work out either and now he's here in the U.S on an academic fellowship\nAnd I think what his story shows is when you leave that value proposition of I'm partnering with the authorities to challenge extremism in the society and you start talking about challenging the authorities themselves it's unsustainable within the borders of an autocratic country\nBut I guess how how much um authenticity will you have if you can't criticize the ruling elite with the viewers I mean what they see that you're just basically an arm of the corrupt leadership\nThat is definitely one of the trade offs um and so your popularity is inextricably linked to the popularity of the ruler [noise]\nUh we do have some examples of autocrats who are popular right now with young people\nBut certainly there are those who are extremely unpopular so that that is the essential tradeoff if you want to work within the territory of the autocracy is on the other hand you go the route of Iraqi John Stewart and you start broadcasting from Germany\nYou risk another type of challenge to you or authenticity which has have working for the German government so it's six of one half a dozen of the other and people adjust according to their own comfort levels and preferences\n[noise] so how can you measure whether or not all of this is working to create change positive change [noise]\nDoing so is especially difficult in environments where focus groups and opinion surveys are\nLess effective uh because of concerns about expressing your own opinion you can sometimes gain insight into a programs impact from the backlash it stirs overtime so for example there was a long running comedy in Saudi Arabia called Tosh montage\n\nAt\nThe beginning it was very easy for them\nAnd on the other hand that extremists are getting a culture rated to challenges from liberal [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThat's just a crowd of ...

I became\nInterested in Islamic television preaching\nWhen I saw the growing popularity of very young preachers with a no\nKind of traditional religious education with Muslim viewers in Egypt and when I began to realize was that these creatures were very invested in changing what Islamic media sounds and looks like so they they felt that traditional Islamic media was very boring very conventional\nTo those who was in the ... and the you\nKnow one wanted to listen to men in bushy beards yell about all the different ways they're going to go to hell but those are those reviews they would have refused disobeyed ... that those votes can be justice and they felt\nThat what was needed with a new kind of Islamic media that spoke to youth in in in ways that they were familiar with from watching a reality shows are music videos or Hollywood entertainment\nSo I became interested in how these creatures were trying to re imagined what Islamic media sounds and looks like [noise]\nOne of the first major events where the preachers began to show their influence was during the Egyptian revolution in twenty eleven [noise]\nDuring the actual Eighteen days of the uprising against Mubarak most people were not interested in watching the sonic television preachers there were very interested in watching BBC algae Sierra uh CNN and watching news coverage of the revolution\nBut immediately after Mubarak resigned people began to look to Islamic television preachers to offer them kind of commentary or solutions to the many political problems and economic problems that Egypt was facing\nSo it was interesting to see was how the Islamic television preachers I was working with began to re imagined their role as kind of social critics or as people who would offer various kinds of solutions to the different problems facing\nEgypt in the immediate aftermath of the revolution [noise]\nWell my ... is a very important to make media figure he is a thirty something preacher who is currently pursuing a PHD at Cambridge University in the u._k.\nAn over the past years Masood has really been pushing the boundaries of what Islamic media or Islamic television preaching looks and sounds like [noise]\nUm I was\nRight after the revolution whereas the Masood release and important program called a ... an Arabic or a revolution within a revolution of the south where he called on Egyptians to to become new kinds of people people who were kind of live up to the promise of\nRevolutionary Egypt in terms of democracy and coexistence intolerance and a civil disagreement\nAnd he did that through our religious idiom for most Muslims the solution to political and economic problems lies in a more correct understanding of what the Islamic tradition teaches and upholds\nSo when you tune into his YouTube channel you're going to find him singing with a guitar with one of Egypt or most famous revolutionary artists and he's going to be singing a song against a dogmatic thinking weather from a religious people or a non religious people [noise]\n... and ...\nYou're going to find him starring in a TV drama series that also has a religious message to impart over thirty episode\nThe stricken ... live off of on freedom of your book a boom in ... so those are the\nKinds of a new format that him and other creatures like him are really innovating in their attempt to reach new audiences to reach a young Muslims in ways that they will actually find compelling\nBut ... is just one of many prominent figures in the middle east right now and they don't all share the same ideas\nPrecisely because the Islamic television sector is largely privately owned and privately funded there exists a wide spectrum of theological an ideological orientations on Islamic television\nIslamic television is not a model if there's a wide diversity of viewpoints and religious scholarship that is regularly aired\nLet me think about extremism we also have to think about it's opposite which is moderation and the idea of religious moderation has a very long history within the Muslim world including in the pre modern era\nBut what moderation means and what voices get labeled as extremist is is not a stable thing it's it's constantly changing\nBut one thing is clear is that today for the vast majority of Muslims ISIS is an extremist group or in the sense that it's norms and practices are beyond the pale of what\nA most Muslims would agree their religion teachers and so when it comes to efforts to combat ISIS you're going to see a lot of cooperation among groups that normally don't get along\nAnd Islamic television preachers see themselves as having a very important role in this regard\nOr because they see their main role as teaching Muslims what Islam really means or what it really entails\nBut most of combating violent ideologies isn't always a huge priority for these creatures she says that's because relatively few people are actually recruited to join ISIS\nBeen a lot of panic lately about the recruitment success of uh\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by extending the firm Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices in the home\nThis is really an unfounded panic even Tunisia which has sent the most young people to ISIS as of last year it sent six thousand people not to be just population is twelve million\nAnd you can begin to to put the number of six thousand in perspective and that's the biggest the biggest so sort of a country that has sent young people to ISIS and I think that the biggest counter narrative\nTwo groups like ISIS and their extremism actually comes from the reality that the vast majority of ISIS victims have been other Muslims are not just Shiite Muslims but actually Sunni Muslims\nIn the U.S um we tend to focus on ISIS attacks in in western countries but ISIS has mostly been very active in Middle Eastern countries in November last year I says carried out one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Egyptian history where basically killed three hundred people praying in a mosque\nIn a town of only seven hundred people\nSo my self half the population of of of this village the biggest victims of terrorism committed by Muslims are actually other Muslims and so I think what we need\nIs less religious counter narrative is because those are alive and well I'm more of a treatment of the context that allow violent ideologies and the allergies to flourish and this would mean addressing structural problems like\nEconomic inequality political corruption as well as the human devastation brought by western military intervention in the region\nAnd I think you know us as American citizens we have an opportunity to hold our government accountable\nFor the ways in which his policies un actions in the middle east have actually created a breeding ground for groups like ISIS [noise]\nThat's he asked me mom she's a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan [noise]\nIt's obvious that the media landscape in the middle east is vast and that means that for an outsider it's really hard to understand the U.S has tried to harness the power of the media there in order to promote its own interests but there are things us policymakers just don't get about how religious and political issues on line in the middle east\nThat's according to Nathan Brown he's a professor of political science at George Washington university\nWhat the United States is concerned about is often immediate security goals and it might be having to do is say the Israeli Palestinian conflict there might have to do with Syria might have to do with Yemen so what we will sometimes do is come in and say okay this person is with us on\nThe Palestinian issue with this government is with us on Yemen and therefore it sort of back them across the board and what we miss in the process is that there's much much deeper dialogue going on that\nThe divisions are not really over short term policy issues but over long term concerns about the place of religion in public life about who has the authority to interpret Islam and that sort of thing and so we tend to be very short term and very clumsy and the way that we intervene in these things\nAnd a good example of that might be Saudi Arabia officially an ally despite its harsh treatment of dissidents and the lack of free speech there\nI think the American policy reaction has been very very short term and focus when ... been filming in Saudi Arabia talks this way when I'm just like to see the the president of
