entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser\nOr not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's an algae beats he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore it really is to me why the shock yeah that I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of ban\nIt steady drumbeat to get ... to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she dropped it ... that that really lengthy\nThen all of a sudden Sunday she dropped his Instagram posed with really lengthy almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming mid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people really look up to her so\nThere's a lot of support there's also of course there's kind of just movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so they kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou know tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now [noise]\nI think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world\nShe didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now or as long as you're being played on pop radio and she'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has his country than she did still want you appeal to them but I think she probably did feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day\nAnd I always say that that I had her mind summit laid back\nLike Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states yes she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after that she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nUnless you didn't say but those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her in a meet and greet line\nWhen she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark\nOn her [noise] Emily yard is an entertainment reporter for the Washington Post thanks very much for joining us today I think you\nKnow

interactive where Andrew Jones is the cofounder welcome thank you thank you also don't just make this clear this report is predicting really the same consequences of climate change that previous reports had been predicting but this report says these consequences will happen sooner yeah\nThat's the basic idea and when I read it for the first time I was struck with the urgency and I really laid out which such precision the hearing now element of this problem and not do it for the grandkids\nSo many of these effects that you just mentioned sit around twenty forty also I think you and I plan to be here around twenty I order and they do yeah so what this is a kind of sharing now impacts of the scientists were writing about\nSo what would it take to avert this I mean this report is saying we basically have a deadline coming up in about Twenty years are are real changes feasible within that timeframe absolutely like this you\nHear some of those studies in it makes you think\nGosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatch them Netflix but if you think about it facing this kind of impossibility is really something to extend what humans were made for and the report lays out really

tech considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology that's in our phone in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure or is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she they facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome and now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just want smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed ... use of the software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would you really quite well with well controlled facial image is when they leave nation as good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know changing agents do on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better\nAt the task you know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as ...\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images that for a particular person and an accurate labels and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make\nThe Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically it's quite simple\nIf you had equal representation a faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question so even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the

Californians and one of the big concerns is housing and general affordability and the state where to stand on that well\nThey hit a certain amount of agreement Tiffany are they both agreed that there isn't enough housing being built and that it is a supply and demand issue I think both agreed also that one of the reasons that there is less housing built is red tape local control\nWas that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had\nThis rising tide of really dangerous\nYou had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry had\nBeen organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and as he does these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they did they were front page news they were\nSongs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food is just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's this in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressman or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizers\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fight to expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments

since the New York times ran an expose a alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws that key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct any well training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places the rules apply to all employers regardless the size of this comes as news\nTo Peter shell the tone of sheltering deli in Brooklyn I haven't heard about it and you can\nCall in Chelsea has six employees and says sexual harassment has never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says we never really had a policy or even written down now that it's on his radar he says he'll comply\nYou know we're more bureaucratic hurdles\nThat we're not used to certainly for the cause of course\nFrank Kenya is Rochester base human resources consultant his clients are small businesses he doesn't even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with at this point\nKenya estimates over half of the state's small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise the New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\n... has to somehow with comedy questions including lived trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd requires feedback from employees about the training and the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York city you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one guy that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is in New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nAnd you don't have training that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protected category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but ... he says that does not mean employers
