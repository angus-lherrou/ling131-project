pitched game to that game for the Boston Red Sox who Babe Ruth made without Babe Ruth you might have heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees are back\n... this goalie okay with them and they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's this historic\nMatch up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team somehow they miss each other when they both bend in the world series was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them two thousand eighty\nStill looking back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how does this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life

changing lanes extra innings I've met with the scene and spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the scene is different because they went out many Machado I mean this is Ben they're often said or eat or he's at shortstop they lost quite secret during the season now they have a child and then really in their face I don't it's not quite ...\nIts Walker Mueller so adding Walker bealer to be able to be honest and one of the best picture that we've seen in the national league they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what do they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had\nReally positive that a lot of reasons to celebrate but I mean the patriots and the red Sox but this is arguably one of the best regular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without\nA doubt they were the best thing that baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want to hide your mate games yeah you get an award you get a

I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nRight now in an update on the migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border [noise] two hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data and analyze by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification\nLike one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five a number about one twenty\nHe shouldn't have been thinking that way but all he said to us was I cannot bring our child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite femur right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents would\nYou have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of the gangs and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government had no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we\nBelieve leaking learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR News that you couldn't see this next story coming it's about ... to take advantage of the people who believe them from member station W.

let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nMaking their way to Mexico in hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and\nTom not letting them in now it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with a caravan\nSay they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nAh there's no evidence then as Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nIllegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first lost his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the
