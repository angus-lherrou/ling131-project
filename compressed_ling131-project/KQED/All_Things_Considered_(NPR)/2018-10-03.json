and while you're doing is he's talking about gun rights and he said he'd support gun supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these\nAnd then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says you're so I'd like to see some foreign do this and and the ads on national attention he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really\nIt seemed like a rising politician the Democratic party\nAnd his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional letter message a tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nOr that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had\nBeen having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization who started something called a let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment and that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about um support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nI mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh I mean I Can't think of a politician who disclosed this sort of thing
