DNA connection from some of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent in two separate packages those appear to match sale because well\nA and authorities have also identified a identified a Twitter

Ari Shapiro hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest land under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here see motion all yeah I'm sure\nIt is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIs a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary\nAnd you know crying all the way which are likely to somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and step son the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout now at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated he writes a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over and I'm good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did it the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing the oil and always great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her nap workplace\nPolicies that eighty see

training to be a nurse and that reflect the bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field group\nAnd was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes it's very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent\nUsed to being able to to depend on my cell and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once doesn't that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle that so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had at willow run\nHow many of them would you say\nAre in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled in on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets any kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was heading and many of them have never found their footing\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like AT T's really you know that's how I can kind of like he's in the it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all the issues and just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nThey just say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and

trees like the leaves on the street it's kinda cool kind of eerie and\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front

patrol ... we've\nHeard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehension that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling math\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect\nIce will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior and that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped him are overwhelmed\nImmigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing some are paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details\nAbout that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president it attempted what he attempted with the travel ban then he'll give that his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John\nYou about [noise] get\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong case thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports they were assigned to control trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that's historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economist expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks aren't growing fast might like that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmerican standard and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips in him down and restaurants more Maloof is American CEO of I G the hotel group than our own holiday learning can in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr set records around our Labor Day and the moral David share and fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more for protect spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just consumers who were spending more government spending was also walked Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point andme eager number\nDespite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... who is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer rail you're starting to see some headwinds appearing before the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that is steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people in businesses over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nJak also cites say gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what ... calls say growing spirit of protectionism right now\nKnow the economy is trade there is what ... calls they growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated\nThere's no telling what impact it will have but for now Americans are working in spending and that is keeping the growth rate strong\nJim Zarroli NPR News [noise]\nYou're
