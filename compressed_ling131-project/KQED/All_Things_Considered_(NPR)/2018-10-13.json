the Florida we stir industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two times look like today\nWell you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo we drove into day my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high winds up there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees were stood at\nA here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main minutes along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as it were there before the storm we also some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday it took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and they have to not yeah yeah I watched it out\nThere also in that area there's a

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor help for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's pasture ran a small church in is near and western turkey for years and years a\nBut after a turkey had just failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric or to the Gulen turkey blames for that to attempt\nTo us that the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president reject type aired on said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with everyone and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they love each sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is to release a pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us turkey relationship it's\nWe used to pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that for incentives an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington niche and you're delivering it thirty five fighter just to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric or to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder the Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia here and just tumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe democracy will get case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul we can\nTake the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nHe was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag of free throws had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why ships getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi on tree to lay which makes ... in fact the machine Scott uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of their products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to\nComment okay find things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so there's always a wholesale cost the Fritos have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a freak though there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that kind of afraid of is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in suits daddy's she got the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with well food prices\nIs a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is in things like labor and rent\nAnd transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets and MIT analyzes food companies including Pepsi and another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a low minimum um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbout companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking him going category alive many of the other food categories and bad allow\nCompanies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cats the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nSupport for Planet Money comes from transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally\nThree million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their ...\nAll Fritos considered from NPR News I'm Alex\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October ninth through November fourth after you got to meet you in or freedom theater and Jim ... death dot com\nUm so there is this naming and shaming in providing details that level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nThat parents garden ... thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown up by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no alternative conclusion other than the Russians face was ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they would suddenly underwriters says the ...\nTo a guy like Eric towler that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called battling cat his job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it\nSomething like digital researcher digital investigator digital something\nProbably works told his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line they've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operations unfold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that phrase\nI'm the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of rushing just random Russian guys going through it and kind of fight saying if it's like a military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person to put a photo shows are boy ...

into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nAnd that was the shooter was made famous by New York Knicks great walk Clyde Fraser and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletic she industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going to get ahead\nSo why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been white Twenty years since there last basketball she liked him\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broken after two years and so they put out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'm going with a big part of the appeal was happening in with the players today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think of anything for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark\nTheir basketball's really a big way in terms of being a global granted well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer\nYeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year in life you had about ... percent of the week wearing their shoes last model okay step in and combat that is pretty common bond okay [laughter] yeah you have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix to the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with the darned into cousin so you\nKnow in terms of offers there's been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their immigrant\nHow big of a gamble in this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the bigger the bigger hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases the guys that were dropped either\nYou know or a bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media as she's gotten a chance to check up on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever [laughter] and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken that made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court yes\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary

other day and out of the nine guys pulled aside and they have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why I did was shoot me as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself or going out a couple of hours so\nThere really winning it on their players counts and a big part of their ... their news but\nThey don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe

news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report that summer

Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirch state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds recognition what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the rangers uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is and the knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people in Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of

you think the last you change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them well and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when a number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take\nThat much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nKnow what your officers report

stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fad for forty years until twenty ten Duncan was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush to precedent and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials happened defending the sad from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think than at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them from\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending where\nI think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution much acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight\nGroup why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald ... the former vice chairman
