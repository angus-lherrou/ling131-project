years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be bold rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would as an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks\nDid not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at at that point from the perspective of\nIt means a lot a lot\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks\nStart eighty

[noise] [noise] ... ... ... ...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry what's your company do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith hosts the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin how he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou know just like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues that went to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decrease Uber's revenues and I went to two percent which we tested apologies involved sort of commitments to do better or are not always thought about a commitment to the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then there might if he didn't do better because then maybe it's maybe for some of them had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm not in our data\nSo [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect it\nInteresting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability I\nThink part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripted risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter] yeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we were which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out to the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may outside of it was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carry that were into

and candy take on a whole new significance\nOn and we've we've which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to so we were we were hoping\nTo figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may have backfired a bit was a message to sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think that's like carry over into personal relationships things I Am so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your ears and flowers and flowers and candy because I always take\nOn a whole new significance um did it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nPeople thought always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious\nI think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always are might be skeptical

FM San Francisco and kick you we I FM north highland Sacramento\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises the question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let interstates by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all in the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis and Canada CBP still have not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nBe still clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's crystal clear at this\nClear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed bottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to persist that there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one

Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida is not a bunch of high rises out a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks that fish

shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John history no structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north than Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand when speed one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds seemed in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm has local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging

the street from President Trump's Washington hotel and newly released batch of emails indicates the president influenced a federal decision to keep the FBI on the same site\nTrump's involvement in the fate of the property is being investigated by Democrats on the house oversight committee who are concerned about possible presidential conflicts of interest NPR's Peter Overby reports\nJust all has to do with the FBI and it's old dilapidated headquarters in D.C the buildings just across Pennsylvania Avenue from President Trump's hotel\nThe general services administration the federal government real estate manager plan to move the FBI to bigger facilities in Washington suburbs door hero buying uh GST official explained the financial angle to a house hearing in twenty Thirteen\nWe believe that Pennsylvania avenues site has instead of potential for higher and better use than as a headquarters of a federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing deal the FBI site but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail here he is in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWere very very complex for luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people [noise] it's almost finished\nIn last winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere it's

Overby NPR News Washington [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News historically white Americans have distanced themselves\nFrom many non white ancestry they might have now many are claiming some because they're proud on some because they're trying to tap into benefits designed for minorities so what exactly make someone a minority as Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team tells us it's complicated\nPresident Trump has been mocking Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren ... that she has Native American ancestry since twenty sixteen\nThat's so is the best Warren\nMassachusetts is represented by Pocahontas\nWarren\nMassachusetts was represented by Pocahontas drugs are not happy [noise] those came from\nFox and CNN and there were lots more in a video released this week Warren clapped back\nI'm not I'm rolling and try and only trying to determine tribal citizenship I understand members of my family history is my family history\nSo she had her DNA sequence which we deals Native American ancestry one says she took the test to prove their families tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth\nBut not everybody test for personal validation\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy was in the news recently because Los Angeles times investigation revealed that since two thousand his brother in law William wages was awarded more than seven million dollars and no big government and other federal contracts that were designed to go to disadvantage minorities he\nDeclined to test but from family lore wages claims to be one age Cherokee\nUp in Washington insurance broker Ralph Taylor has a suit pending in the Ninth Circuit because the state item and minority business certification for a program designed to help minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as a multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is the minority then\nThe question really you're asking is that a DNA test tell him what his identity as or tell us what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times now France had DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others are seeing them\nNielsen says home DNA test or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't design them for that\nYou know that sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right under also um profit making entity\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take seriously on the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to start at the counterpoint to discrimination\nBecause the lived experience of minorities can be learned by swapping a cheek or spitting into a cheap\nKaren Grigsby Bates NPR News [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News in here now with your cake you will see
