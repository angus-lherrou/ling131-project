have news tonight on Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal could show Jay\nSaudi Arabia has confirmed on state TV that he is dead ... had been missing since October ... that's when he was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Seventeen Days ago\nMultiple news reports had pointed to his likely death that this marks the first official confirmation NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me now from Istanbul Hi Peter I'm Mary Louise what details do we have from the Saturday announcement\nVery few details of the Saudi press agency is saying Eighteen people have been arrested as the investigation is ongoing or but as you mentioned there is the first official confirmation\nOr from Riyadh that jump off the show gee uh is dead he was last seen going into the Saudi consulate here in Istanbul on October ... seconds\nAnd according to the Saudi press agency after he entered the consulate there was a fight to dispute that broke out and that led to his death we we don't know any more details on that right now\n[noise] study TV is reporting you mentioned Eighteen Saudi nationals arrested and among them they also mentioned a general and a royal court advisor who've been sacked from their positions do we know who these people are are any details about them\nWell a major general Ahmed Asiri was first mentioned to my knowledge in a New York times report this morning that talked about\nHim as someone who might be being lined up to take the blame for this a lot of questions have been pointing of course at the royal family ah including a crown prince Mohammed bin some on as the man who was in pretty much total control of Saudi Arabia\nAnd of many folks have been saying that this probably could not have happened without his knowledge and possibly without his order\nA but at this point the Saudis are saying that this intelligence officer and advisor to saw him on a has been sacked and also side could Tony who's an advisor to the real court\nSo possibly a strategy to to uh put some scapegoats out there and the questions were made in terms of who was giving the orders for this operation let me ask you this Peter what do we know about timing why put this out in the middle

this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both of US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that\nChallenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called ... it's about eighty percent Latino [laughter]\n[noise] I'm In a restaurant or eating pork does out got as and tacos and\nI bumped into a guy who gives the Republicans somehow always his hand or home especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon Baron owns a small business repairing floor is he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump's stance\nFor security for her you know you need certain order and in your home\nYou know the issues that came with the wall you know building a wall it is a good idea because I just installed not even two weeks or boys security door on my door I already have a door\nBut I Would have better doors when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow the door and makes me feel safer it made me think\nYou know that you know it does make sense more more metal barricades\nThough ... you know [noise]\nBut step outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of money they're coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world who are you gonna go status you seem to accuse been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you ask me\nMe who's ordering all that or you know top and it's a gym\nThere is reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJoseph Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nThat Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn

public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to do when the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us\nCitizens twenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join their teeth [noise]\nI'm at a baseball diamond in a small part in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support I'm Hispanic so don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party he mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship but it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk\nAround with their district as he knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes on the on the river on the Republican running for real and I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is a show that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nOne right now I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan immigrants from Mexico\nAnd this is an issue where I go sideways with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI asked ... if he thinks the Republican Party position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and when you didn't increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one that Trump in ...\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my condition that position is what I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug you see on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am vouch for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party and the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way cheetah\nThey see what's going on to see how they treated us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over there\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR News stay with us for take you read the news with Tiffany camera I after a traffic update from Julie ... fish\nI think there is a lot of pressure on President Trump to take a harder line and he has hardened his wine a bit publicly said there should be a severe punishment and all of that but all the indications from the administration or\nThat they really do not want to break with the Saudis they're not ready to take on a the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman or because they\nSeem to see him as an ally in Trump is suggested that he is a personal\nOw ow so it is not known only to the president Congress has a role in this as President Trump has pointed outlets Senator Lindsey Graham has weighed in Republican Senator Graham has weighed in tonight saying he was very skeptical\nOf the Saudi version of events Brea is you know there's been a drumbeat for sanctions there's been a drumbeat from Congress about taking a tougher line are you watching for that drew me to get louder\n[noise] yeah I mean that honest thing remains to be seen I think ultimately though that this incident doesn't necessarily mean that we should reorient our entire Middle East strategy\nI mean at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post that he was also a personal friend of us I'm a bin Laden and was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood doesn't individual you know we have to take all of that into account and I also think that when you are dealing when he was ...\nAs a journalist for the Washington Post and who was a U.S resident and do it now appears was murdered I Know the show to cancel it\nAnd of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that we're interested in doing um when you are talking about the middle east we're talking about a lot of bad actors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nSponsorship of the kick you read the live stream by super micro Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it in for Mike Rowe dot com\nHuman rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our ducks in a row and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over that I find it\nReally disturbing to go back to his youth this person who has been a as close the borders search of the word liberal in terms of demanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tar him as a young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is\nThis is a former propaganda that can be is being used to justify a soft line here people should read his final piece for the Washington Post which was really powerful call for freedom\nIn the Arab world that was really overweight and white and blue short of column and that's what he has been and that is the man who was killed\nLet me ask you both to set aside for a moment questions about whether his past is relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U. S. and focused on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis for the United states with a Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations\nFree I think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really matched up here um you know they've\nArrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they've arrested and dismiss five others\nSo I have to change if they made a statement from Saudi state TV yeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking it seriously um I think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat\nAmerican permanent residents that are living in their country\nEJ I'm lost tortillas thoughts on the where this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I think the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress or she just said as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that mom had been some some on NBS as he is known\nTo ground friend\nIs an hour ... former ah I think this has really brought home the shortage of his regime or that or will pressure of his image will never be the same as it was a when he started out and was getting a lot of remarkably good pressure that this is a big problem for him going forward\n[noise] lots of

book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell ... mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little the library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her\nAnd was it a hit right from the start actually know very little tasked by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Rock and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting them like seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that and it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me the only people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails with say I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people open the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really look out reading and sharing stories\nAs a doorway conforming relationship you know when I spoke with Todd in person on the phone he first how energized he was an art project especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now are too much from the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has

that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging may never had the next day seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there and you can share it outlined reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd fall when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he stood out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from books or her reading he was being a champion for community new friendships new ideas new projects bring to life as a result of his idea back when he won it\nWell ... thank you for talking to us

the idea that that a committee led by Mohammad bin ... on the crown prince is going to investigate something that he has been implicated in is going to\nLead to a lot of questions I think around the

Saudis have said that I'm Eighteen people have been arrested now in this case um\nSeveral people have been relieved from their duties and that includes um a royal court advisor who's\nClose to crown
