investigation on friday he said today he has been having a lot of talks with the White House app had the other key Republican holdouts here\nThe Judiciary Committee asked the White House to have the FBI investigate current and credible allegations President Trump seems to be referring to Republicans on this so what's our best understanding of how the Senate Republicans define current incredible\nLindsey Graham gave a definition of this over the weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all of the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party and it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party\nHere's the thing that's unclear is whether the FBI could or would broaden and talk to college classmates who have come forward saying that Kevin I wasn't telling the truth when he testified that is drinking habits and other things like that a flake was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants to scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out what we can find out\nAt the same time though a set of Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them in the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence\nOr that undermines what what Ford said and back what Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo from that prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell saying that based on the lack of hard evidence a reasonable profit prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh\nAt this point how much control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process\nWell here's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they want it to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation they didn't do either of those things because a

briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a\nParking spaces are empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out without eating and briefing books when it open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern in the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was\nKind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about\n[noise] so the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election do when shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually\nKind of a month after the election the Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kinda lobbyist who was they're mainly to\nRoot out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example\nStart to turn up inside of the department\nBut the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from ... to do that any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most\nAnd be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency is supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example or inside the department of commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades gotten extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane and tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem with that person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem when the person has an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and the downside to knowledge ... what is that upside ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who made a career out of those are people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump's still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro it looks like North America will remain a free trade zone after all late last night Canada agree to joined the U.S and Mexico in an updated version of a North American free trade agreement\nIt will no longer be called NAFTA but rather the U. S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deal ever negotiated but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal from called it a positive step for both the country and the world\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern\nUp to date and balance trade agreement in the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nIn signing on to the deal Canada agreed to open up its long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter\nCheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nBook Canada is still expected to buy more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the us views as artificially low prices\nIn exchange for these concessions the U.S agreed not to scrap NAFTA Arab process for resolving trade disputes even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau\nWhen you're trading partners ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\nThe U.S and Mexico had reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night just hours before a White House deadline Walter do cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized the threat of a trade agreement that left candidate on the sidelines has been averted\nWhat I can say is that free and fair trade in North America is in a much more stable place than it was yesterday\nMarkets rallied on the news with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining nearly two hundred points Trump Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto are expected to
