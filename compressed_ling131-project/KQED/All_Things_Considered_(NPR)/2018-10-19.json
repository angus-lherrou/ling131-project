childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly stole him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegate said that he stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans\nOccasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years that something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAt the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for a pillow seem to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there she it turns out there and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams ... keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates likely Adams that many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election

and newly released batch of emails indicates the president influenced a federal decision to keep the FBI on the same site\nTrump's involvement in the fate of the property is being investigated by Democrats on the house oversight committee who are concerned about possible presidential conflicts of interest NPR's Peter Overby reports\nThis all has to do with the FBI and it's old dilapidated headquarters in D.C the buildings which across Pennsylvania Avenue from President Trump's hotel\nThe general services administration the federal government real estate manager plan to move the FBI to bigger facilities in Washington suburbs Dorothy row buying uh GST official explained the financial angle to a house hearing in twenty Thirteen\nWe believe the Pennsylvania avenues site has the potential for higher and better use them as a headquarters of the federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing the old FBI side but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail theories in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWith very very complex for luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people it's almost finish as more\nAnd last winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and GPS day the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere this spring GST administrator Emily Murphy told a house committee Trump had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild\nThe the destruction that we got came from the FBI and the FBI detracting she attached to watch for climate to be but the\nEmails

listening to all things considered from NPR News\nHistorically white Americans have distanced themselves from many non white ancestry they might have\nNow many are claiming some because they're proud and some because they're trying to tap into benefits designed for minorities so what exactly make someone a minority as Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team tells us it's complicated\nPresident Trump has been mocking Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says search and that she has a Native American ancestry since twenty sixteen oh God\nThat's so Warren, Massachusetts is represented by Pocahontas Ezra\nNot happy [noise] this came from\nFox and CNN and there were a lot more in a video released this week Warren clapped back\nI'm not enrolled in and try and only trying to determine tribal I understand that my family history in my family history\nSo she had her DNA sequence which we deal to Native American ancestry wine says she took the test\nClinched which we deal to Native American ancestry one says she took the test to prove their families tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth\nBut not everybody test for personal validation\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy was in the news recently because Los Angeles times investigation revealed that since two thousand his brother in law William wages was awarded more than seven million dollars and no big government and other federal contracts that were designed to go to disadvantage minorities he\nDeclined to test but from family lore wages claims to be one age Cherokee\nUp in Washington insurance broker Ralph Taylor has a suit pending in the Ninth Circuit because the state denied among minority business certification for a program designed to help minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as a multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is that a DNA test tell him what his identity as retail and yet that's what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times now France had DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA test or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't design them for that\nYou know that sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right under also um profit making entities\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take serious way on the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to start at the counterpoint to discrimination\nBecause the lived experience of minorities can be learned by swapping a cheek for speeding into it you Karen Grigsby Bates NPR News [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\nI'm John Yoo in Boise idaho
