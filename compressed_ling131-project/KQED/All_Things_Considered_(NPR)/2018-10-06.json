News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy hops in in Washington\nThat name Brett Kavanaugh is likely to be in our lives for decades he will change the balance of the Supreme Court replacing the courts swing vote Anthony Kennedy and he may yet have an impact on control of Congress and how much President Trump is able to accomplish for the remainder of his presidency\nThis hour how did we get here what does Kavanaugh's confirmation mean for the Supreme Court and what are the ramifications for the country a country that is in the midst of the me too movement and a month away from the mid term elections\nLet's start with the defining moment on the Senate floor when America found out that Brett Kavanaugh was all but guaranteed to sit on the court\nMr President I Will vote chicken from judge Kaplan\nMaine Republican Senator Susan Collins with her closing argument in support of Kavanaugh that came after a contentious three months that began on July night\nHe's a brilliant jurors with a clear ineffective writing style universally regarded as one of the finest and sharpest legal minds of our time\nPresident Trump had promised to nominate judges who oppose abortion rights candidate on his name came from a list given to the president by the federalist society an advocacy group with the conservative agenda with Kevin I'm told senators that he viewed the landmark roe versus Wade decision settled law\nAs a judge it is an important precedent of the Supreme Court by it I mean roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey been reaffirmed many times Casey is precedent on precedent which itself is an important factor to remember\nAnd I understand the significance of the issue the jurors credential issue and I understand the significance as best I can I always try you know I Do hear of the real world effects of that decision as I tried to do of all the decisions of my core of the Supreme Court\nHe also promised to be fair and impartial judge\nBeing a good judge means paying attention to the words that are written the words of the constitution the words of the statutes that are passed by Congress not doing what I Want to do\nIn early September Democrats used there two days of questioning Kevin a to point out that they weren't given enough information about his record but after the first round of hearings Kavanaugh's confirmation looked like a sure thing\nUntil a week later when the Washington Post published a story about allegations from Christine Blasey Ford who claimed Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when both were in high school she agreed to testify about it before the Senate Judiciary committee in one of the most watched congressional hearings in decades\nNamed motivation and cutting for ways to be helpful and fight facts how Mr cabinet accents had damaged my life so that you could take into a serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed\nIt is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr cabinet as there is just sit on the Supreme Court my responsibilities to tell you the truth\n\nWe're back now with a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy helps in in Washington so what does the nomination and confirmation process we've witnessed over the past three months I mean for the Supreme Court the conservative Kavanaugh will replace Justice Anthony Kennedy who was for three decades the swing vote on the court\nWe heard from retired Justice John Paul Stevens this week is Ninety eight was appointed by Gerald Ford and said Canada should not be on the court\nIs of things in the road and he should have been for a when it was another one that I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nYou know took Berg an extraordinary moment of former justice saying that about a nominee\nWell what he said was that because Kavanaugh had framed his entire critique at his the second round of hearings as a partisan attack not just on Democrats but I'm liberal groups and I'm like liberal activists that all those people when they come to the Supreme Court\nCould rightly maintained that they will get a fair and unbiased hearing from him and you saw Brett Kavanaugh today the wall Street Journal tried to walk back is what he said call his emotional comments but he didn't say specifically which ones in any event Steven's point was that uh\nThat he might have to recuse himself now I think that's a very highly unlikely\nPossibility given Kavanaugh's demeanor\nHow does that happen also that of justice accuses himself or herself it usually happens when there's a set of rules you know let's say you're supposed to recuse yourself if you have any financial interest\nIf your family is involved in any remote way if you're a so I'm very close friend has some financially or something like that there's a whole set of canon of ethical conduct but\nBecause the Supreme Court is the last place to go and if you were queues yourself there only eight and they could be tied\nUm the justices try very hard not to have those conflicts you can't take back a conflict like this and and I doubt that he's going to bow out out of a lot of if any cases because of what he said\nWell Tom Goldstein President Trump has had a number of rallies where people chant lock her up about Hillary Clinton and Brett Kavanaugh I got up there or before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge on behalf of the Clintons\nCould he be a an impartial judge in a case that involved the Clintons were a left wing group he pointed out left wing groups as well well\nThe Clintons might be a very special case a given also his involvement with Ken Starr investigation in terms of things involving liberals and conservatives and yet there's I think zero percent chance that he's going to recuse himself it would be in in essence an admission that he can't be neutral in the front issues like abortion affirmative action same sex marriage and the like\nI Can't see him doing that I think that\nWhat he is likely to do is probably try and find some opportunities ah like he has recently with the editorial that he wrote to try and asked for some sympathy from Republican understanding exactly kinds of pressure that he was under and when he was feeling in terms of how his family was\nUnder the spotlight with these attacks and try and kind of walk back the sense that he's\nWe've decent tax and try and kind of walk back the sense that he has some active person and get back into the mode where in his original testimony when he first came before the the committee and really gave us this air of being a truly neutral arbiter of questions that come in front of him\nI Want to go through some key issues here that people are thinking about a as they contemplate what Kevin I Will mean for the Supreme Court abortion first of all Nina what do you think this is going to mean for the issue of abortion\nWell I think it's pretty clear that at at least\nThere are five justices on the court who now will begin to whittle away at abortion rights they may not overtly reverse roe versus Wade but we could end up in this situation in which in those days where abortion is ... that that abortion rights are\nAre popular they remain and in those days where they are highly unpopular they know there is no longer a clinic there because they can't function under the rules that are laid down by the state law\nWhat about same sex marriage a Justice Anthony Kennedy a who is retiring did retire or authored that decision Tom Goldstein about same sex marriages that issue going to come up against well\nI don't think in terms of whether there is a right to same sex marriages would be very surprising to see the court kind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just playing the joints\nWhere you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise of the right who knows what that means you can fill into that whatever it is you want almost and that's why I'm more conservative court can allow more state regulations but there is a right to same sex marriage it's a binary light switch on light switch offing I Can't see them doing it\nWhere there isn't necessarily a right to\nIs all kinds of things that go with it it's like a king you require the floor is too is against same sex marriage to design\nA floral arrangements for your wedding or as we saw a ... a cake wedding cake or a photographer to take photographs or go to the photography studio and have them developed photographs of your same sex wedding\nI mean most states have laws that require\nEqual treatment of everybody you can't just pick and choose who your customers are as long as they behave themselves\nBut their ... you know so far that remains the law of the land as it is but unless Congress were to pass a federal statute requiring equal treatment of\nUm same sex couples for example it's not necessarily true that that would ... that would be true everywhere\nRight one thing when you're likely to see is a Supreme Court that's more sympathetic to religious objections to doing things for example involving abortion or same sex marriage in light\nThe county clerk who doesn't want to provide a marriage certificate that sort of thing the court right maybe there but the things that actually also help same sex couples really feel like they're equal maybe more in question what\nAbout the issue of presidential power President Trump is currently under investigation that Robert Mueller investigation is going on ... will will cabinet being on the court make any difference there\nWell we we know that he has said things that are at least ... the police questioned the correctness of than famous Nixon tapes decision which would which required the ... President Nixon to turn over tape recordings that incriminating him in the end that we're putting into an ongoing criminal investigation\nUh it is true he's also said that it's one of if he cited it in a list of one of the great cases showing the independence of the judiciary but\nHe also said things that may be set has said maybe it was wrongly decided that we really don't know where he is on that what we do know is that he's a very very strong advocate of executive power in a wide array of areas\nAnd even proposed at one point that Congress should pass a law that would exempt that President from criminal investigation or civil suits while he's president\nNow on this question he only has one vote obviously but I Do think you'll probably get a lot of respect for this he spent a lot of time the executive branch you spend it in the White House and it was part of the Ken Starr investigation and so his view of how disruptive this can be to the presidency to have you know criminal proceedings in Grand juries like may get a lot of attention from the other justices\nWhere is Kevin are going to fit a on the court in terms of the other conservatives you already have Justice Alito Justice Thomas now justice Gorsuch pretty reliable conservatives and ... as he become the swing vote on the corner Robert in it\nIn a technical sense there probably are some cases like the case involving Obamacare and we she cast the deciding vote but mostly\nObama and the other conservatives and in the court or at least pretty much in lockstep on the outcome I mean he dissented in gay marriage he dissented in gerrymandering he descended in a whole bunch of other you know ... ... in a whole bunch of other cases as long as Anthony Kennedy was on the court\nHe could move the balance board a little bit when he decided that this was a subject in which he agreed with the liberals to some extent or another there's nobody like that in the center of the court now there are four\nPretty liberal justices I Would call them to most liberals they would seem to be moderate liberals but they are on the liberal side and then five quite hardcore\nConservatives with chief justice Roberts I think really worried about the court institutionally not going too far too fast but\nUh that's probably what's holding him back I think\nYeah and I think the that ... that phrase too fast is probably where it's going to be you're going to achieve that\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nExtremely aggressive and partisan particularly over the course of the next say twelve months or so or he may not want to see cases overturned rat quite rapidly but he wouldn't mind seeing the law of all in a conservative direction\nFresh works is used by more than a hundred and fifty thousand companies around the world for their C. R. M. more at fresh works dot com or in special coverage on the cabinet vote this hour we'll bring you all things considered at six o'clock it's now twenty minutes before six\n\nThis is a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy hops in the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court comes on the year anniversary of the me too movement it also comes a month before the midterm elections which would determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the house and the Senate\nAnd how much President Trump will be able to get done for the remainder of his presidency\nNPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell start with you what does this mean for the key races coming up\nWhile the one thing that we are going to be watching very closely at what it means for Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota who voted no\nUh she was under a lot of pressure to support cabinet because she is running for reelection and a state that President Trump won with a very significant margin in twenty sixteen\nPolls had showed her slipping recently but she put out a statement saying that she was making a decision based both on the fact that she thought that his performance at that hearing was partisan\nAnd because she worried about the message it would send to women and young girls about the treatment of the way that we in America treat that acts\nIt would send to women and young girls about the treatment of the way that we're in an America treat the accusations of sexual assault\nShe is in a precarious situation here running against a very conservative House Republican who has strong name id in that state\nAnd she as far as I can understand it from talking to people that know her well made that decision here but that got decision may be a really big and you know may take a hit for her in the polls or the person I'm watching as Joe mansion in West Virginia who is the only Democrat who voted yes\nAnd he said that he you know Manhattan is looking out for what's right for West Virginia again a state that President Trump won fairly significantly in twenty sixteen\nDominican much in our NPR's lead politics editor ... is this going to impact the races of people who don't have to vote on this I'm thinking of people like ... or ... or who's running in Texas against Ted Cruz\nWell he's got his own an uphill battle and uh that's the fact that a Texas is Texas [laughter] that's a different situation but I think tells his right to zero in on some of these red state Republicans a red state Democrats who are running in places\nThat President Trump won you know Texas is among those kinds of places but first and foremost you gotta look\nA like a tells you mentioned that Heidi Heitkamp you know someone like John ... says hey you know he's seen in Montana in Montana seems fine in his race but Joe Donnelly who I really wonder if he would have rather\nKind of said nothing uh before saying no immediately after uh that Thursday hearing uh I don't think Democrats quite realized how this was going to fire up Republican white men in particular this\nUh you know our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll really showed a big shift among Republicans and it was driven by by men within the Republican Party\nOr who shifted very quickly\nAnd you know you have something like eighty percent of the Republican Party right now saying that the elections are a very important and that significant because that's basically a tie statistical tie with Democrats\nAnd Democrats had a ten point advantage on that over the summer\nNow does that remained this high or does that recede given the fact that cabinet looks like he will be confirmed and the fact is Democrats democratic women democratic men they have been fired up this entire time and are expected to stay at that level\nOkay well let's listen we've been talking to a a couple of strategist on each side here this is John ... a Republican strategist and here's what he thinks that this means\nWhat we found that in the last week is there certainly seems to be some Republicans come out I'm probably had is that particularly murder Republicans are not huge fans of this president he makes up for that oftentimes by getting conservative Democrats\nBut at least on a lot of the surveys I've seen in the last week a lot of them though number one that the Democrats overplay their hand that it wasn't even that they didn't believe professor Ford\nThey just were unhappy with a lot of the tactics that they saw the Democrats taking and felt that\nUh they were they were just nearly playing politics and I'm so it was interesting to a throat it's solidified the Republican Party at this and um I I think the question now is can they keep that sort of small momentum going all the way until election day\nOkay so that's a Republican strategist this is democratic strategist Anna Greenberg\nI think it's very helpful for Democrats I think it's going to galvanize\nWomen who are already feeling aggrieved\nBut I also think that the way from kind of double down and attacked Dr Ford rallies and I think having a pet I just think all of it with him and started fairly leaving confirmed in the end I'm cabinet that are perhaps even more\nKelsey I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today are talking with protesters outside the Supreme Court and outside the capital and some of them said to me\nI think he's going to be confirmed but that's just going to make me more excited to go out and vote for Democrats this November ... what do you think when you hear those two strategist who who is going to be more energized\nWell I think that Dominican as of right it's really hard to get people Democrats more energized than they already are\nI Do think that there is a question that has been raised not just Democrats but by some Republicans about how much this support for the president that we're seeing right now it's conditional on this issue\nWe seen that happen over and over and over again where a Republican voters in Republican elected officials will join Trump's side when he's doing something that they like and then quickly abandoned him when he does things like have a rally at the end says things that are politically incorrect or offensive\nAnd that's been the story of the relationship between traditional Republicans and this president since he was elected and in fact and he became the nominee so I it will be interesting challenge to see if that changes in the situation as well\nYou know what do you think\nI Want to wait and see I realize that I'm I'm a I'm really not helping you at all here but [laughter]\nI I don't actually know I'm inclined to think that this was a bump for Republican enthusiasm and it will recede at least partially because probably because some of the wives of these guys will tie them up and not let them go out and ... [laughter] met a girl is the\nIs you when you're talking to Jon breed bender who's a Republican and Anna Greenberg who's a democratic pollster both very good at what they do they're both looking at how this plays with their bases and like I was saying both bases are fired up over this right\nThe real issue I think for what's going to determine this election is how those swing voters those middle of the road suburban women\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nTo take back the house I think that what we've seen over the past week or two with how the Senate numbers have moved there is a very real possibility\nThat Democrats wind up losing out in the Senate where they lose a couple of seats and wind up taking back the house that's a very real possibility has been a real possibility from the beginning and it's starting to look more like the most likely scenario because\nThe ... the Republican leaning a in suburban women have really moved very sharply and been sharply opposed to President Trump\nA all along and there is a huge list of a potential targets in those are in those swing slash suburban district\nAnd the numbers in the Senate let's read reprise those er reprise that um there are\nA twenty six to ... twenty six Democrats up\nFor democratic Democrat and only nine and then only nine Republican seats and and and that ten of those are and overwhelmingly resonates so out of the Democratic seats the of the seats the Democrats have to hold on to her and overwhelmingly red states\nIt's a it's a huge uphill climb\nWell it's worse than that it's actually the worst landscape ever for a Senate map that any party has ever faced since the direct election of senators\nI guess Lindsey Graham would say it's it's hell and beyond health [laughter] so so ... for Democrats were in the midst of course of the me too movement and even during this entire nomination process for Brett Kavanaugh\nTo executives at CBS News became the latest men to be ousted ah it because of allegations of of a sexual misconduct let's say\nPresident Trump has been accused himself Brett Kavanaugh as we know has been accused they it it appears both have ... so far survived those allegations while so many other uh\nHave fallen Kelsey a one in three women\nHave been victims themselves of sexual assault one in six men I think as they watched everything that went on how does that play I mean they they have personal experience with the kinds of things that Christine Blasey Ford was talking about\nYeah and I think that one of the things that we're seeing is that there and women are finding more space to have this conversation and it's important to remember\nChoir choir choir October twenty six through twenty eight more at fourteen forty dot org
