religion reporter Michelle ... founded parishioners there have been having some painful conversations in recent days and she's here to tell us more Michele thanks so much for joining us to our\nHow people see church there\nI think first that sacrament is typical of a lot of Catholic churches in that it doesn't make\nPolitical positions kind of central I mean there there is a sacrament like smaller groups where you have people who are a little bit more like minded who might be completely focused on\nDealing with immigration or the Muslim ban or algae Beatty rights but when they all get together I think people who go to Boston sacrament loving the fact that they have different types of people have different political persuasion you know it's an escape for a lot of people to a break from you know the intense\nContact gang but right now it's landed right in the middle of\nTheir parish what do you think is a larger message here about how they dealt with it\n[noise] um so the backdrop of this is this is a time of national crisis in the Catholic Church because of the clergy sex abuse issue but a couple of the major players in that\nIn Washington I mean the Catholic Church just went through the summer having the first car now in America ever to resign that was hard on the character who was a popular leader here in Washington until just a few years ago the person who succeeded him cardinal Donald Wuerl has been named pretty prominently in a critical\nUm grand jury report in Pennsylvania there's a lot of distrust including at Boston sacrament one or the priest sexually spoke out and called for cardinal Wuerl to step down historically they've managed to stay together I mean it's a very large healthy Paris has thirty four hundred households their programming school\nDown the huge program going on right now to try to talk about the abuse crisis so they have a lot of things to keep people from bailing but you you have a lot of Catholics who are just that's not where they're finding moral leadership anymore and people who just kind of stopped going\nYou mentioned in your piece that the priest there hasn't been addressing the elephant in the room directly

Indonesia the state department\nSaid last week that it will no longer issue visas to the same sex partners of foreign diplomats\nAnd employees have us based international organizations unless the partners are legally married before the end of the year a spokesperson from the state department said that the policy quote\nInsurance consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote but critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd these critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could face persecution back home but if they do not married some partners could face deportation James Wiley Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nAnd ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that\nYou had had first hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognize how did you navigate fact\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse\nWe were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is our main objective was to make sure that he had the fool\nImmunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were\nAnd there was much discrimination based on that you can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the people known CEO who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband\nBecause he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president and the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects\nNew position by the state department is a reversal of a policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for it to ... these are not the Trump Administration says as as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that compares to different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August filled that wasn't central that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognize marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U.S\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\n[noise] so you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way that would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow in figure out how to get married and I know their country and whether that is even something that's\nAn option that is James Wiley Bruce ... he was in ... to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand seventeenth he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global ambassador thank you so much for talking to well it's such a pleasure to speak with you and I wish you to have the best days\nNow to our

violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager at local McDonalds\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot in Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search want one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nIn a violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of the country's most dangerous jobs\nWe wanted to hear more about this uh we've contacted Maria however felt she is a professor police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know ... ... yes when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at those numbers we talking about four to something off he says that's the sad that something officer\nSo from my perspective it's really what drives they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what Dr phil fan there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turns that we as saying that is dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if you look at the most recent years we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer in meditation\nAnd we're looking at an investigative activity um whereas I handling you know passing this with the mental illness so it's not perfect violations ... and ... no longer than\nMost frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it if it were\nNot people who for people police officer says the nominal the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out there to oppress the police are biased racist than and I'm with Senate things the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years because of that on that police in the United states so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event then you have to cut the stuff out\nSo if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday event and in the sea and steps of the Supreme Court you sing police officers pushing the demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the governments that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take your anger out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the\nSoviet because empathy for the government as a police officer\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians often the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are that power at the ... that that that is definitely\nA training issue offices frequently a seat in the car and the police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that\nYou always have reasonable thing to do given that particular environment and you've been said and political development that might be putting their lives in danger so this is\nHow you approach and the problem and how we are close to the house\nAh well you know that it's a fast but\nWho is armed and dangerous I mean we have eight themselves and police agencies and when you have a ten thousand police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would help us make the negative perception of of policing is a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there is also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's not supposed to be on the acceptable\nThat nine officers in one year killed in a line of duty as an outcome most tremendous they detected because it was directed against them explicitly no democratic society should accept a nine police officer in one year in separate incidents killed by members of the topic to suss up so that can accept\nThat as Maria have ourselves she is a professor in the department of law and

major fifth fight involving a number of people right and the only guy wild when somebody snatched up someone way\nYeah exactly exactly and that's a that's a fascinating incident that now that's a late

a northerner or or trying to intimidate a northerner\nBut in Eighteen fifty eight is creeping up towards the civil war\nI'm really talking about a house divided by by that point you really have

he's going to punch grow and gross slams kit and knocks him flat and at that moment streams of southerners hump flooring across the house some of them probably to break things up more of them probably to join in\nBreed the kind of distressed in national governance national institutions and and other Americans in each other and boys I transferred jak [laughter] indeed\nDoes that do you think give us some perspective on where we might be today I mean people talk about being on the brink of a civil war I don't think that's the case but do you see similarities between the Eighteenth fifties in the present I Do\nI also do not think we're on the brink of civil war but I think there are moments and all of those moments of Seventeen nineties eighty fifties the Nineteen sixties those moments when Americans understand\nThis some kind of a shift happening in the climate the political cultural and social climate\nAnd it just raises the stakes of politics and makes it very hard I think people feel that if they don't give their all and do whatever it takes to get what they want that they're going to fundamentally lose the battle for all time if you look at the Seventeen nineties their politicians explicitly saying look I Know what the rules are\nBut to hell with the rules right now because if we follow the rules they're going to win so for the safety of the republic for the survival of the nation\nWe have to break rules and that kind of a climate and logic again clearly there's\nHauntingly familiar aspects of it to what we're experiencing now\nBecause what you're saying is that when people went into politics in those times and perhaps now in the press in what they think is happening is a fight over the soul of the country itself right\nDuring those moments precisely which is not to say that there aren't other fraud moments and that there aren't other moments of enormous change but I Do think you know the slavery struggle the civil rights struggle of the Nineteen sixties the question in the late Seventy nine is about precisely how democratic nation the nation would be\nUm all of those things are are sort of peak moments of decision and I think we're experiencing one of those moments now and as it's unfolding of course it's becoming ever more polarized and stark\nYou gotta let me add in the Eighteen nineties there which look very much old saying and also a reminder that we lived through all those times\nExactly well exactly and that's you know so we lived through them all and after you know in a sense you could say that those moments are kind of debate and not very pleasant kind of debate\nBut that we do live through them and there are decisions made and there are positive as well as negative repercussions to those kinds of moments sometimes\nFor change to happen you have to go through that kind of a you know what I Want to call it like a crisis like I almost like a let's say cleansing only but there has to be an extreme moment to open the door to change\nAnd I have to say on that note precisely I think we should end this interview and thank you very much for being here and giving us some hope for the future a nice to have

A. B. E. welcome hello and\nThank you very much for the invitation Venezuela is tearing itself apart a freely elected government has become increasingly authoritarian an economy based on one of the world's greatest reserves of oil is in tatters hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are now refugees can you walk us through how polarization contributed to this crisis\n[noise] yes I'm going to say that went through severe economic crisis in the Nineteen nineties with hyperinflation and tripling poverty rates entered the people\nRejected the political parties and felt like they were responsible that they had mismanaged things and had not done things to to redress that crisis and that they were corrupt themselves so they were open to an outsider candidacy of Google Chavez who came along in Nineteen Ninety eight and said look the problems are\nThese political elites who have been running things into the ground and spending your money and we need to change things up and renew our democracy and redistribute the oil wealth to the poor so many in the country bought that he was elected but he came in with a very transformative agenda and\nHe used a confrontational and very polarizing strategy to try to accomplish the change that he wanted to accomplish\nAnd as he did that he created a backlash they would have dueling massive protests in the street and in one of those shots were fired a number of people were killed in the military blame Chavez and removed him in a coup\nA which only lasted two days and he was brought back when his people came out into the street in the military change their mind and brought him back\nSo the confrontation came I think from the need for change from people suffering from that economic crisis and feeling like their political leaders were not paying attention to them\nWell you've written that when one party starts to dig in and refuses to compromise games the system it's really crucial that the other side doesn't do the same thing that it should continue to play by the rules but in the example of Venezuela but you just given us the government is pack the court and figured out ways to exclude the opposition from Congress\nIf the opposition tries to play by the rules and not just give the government license to run roughshod\nCertainly it does now but in the beginning the opposition had a chance and particularly after that coup when things had blown up and the last patients basically and went through a non democratic maneuver to remove him which was a military coup d'etat\nWhen that didn't work and he came back they had a chance to negotiate basic changes in the rules in who would be appointed to the courts and that kind of thing but instead they still wanted to focus on removing him from power\nA shot is Doug in himself so both sides dug in in this\nKind of existential fight to eliminate the other rather than walking back and trying to work together again and over time this\nPolitical fight that infused into the society so that the citizens themselves became just as divided in fact neighborhoods families were divided\nCaracas itself you would go to one area of town and the restaurants were only for the people who were you know anti shop as you go to another area of town and that was only for pro shop is people\nAnd people would be tackled and harassed if they tried to cross over so over time yes the opposition lost those battles in trying to remove schottische Chavez consolidated his power and excluded them\nTo carry it out and it became more and more authoritarian said that they fight very well a democratically through elections by the time you get up to the present day\nGo shop is of course has since died things have gotten no better in fact probably worse under his yes successor Nicolas Maduro but let's step back and then when you're talking about polarization the way you seem to describe it it's not just political extends to society in general\nYes exactly and that's when it becomes more and more difficult to result you know one way to define polarization is just differences and they growing distance\nDefined polarization is just differences and the growing distance in political leaders political parties\nBeliefs and attitudes on specific issues if it's just that it's possible you know to look for compromise that isn't to negotiate or for people to choose okay we're going to like this party now and go in this direction and uh we don't like that next time around will elect a different party going to different direction when it gets\nTo this more emotional level what we call ... festive polarization because it involves feelings an aspect\nThat's when we get into tribalism and we dislike and we just stressed and were suspicious of the other team the other side the other party and oldest supporters of that other party or that candidate\nThere was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nTo no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they didn't they were front page news they were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's nothing in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizers\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fight to expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde when Alice Alice ... went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compound\nYou spoke just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story or something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story I'm a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused and even obsessed serve it and who stands up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference so I Hope it works on all those levels\n... new book is called the poison squad one kind of a single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth
