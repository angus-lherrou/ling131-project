N. F. or the intermediate range nuclear forces agreement then President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the treaty in Nineteen eighty seven\nAdvance all short and medium range nuclear

defense secretary James Mattis has described Russian breach of the agreement as untenable\nKingston reef the director for disarmament research at the arms control association an advocacy group says the Trump administration's withdraw from the treaty will allow Russia to continue the deployment of that type of missile and revive Cold War tensions\nAll constraints on the production of feeling that missile have gone away thereby increasing the threat to our allies particularly in Europe in range of those missiles\nMilitary competition with China was another reason for the U.S withdraw China was never a signatory to the Nineteen eighty seven treaty which means that can develop medium range missiles without constraint\nHunch Christensen is the director of the nuclear information project at the federation of American scientists which promotes international transparency and nuclear disarmament\nChina has undertaken abroad modernization of its military forces and as part of the modernization

afternoon I'm Sandy all house thanks for listening to cake kiwi DSM San Francisco it's five twenty\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin we're going to return to a difficult and for some people a traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse are finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth flash ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this or this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never so I I don't even know why I went\nI I didn't know anybody to all of a sudden a kid came upstairs that hey go outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us one out there and I happened to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa\nShe looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off and then he he he took her panties off and then he he pulled on his than any one on top of it\nOn the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou you know you wrote about why you think that the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and\nShame they would have been told it's your fault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nAh [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in in the article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men\nTalk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a\nQuote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder\nInstead of admitting you committed a sexual assault and uh I I Can't answer I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of me too movement I think we should come forward in a talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her\nJust the rape part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that to this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to pay let me tell you but everything's okay now evidence and how did you explain that to your boys well\nJust I was truthful\nWith them and uh they were very receptive\nOn their dad you know dad can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our kids are\nThey both told me that my two older boys they don't think would happen now they said everybody at that window would have had their phones al\nVideotaping it that's what they told\nBut that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but in that sense that kid wouldn't have done it 'cause he wouldn't have wanted to be on film\nYou know we film everything you know what they would kind of a moving to\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your chest you know [laughter]\nAnd I have mixed feelings I'll be honest here or there are days when I regret it and then there are days that I'm Glad I did you know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people\nSome women have said it's about time someone it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit that a lot of women ah said\nAh\nThey were glad I did it and they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a\nSalted\nWho wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if I were to help these women then but I didn't do it Don ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend shriek Adams\n[laughter]\nCareer was acquitted of first degree murder and that supported the death penalty but he was convicted of planning the murder carried out by a hit man she was able to deliver the child named chancellor but she died weeks later\nCurve Ruth was sentenced to more than two dozen years in prison but with time served he's scheduled to be

much for having me on the show really appreciate it now it's my understanding is that you you never talked with him after the murder\nBut he authorized his attorney to speak with you it's my understanding from your reporting that to this day he's still denies that he was planning a murder he says it was a drug deal gone wrong in essence he says that he was a coward not a killer that he thought that ran Brett Watkins is trying to kill him\nAnd he left the scene but that he didn't do anything about is that about right\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro at Silicon

the world more at ... dot org and that listeners who support this NPR station\nThis is the democracy test Trump truth politics and power I'm you'll come\nAnd I'm headed Cox Richardson elections are the central mechanism of democracy in theory it works because the people decide on candidates ballot issues and so on its elections give governments their mandates and their legitimacy\nWorked there is an important distinction here\nThe way it actually works out it's not the people who decide to voters and those can be two very different groups\nOf establishment of the republic voters included only white male landowners obviously the right to vote the franchise has expanded considerably over the years but the history of American politics is a story of ... in franchise meant as well systematic and deliberate exclusions that continue to the present day\nCarolyn Anderson is a professor of African American studies at Emory University her books include white rage\nAnd most recently one person no vote how voters depression destroying our democracy she joined us from a conference room there at Emory\nWelcome to the democracy test Carol Oh thank you so much for having me have a history in a minute but you describe for women I remember the whole problem of making sure that you're official name match the name under which you voted in of course only women whose name tend to change when they're adults I've always thought that was fascinating example\nIt was just like being down at the um Georgia version of the bureau of motor vehicles and watching women come in with all of these documents only to be turned away because of the documents aren't lining up with who they say they are and what makes this so infuriating is that all of this mess about voter id\nIs predicated on a lie the lie of voter fraud the lie of massive rampant voter fraud and that lie has consistently been targeted at the city's saying that in the cities\nWe have people who are impersonating other people and voting multiple times they're voting from using vacant lots as addresses their you know coming under dead people's names and voting and\nYou tell a lie enough times that it begins to sound like the truth and that's where we are right now so predicated on the lie of voter fraud\nThen we're able to create this almost like rockstar fire that democracy is in peril and only these mechanisms will save democracy but those mechanisms like voter id in fact\nDamage destroy the voting rights of American citizens\nWe said earlier that at the beginning of the republic voting rights are only extended to white real landowners and you know we like to think that there's a story of a steadily expanding franchise is that right\nNot quite [laughter] um [laughter] you you know histories about changing continuity and going back and having to redo it all over again so we get this movement um an\nEighteen sixty seven the franchise has expanded to black men\nAnd trying to pull all of that documentation together\nIs difficult in Indiana\nAnd one of their voter id law suits a woman came forward who talked about how many times she had to go to the department of vehicles and never had the appropriate number or types of identification to be able to get the driver's license so that she could vote and you know that's\nA really important distinction between the idea that women are going to be radicals and therefore shouldn't have a vote versus the idea that women are going to vote like their husbands and therefore should have the vote\nAnd it's interesting to me that the suffrage movement in the early twentieth century women were very careful to dress in white and to push their babies in their suffrage parades and to talk about how they were good American citizens and they were supporting their husbands and that's\nThe era in which they get the vote and in fact women\nDo tend to vote like their husbands until the gender gap begins in Nineteen eighty that's when we get the beginning of the gender gap\nAnd it's growing ever since until it is now at the largest it's ever been in American history which is I think one of the reasons that people are don't quite know what to do with the day's politics because women are not behaving the way they have in the past and no one quite knows what's going to happen with that\nYou mean this women behaving badly thing and where women there are certainly saying yes [laughter] right you know that this kind of thing going you know what we should get equal pay for equal work what we should have control of our bodies\nUm we should have the kinds of protections that when our our rights in our bodies are violated\nThat the system works as well for us as it does for those who are doing the violating equality before the law [laughter] oh my gosh [laughter] and ... and ... and we're absolutely seeing that right now frankly I'm with this Kavanaugh debacle\nYou've talked about a lot of different things that go into voter suppression what worries you the most what's the most important\nIt all ties together I think the one that I find the most pernicious because it's the most hidden\nIs gerrymandering um earlier you had talked about the redrawing of these districts and\nOf course the redrawing of the districts is constitutionally mandated and it's supposed to be done by a legislative body after the the sensors to take into account the population shifts and so that we get the kinds of a portion meant\nFor the number of representatives that each state should have in the U.S Congress except the way that it's been done and I mean we started out I mean Patrick Henry gerrymandered to try to to keep James Madison out of the U.S Congress and so\nWe've got a long nap me history of of gerrymandering but what has happened\nSince then after the twenty ten election it took on a kind of ... it's it's like on anabolic steroids or something I'll talk about Wisconsin and because it's representative of what's going on\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite super like grow up there looking valley base manufacturer of energy efficient data better hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nOr what happens with non competitive districts are people feel like the gain is rigged it doesn't matter if I'd vote or not vote to because they're going to win anyway and so people stay home they're demoralized\nVast whatnot competitive districts do they drive I'm a depression and voter turnout\nThe second goal for the Republicans want to say that regardless of how many votes they received\nThey would always get the majority of seats in the state legislature now I Know that that sounds backwards for the way that a democracy works regardless of how many votes we will always get the majority the maps that they drew\nThey were powerful maps to the point where no Democrats were allowed in the process at all\nAnd the Republicans who weren't in that room we're only allowed to see their district but they had to sign a nondisclosure agreement in order to see that district and the twenty twelve election using these newly drawn maps Democrats received fifty two percent of the vote\nAnd gained thirty nine percent\nOf the seats in the state legislature\nAnd to be fair or Republicans would argue that Democrats did pretty much the same thing in a state like Maryland it's just there's Republicans control more states than Democrats due to the point\nWhere I think looking to the twenty Eighteen mid term elections projections are that if Democrats hope to win control of the house of representatives or after when something like fifty six fifty seven percent of the vote\nExactly that kind of imbalance does violence to the constitutional concept of one person one vote\nAnd where it also does violence is that because of the ways these districts have been drawn like in Pennsylvania where Republicans receive forty nine percent of the vote but Seventy two percent\nOf the congressional seats is that it has put somewhere between sixteen to twenty six additional GOP seats in Congress\nAnd it's created these kind of rotten boroughs where politicians are able to choose their electorate instead of the electorate choosing them and so they are immune in some ways from the will of the voters\nAnd you talked about dispiriting voters who don't bother to turn out these various things if you go to register to vote and time and time again you turned away 'cause you don't have the right documentation and all these different mechanisms they act to corrode democracy to destroy people's faith in what's going on\nYes exactly I'll take Ohio for instance\nUm in early voting was put in place to try to expand access to the voter booth\nBecause having elections on a Tuesday in November that's generally a work day for a lot of folks and so being able to to get to vote and then get to work when you've got a punch the clock is very difficult\nSo early voting provides access to people particularly working class people\nTo be able to fully participate in American democracy what Ohio did on the surface it looks equitable Ohio said we will have one early voting site for each county wow each county gets one except the counties are very different\nAh Cuyahoga County loose right Cuyahoga River in Cleveland or county right exactly a has one point two five million people that's a big county\nWhat happens then is that you have a line for hours long lines in these big county's like Franklin County with Columbia Columbus and Hamilton County uh with Cincinnati\nAnd people are able to just fly through in these smaller counties what they did in North Carolina for instance and Mecklenburg county where Charlotte is\nAnd Charlotte has about seven hundred and fifty thousand people and Fifteen Percent of the states ... black population lives there\nThey reduced the number of early polling sites from twenty two to four twenty two [laughter]\nSo before and the Republicans say they sent out a little note congratulating themselves because by strangling early voting sites this way there were like wow in the twenties sixteen or election in early voting there were like\nAfrican American early voter turnout is down by eight point five percent yes I mean how do you congratulate yourself for denying American citizens the right to vote\nCarolyn Anderson thank you very much\nThank you Neal thank you so much\nCarolyn Anderson of Emory University her new book is one person no vote how voter

Detrow NPR News [noise]\n\nAnd you portray going on to Christie's auction block Thursday maybe reminiscent of a Rembrandt but it's actually the work of artificial intelligence\nIs called a portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars\nComputer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you pleasure to be here I'll say how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel do shop\nWhere he literally took 'em then you're in on it on a wall right and this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand that things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's ads her that the market ability or a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they want him to price that in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is all are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at why people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is if the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe\nIs ... between the programming the quarter is the collective and maybe even a little bit of a ... for helping to create the frenzy around and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around as if this painting were created by human ... think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off\nAnd so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare era appraisals just
