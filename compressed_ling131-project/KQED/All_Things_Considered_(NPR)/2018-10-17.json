states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think guy frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of that's moving forward\nAmelia I understand

actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individual could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou have the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that it got you know some wonderful fellow than interns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you ... and you know I I was like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way of says he ... four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age and tell you I'm [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age yeah\nThis is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but\nWhen you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law

the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman and especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae beauty keep candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you or you won't believe that I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact or having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are falling behind us\nI Want

Middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Christian or a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared

today with Christian or on the ...\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment Kushner was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter could show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of course there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks the experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that cushion or could act as a back channel\nTo Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear as some of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports are that\nKushner a Christian or a

Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me\nWhy do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and allusions diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have race in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering when at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it racist sort of something that is becoming not just nearly factor but often times the factory that decision is based on\nI think heart rate is saying that they don't do that but let's interfaith missions has been showing in the past few days and it has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents on missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of get this with Jewish applicants as well\nAnd sort of use of personal rating to artificially keeps saying I'm very slowly although they were going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case have alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost at the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of that argument\nI didn't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these varies I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from the inner city public high school background and I do recognize that Mary guys need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at night in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone who's opportunities or resources are really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll that sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits of it are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions and instead focus on something like poverty\nBecause when we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think
