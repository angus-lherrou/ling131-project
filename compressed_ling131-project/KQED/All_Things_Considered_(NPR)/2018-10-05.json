Brownsville a lot of it is exactly what you'd expect black kids raised in the area thirty some years ago now make about Seventeen thousand dollars a year same as their parents\nBut once you head across Dumont avenue everything changes\nBlack kids from the same exact background are doing better than their parents making around twenty six thousand dollars a year to find out what happened on the other side of Dumont avenue people pulled me to go to church\n\nReverend\nDavid Cay Brawley is one of the leaders of east Brooklyn congregations in\nHis office he tells me that in the early Nineteen eighties Brownsville New York was often referred to as\nThe beginning and the civilization burned out homes empty lot people were leaving the city and grow\nIn the eighties New York city had been hard hit by a recession then the crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of ... that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city government sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the men in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem\nThe family was growing and we needed

state of North Dakota\nRight that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if God Kavanaugh gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks and watching\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants to Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I\nAsked ... to ... did he offered this information to the FBI or yes I did um\nChad letting ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and then tailed sending a request for form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact the former run that had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces of bailout\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I read by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email of nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all the ones who lived in front of the so usually a committee or what is taken an oath and what is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic line was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black and you know I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the black man freeze means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about make new three maybe four to eighty five that you know college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job and that sense at all\nChat letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created that healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the ... that's just a share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into the open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector suited accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional and business services those are like high end services things like designed accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent why aren't wages going faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nKnow when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power\nSponsorship of the cake you read

with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all\nOf view seven Russian officers are in Russia and there is no us extradition treaty in place so\nWhy bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries\nWhere there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen that the OJ says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers America knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the

with Brett Kavanaugh Democrat said that the White House was withholding key documents thousands of different documents\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat does rock vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRocks paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nTo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming up through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer and looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that owns the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves [noise] was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal debates a amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your\nResearch there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed [noise]\nI certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where\nWe can prove whether or not the men actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its\nCreation you're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI Want to just steady planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets
