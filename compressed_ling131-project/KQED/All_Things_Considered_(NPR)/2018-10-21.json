K. cue weedy\nGood afternoon and the time now and five twenty\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin in recent years the public has gotten more and more concerned about the deaths of citizens particularly unarmed citizens during police encounters\nIn a few minutes we're going to hear from a Texas lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy on October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office she NATO Coby was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him\nAccording to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several times this Kobe later died at a hospital and it might have ended there was out much public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella Kobe\nIs Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story and she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for\nYour loss thank you so much for having me now I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black man um I think it it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed him and I think a classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet they're officers managed to to arrest him without harming him it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from black men in particular versus Iraq for white men that very clear racial disparity\nBetween ... you know to do that he has been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds that sort of those those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to yeah I bet if someone you wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not ever sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof\nThose things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall during his you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as there is so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate\nYes that's absolutely accurate\nDo you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police are they are often disproportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of interest actually nowadays he is at the intersection as being a person's color black man and the intersection as having a mental health disability and I think the ... and I think I Know specific show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person they're black men so I definitely think mental health has something to do this and I think there's a huge question about what policies shouldn't be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who has committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege empowered intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be both that aren't as connected on the issue of poverty that aren't as connected as she does not have health in certain areas and connected it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I hadn't been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that then I had the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result as colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who I'm saddened by the responses and story that we needed to be told that's\nAbout ... uh Kobe she ... she naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being taste by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us in our sympathies for your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course apple assigned this is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just on into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nRead you know my family [noise]\nWhy are you\nKnow obviously had all the\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over a position of African Americans and Latinos ... it up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement door traffic stops I guess ... is kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up as steel he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nJust and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to fire the baby right traditions citizens and police officers ship which last year\nIs that people are getting the legislation shift focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on the video camera such huge for additional core Scott tip for both citizen and also pollution pollution ...\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to fire the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the\nLeft of course is a minimum of two hours the video was just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to fix to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nLegislators the purpose of the video is as a primer your when you go back and Richard\nRichard up a try we can do it but the purpose is to make certain we defied behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the ... you\nKnow what their rights are when you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and ticket was cast in your your tried I Can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that use it sparked your concern here is an African American man and I can and account or with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you were\nTo ask questions you can pick out and that's fine because they do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to have a mechanism\nBut the objective was the front of a mechanism by which we should establish behavior content\nFor everyone and I started getting a driver's license is a perfect place to put to a

G. and the listeners have cake key weedy can afternoon and the time now it's five forty one\n[noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe want to turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal court as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society is role and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that keeps tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and find something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now I don't think so much for joining us demeanor so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for in a bit of quote now from their materials\nFor any purpose contrary to their mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that if it like the the ethical concern here is what you did get to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges and not to a private organization that describes itself\nAs a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nYeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks than others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nAll kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipelines for half of the purpose I think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they've been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system\nAnd to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine\nBut also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is\nNot five and what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey had been very close mouthed about it a try them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment of each and every attendee\nThey wouldn't say who the donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief blessed\nSince of families who are dealing with this every day cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular Ninety show after it start Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the counters which mere this week and we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about it so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks so much for joining us\nPleasure to be here myself I guess also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online chef welcome back to you as well\nAlways welcome to be back here and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough social commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you say\nYou know it's really interesting because any time a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black and dark and\nA looming in a lot of ways in our society there is a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide be inside right and in the case one of the things that was really strange to me is that\nOne of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweets that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there is a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the real world or\nCulture guy though when did you think of the episode just as briefly\nAs yeah I Know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the absence of resembles was powerful [laughter] so uh I I thought they did a pretty good job
