sharing ... infant Michel Martin\nWe're going to start the program in Florida where relief efforts are underway in areas hit by hurricane Michael access to food water and other supplies is still a challenge NPR's Joel Rose has been reporting for the last couple of days Joel what have you seen\nI've seen long lines for gas for food for water um for all sorts of basic supplies are as people are trying to come back into their homes and and clean up after the storm\nBut you know long lines is an improvement because earlier in the week you couldn't find any of those things in Panama City or any of the surrounding suburbs\nUm so you know where we are seeing an emergency response really start to step up and get these things out to people but it's you know it remains a challenge to find some to get supplies into some of the harder hit areas\nI'm In the suburbs to the east of Panama City and also up into rural inland communities that were hit really hard by the storm um that are a little more difficult to reach so uh you know the emergency response is getting underway but I'm sure it's going to be awhile before it reaches everybody who's affected\nAnd communication is still really tap in places where phone service is down the Internet's down how has that affected rescue efforts\nI think it has been a real problem I mean cell phone service those non existent for days after the storm and it's still really spotty I'm In Panama City in the surrounding county\nAnd it it's difficult because people can't coordinate the emergency response it's hard to\nTell people where to go if you can't communicate with them and it it's also making it really difficult for people to call their family members and check in and say hey you know I'm OK I'm here you know I Need this or that kind of supply or even just I'm Alive you know I mean emergency crews are going door to door to try to\nYou know figure out who survive the storm and who didn't and and I have to think it would be a lot\nIt it must be slowing this effort down for them not to be able to communicate with people by cell phone or anywhere almost anywhere in Bay county so it's um [noise] I think it's been a real hindrance to the relief effort\nAnd some areas in the state do you have power back but there are a lot of places that still don't have power you have any idea when that's going to change\nWhen we got some new

against Asian an Asian American applicants and here to tell us more is carry young she's a reporter with member station WNPR in Boston hey Carey high at first what are the arguments being made in the case\nWell students for fair admissions their group that filed this lawsuit will be trying to prove essentially for things in this case first they say that Harvard illegally uses a quota system or racial balancing in admissions\nThey say the admissions rates for each demographic group or or two similar from year to year a second the group is arguing that Harvard admissions is considering race too much or that it's a deciding factor and not just a factor of a factor like affirmative action policy actually allows\nThe group also thinks that Harvard hasn't adequately explored admissions methods that don't use race they say that you really can still get a diverse class by considering things like geography and socioeconomic status\nBut as you mentioned the biggest delegation here is that Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of statistical analysis actually but it basically boils down to an argument where\nThey'll try to show that while Asian American applicants do have the highest academic qualifications or\nGPA standardized test scores things like that that they consistently or in the lower personal scores from the admissions department and a a personal score is a number of the Harvard assigns applicants to to write things like personal essays\nLetters of recommendation and even the amount of personal hardship that someone face but\nThe person behind this lawsuit is an Asian American ... his name is Edward Blum can you tell us more about him\nThat is

children's lives will be better than our own\nThere's always been a gap between rich and poor now intention between a broadly based democracy and the power of wealthy elites today that gap as big as it's ever been and it's helped corrode faith in our basic institutions and belief in democratic solutions\nBut we've been here before in the Eighteen nineties the progressive ... at a rose to challenge the power of the trust some the robber barons and in the Nineteen thirties amidst the despair of the great depression the new deal transformed the role of government and restored faith and democracy\nLater in the program we'll talk with political historian Lawrence Jacobs from the University of Minnesota about how and why inequality expanded late twentieth century and how that eats away

everything to fear you set the date march worth Nineteen thirty three quote\nThe weeks leading up to Franklin Roosevelt induction into the White House we're a nightmare as an unprecedented economic collapse it quieted the cheerleading about America's future that\nBusiness leaders and the press and politicians have made a hallmark of the Nineteen twenties optimism was in short supply voices of despair crowded out the promise of American Life\nIn January Ninety thirty three Calvin Coolidge the retired Republican president said in other periods of depression it has always been possible to see some things that were solid and upon which you could base hope but as I look about I now see nothing to give ground for hope nothing of man\nYou go on Herbert Hoover on his last day as president says we're in a pitiful position we are at the end of our strength and Robert Dallek is it fair to say that many were ready to pronounce American democracy a failure\nOr they were and in fact what you have to remember all of us have to remember is that this was a time when fascism in Italy\nNot Susan in Germany and communism and Russia were competing for those Kennedy later put his hearts and minds but it was the feeling that mock because she had reached its at\nThe end of the line and that these other ideologies these although it's just them she government oh one more appealing and of course that was the challenge for Franklin Roosevelt to address could he recreate faith than hope in\nA democratic institutions\nDemocracy is a great experiment appear to have run aground on the rocks right at the time that fascism in communism seemed to some to be a vibrant and robots especially by comparison to the ruins of the American economy exactly FDR promised a new deal for the American people have specific coherent alternatives to propose\nWell it was not just the new deal but he says\nWhen he came to the Democratic convention in Nineteen thirty two we must be profits but new order suggesting that there were going to be reforms about changes in the way in which the institutions of the country had function in the past and particularly in the recent past\nBoth houses but at off first setbacks and the fighting or lose that consensus and he saw that as him permissible and so that was an act of great political shrewd in his on his part because of course in that sense Pearl Harbor was\nA godsend to unite the country and bring it into the war as a a a a solid failings of a support\nWell that that begs the question now how did he hold on to popular support when his critics on the right we're calling him a dictator and a communist and of course the policy to exceed after some recovery early on FDR cut back on spending and there was another found slumped in the economy I didn't really not managed to keep Americans behind them\nWell in fact if they had not in World War two if the warhead not broken out Nineteen thirty nine I don't think Roosevelt would have\nBeen able to win a third term\nBecause in his second term when as you just described the country\nHad that recession and the Roosevelt Nineteen thirty eight\nTry to defeat conservatives and the Democratic party in the primary elections specially across the south and he fell short and\nAll but one instance in fighting the conservatives in this party and I don't think he ever could have gotten the nomination again and certainly not a window search term\nSo it was a war that really in a sense gave him a second opportunity and the country rallied around him and of course the fact that we ended up winning the war brings him down to rush through\nHistory as one of the three great presidents of American history\nYou said earlier that Roosevelt did and and the depression relieved that in fact the war mobilization ended the effort at your biography does not shy away from Franklin Roosevelt mistakes or from his failure to take in Jewish refugees are from his failure to address racial issues more forcefully\nHis decision to turn Japanese Americans in the second World War given all of that and more you still argue that his legacy is one of greatness\nWell it is because he was a brilliant leader in that he used radio to reach\nPeople in the grassroots so to speak and\nTo rush through history as one of the three great presidents of American history\nYou said earlier that Roosevelt and and the depression relieved that in fact the war mobilization\nAnd did the effort at your biography does not shy away from Franklin Roosevelt mistakes or from his failure to take in Jewish refugees from his failure to address racial issues more forcefully\nHis decision to turn Japanese Americans in the second World War given all of that and more you still argue that his legacy is one of greatness\nWell it is because he was a brilliant leader in that he used radio to reach people in the grassroots so to speak\nAnd if you look at the polling data\nThroughout his presidency at least in the Gallup polls he'd never went below fifty percent and see what a contrast that is to the current incumbent which never achieved fifty percent in his going on two years in the White House see\nNow is speaks to Rochelle ... ... as a politician and\nYes there were stumbles there was shortcomings they were limitations but again he reflected the public mood in the country when you know he didn't press the case energetically to rescue Jewish knowledge cost\nHe was reflecting the mood in the country\nWhich was very much anti immigration there was a lot of feeling that at the end of the war the country was going to get back into a recession or depression and that bringing in lots of immigrants would add to the unemployment role and so Roosevelt was\nVery lucky to challenge that outlook that sentiment you see\nAnd also as leaders Nineteen forty four people in the country we were asked if they believed that the Nazis were systematically\nKilling Jews in concentration camps and something like sixty percent of the poll said they didn't believe that they thought it was one time propaganda from the British which had joined us into World War one and so they were very skeptical look that\nI'm going to go back to something you said before and use it to look forward you are listening to the fact that FDR might well nine of one third term\nAnd it was really World War two they pushed us into the creation of the liberal state the New York state yes are you saying that we might not have had that state if it had not been for World War two\nWell it is certainly a loud Roosevelt preserve it but I think that there were things that he had already put in place like Social Security you'll see\nAn approval in Nineteen thirty five ... through the Wagner Act for a labor unions\nLegitimizing them\nAnd I don't think those would have disappeared because you see once you get things like Social Security and more recently Medicare or look how difficult it's been to overturn a the Affordable CARE Act that the President Obama\nPut in place to see\nWell here's the next question then behind that why did change how American society how American democracy different in Nineteen forty five and it had been in Nineteen thirty to write an FDR diner how would American Made such a profound change\nIt was it was a permanent change that this sort of notion that you were going to have some kind of ... involvement of the federal government in the national economy in a providing a bedrock of support\nFor people who are less fortunate than the ... in society\nThat these had become accepted propositions of the society\nAnd that they're not going to be repealed you know Social Security and Medicare I don't think they're ever going to go away as long as we have a democracy and the Democratic voting with a small D in this country\nBecause these are institutions that strike resident call ins with people\nYou see the new deal human lives the American industrial system\nAnd lots of things that Lyndon Johnson did added to that and the Affordable CARE Act Obama\nAdded to that and so people don't want that to go away yes there is a certain conservative impulse in the country and they still have faith in a a self help in the notion of the\nPeople increasing their prosperity and having a better life that they had children these are still central propositions I think I'm American society and of the American east coast\nSo I don't think this material will go away it was very much a change in the twentieth century than industrialized society\nCould not continue to
