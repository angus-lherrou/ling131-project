system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like when you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of lack list\nStacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast bring us this story about life on China's list of ... trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in shank she'd province in China in one day he went online to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing\nYou put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up saying he could not complete the purchase\nOf underground yeah and they said that this person is on the unprecedented list from the cart\nLoud one was confused why couldn't keep up the street to get you started looking into the situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loved one has landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nJulian but one thing that comes along with the black lists the unpleasant resident live on that\nUh you're fired from\nHigh end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started to block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business she would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapse\nSuddenly all the whole loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back\nAnd the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his accounts in credit card had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face just like up on a big billboard\nOr not like you're more than be electric ...\nBy the side of the ... plaza there are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can't really see them from afar visit and I saw my my patriots and that's why it's like a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is untrustworthy ... says these billboards are all over town\nShe says

one and a half million dollars to the originally owed so still about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard\nWe talked to ... and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt well it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen\nWe reached out to
