Mike Pompeo oh who would work to secure\nFor instance release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom\nWill what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\n... uh he had been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department\nAnd especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case um Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen at that wasn't enough President Trump

been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performance art he's not doing this to be provocative he's not doing this to sell albums\nIt's very clear at least to me that this is how he feels um he even said that racism was in a deal breaker for him and\nAs a former ... fan myself that's really sad coming from

to the program thank you for having me and us [laughter] we're out here [laughter] I Know you don't\nWant to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a pimp there a couple of pimp types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women with a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never well I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different\nConversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst in value are determined by my parents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself\nBeing really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have big smiles on this side and\nYou know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as ... as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nAnd there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you embody whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods and goddesses in trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic is half what do we can help them and again all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I\nHave a direct connection to them and the public myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character you know I can remember Hi Dan my name is probably more so individual ... went to United Nation schools\nYou also comes from a mixed culture background so she was growing up with different people from different places\nFrom for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of walking off some of this ...\n... the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said but it goes cracking good job or she is a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit\nSo you know I really try to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this

up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interface guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me\nAnd to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is that you talk white you this do that now I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm
