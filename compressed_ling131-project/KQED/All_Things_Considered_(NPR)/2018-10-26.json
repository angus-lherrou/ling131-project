Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington the attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nI can say with certainty that we will identify interested Persian or people responsible for these actions\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts of seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned an actor and prominent Trump credit Robert De Niro had received one of the package at an address linked to him in New York\nAnother common denominator is that these are people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a ever had the potential to explode and ... are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI assistant director William Sweeney says the powder and at least some of these aren't elopes does not\nAppear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of\nAlcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work there is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen\nSeemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to exploded the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them and did that was that happening\nFor political or personal reason all of that is a big focus this investigation or two if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New

with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was probably because we built a reward illegal immigration we really need to have is a legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as their so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\nBut I I'm nobody's called a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children in Australia and it's set of eyes by laws we pass by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interests of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator or unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de ... countries with southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before SRAs special interests aliens when was the network that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than that and other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that no truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the harder it is a pollster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nWould not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so\nDisagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual acts of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in the Atlanta to I've had I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad\nBut it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect checkup a second claim with you a President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it it's a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change laws so we can use incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask\nYou the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurring Honduras or people opposed to a prison than just down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of our products from a whole bunch purity most of these\nLaws are under my major's diction we've gotta do to my Comey's juice diction because that was a move forward and and working with my colleagues that their agree with that I can start handling this so I tried to go through this as a business person would\nBe a problem solver gather the information ... agreement in our community we you know we all agree one of the board\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want to force their laws and then we don't separate families so try to go through the problem solving process\nVery transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and that may be successful breeds success\n[noise] senator thanks so much for your time every day it's Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north

the migrants to score political points back home he denies all those claims\nSubtle fatter or he's at me for a local river than they used to work with the benefit of that or is it yeah\nYou just have

that possibly any of these\nYou know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intent there they're focusing in the investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre

himself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refuse to defenders well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly essays criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw well\nI think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News

impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a

was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween now I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round here really um we do every year in quotes which in fact we joke\nThat October is likely is I've been an advocate Halloween is Christmas at all companies and this one day of the year when all the ... costuming comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history of this when did we first started paying blackface and America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people are talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people as lazy as animal is to play on caricature said the caricatures of course in that sits next to obviously this broad the humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black face [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow fever portrayals of Asian American the rate of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against that\nAnd to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured were often not in a position to push back showing some is orange point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and this shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo Turkish back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said\nShe didn't know about this history [noise] what do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance is not a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white paint over to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of broader context we always start in a store or vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the concepts of things change depending on who delivering something who's receiving\nThe context of things change depending on who you're delivering something who's receiving it so many controversies tend to happen if you read when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person independence and no one at that party me about an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different Los ... to the consequences of imagery as well maybe these into conversation will be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on A People's souls or whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about

actor Robert Deniro into in Delaware for former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd make the total of ten packages sent this week to prominent critics of President Trump along with CNN [noise]\nThe big question of course it's who sent them the head of the FBI is New York office William Sweeney gave an update on the investigation to reporters today\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nNPR's Hansi Lo Wang has been reporting on the investigation from New York City and hunting where does the investigation stand at this point into these packages\nOr you have a really a full force of law enforcement trying to figure out why this happened who was behind this uh this includes the FBI they might pd also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages\nThey're found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling\nAnd law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here and try to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York office\nOr the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological threat other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such when she'll proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices\nOr else batted away any questions that possibly any of these you know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intent they're focusing in the investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nBut one big question is where these packages sent through the whole system or some of them could they have been delivered by carrier and also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures\nThat may be able to identify who who's the individual or individuals' behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved\nAnd you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that you know postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York\nWill the baggage is in New York as we mentioned earlier which were sent to vice president former vice president Joe Biden Newcastle county Delaware and there was one baggage that was sent to the business office of Robert De Niro

and go what's going on people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on BlackBerrys\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently\nProminent talk show host from understanding this history and it's called the ones who\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team thank you\nThank you so much Louisiana over [laughter] I Hope not [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\nFrom kick you any News I'm Tiffany cam high\nFour years ago this month one of Google's high level executives left the company\nThreatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the U. S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern trying all nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs from Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our border so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is the the us has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would\nYou tell them that you know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable\nIn Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments\nTo protect their people\n... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out this ancient part of the brain it may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismissed it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico do some boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion of eighty percent of dedicated to higher order of cognitive functions what\nKind of did it functions Scott America postdoc in doesn't box lab offers some examples\nThinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and its\nIt's important for all of his day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effort less\nAmerica Says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but doesn't bug says the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nWe're already thought that the cerebellum is cruel that most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's the way scientists to neurologist had been missing in front of the time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when did impairs the cerebellum\nYou have an explanation father bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking started rather editing are your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results his Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of certain but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are low income mission means that say about them is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it's smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task what\nWe now understand is that the cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder\nThere is increasing evidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder all have a link to cerebellum\nAnd Sherman says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm Judy Woodruff on the next thing is our our whole films Harry continues with
