Esther Mobley and Esther you're an expert on why and what exactly are smoke tainted grapes and how do they affect the wine\nUnfortunately smoke pain is pretty poorly understood that what we do know is that when a wildfire smoke lingers for a certain period of time certain compounds smoke can penetrate great scans\nIf a wine is processed and obtain appears it tastes really bad you think oh you know

[noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the United States Supreme court\nThis afternoon the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on a fifty two forty eight vote one of the closest margins ever\nKevin has been sworn in by chief justice Roberts in a private ceremony NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill Scott welcome thanks so much for joining us show the first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides so ads that was happening person after person in the gallery interrupted with visceral personal protests strip mansion\n[noise]\nCircles has been [noise]\nCharging it arms will restore order and the gallery so that's\nThat's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story and one scene descendants struggling with its formal responsibilities made hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThat has all been so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii says this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat's what I I'm left with Mr President anger Harry this guy\nAnd a process that could not see the truth of what Dr for I Try to tell us\nAnd Republicans feel like this has been character assassination from day one here's John Cornyn\nI Am disappointed more than I can say those who have been leashed these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family\nAnd\nDisappointed and their lack of any empathy or more as for what they have put them through\nWell let let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and it's got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument off in in in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing that Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nThey said they believed that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her\nOr that they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday ensuring Kavanaugh would be appointed a confirmed to the court that there were no corroborating accounts more questions the not\nSo and the and we have the same result as Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill testified about Clarence Thomas a woman comes forward with allegations and the man she accused ends up on the Supreme Court well let's talk about sort of more broadly for the minute or so that\n...\nSupport for NPR comes from log men

... is sitting in for Sandy outhouse we do have a red flag warning in effect\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told the Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago\nWhen I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move the country in a better direction\nAnd women across the country across the world for that matter a have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now which makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision could make an informed\nDecision with all the facts that happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford bunnies Ramirez and by others\nWho would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this was having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats or showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what his doctor for think about that [noise]\nI think what she has done is in credibly important and that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it\nCommitted and this is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact in November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passion and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting in November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefit\nWe just have to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thought\nMy name is Emily fires I'm forty three years old\nI work at Jefferson ville Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film it center since it opened up about six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her out roughly sixteen\nAnd I have a son who does travel ball and for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now and the way the two years for my stocks to us\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at the ... center on the west coast\nAnd I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen\nSeventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five an hour oh let's concerning us mainly is\nWere given a monthly bonus\nAnd when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles\nAnd we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\nMy name's Folsom Martinez had been working on for weeks worst in the ... century Miami start working in the store surprises in the company that you received emerged from those [noise] I mean through burger immigrants were\nAs farmers in there and do this for hours on the country are you going to be reducing hours after November first\nVery excited about it because the wider use them for a better quality for cash for which I was with her because I don't have to be here for sure go full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work which Amazon employees are effective\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their exist being fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with um you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses so particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does a company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money would this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were before\nSo I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase in the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees to know that it was coming\nAny idea why why why do they now so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that this conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activity that some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number the median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for family of four\nNow that is a worldwide number is what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history

Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dash cam video sparked large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life or connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nRefer to fight [laughter] guilty of that history [noise] [laughter] [laughter]\nWB\nEasiest Gen Y is host of the pie catch sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also the sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting ... McDonald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer midnight\nWe heard from the head of the F O P than fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWhat would you say some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course comes when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and his children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist\nThe defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nUh the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of report it on the fact that this opens up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigate it CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look\nAt the police department as a whole you know what is reform look like you know what is it going to look like moving forward\nIs this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but isn't going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different\nPanels form to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's going to happen from here\nThat ... she's the host of sixteen shots at a pot catchment WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van
