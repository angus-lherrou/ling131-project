Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint that changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember when I was like I don't remember how many years ago when I don't know [noise] and today in the White House\nBriefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nI vote or just the motives version though it was like the first woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seem to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key were incredible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really diverting from that line and he was doing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today\nSome how the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nIn one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise lasted shared\nAnd you know he was really he really seemed to be saying she's on attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nOctober fourteenth in downtown San Francisco

and I'm Ari Shapiro many people in the U.S auto industry are breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will finish senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies and make auto parts here in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well entered after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we're very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic for terms in the green that will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries can act to call it the U.S Mexico\nCanada agreement that traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum are so all of that would impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have cell or are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states addressed apple for the finalized disagreement and the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada the U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to mind is that the next ... burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members just seen the cost it they're still purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is ... increase it typically is concerned between cat and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up the ... same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on stay on the woman I'm ...\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare it to\nThe auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA is it an improvement is worse well\nI think for the United states perspective when the things in the United states said little pool through was there an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral woman that from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have is the administrators cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because the consumers are going to get any value out of fat and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we look for that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the motor on equipment

the public fears to rest then amid news of the cancer cluster and twenty six teen workers made an alarming discovery high levels of pee fast chemicals and surface waters around the landfill since then

were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the ... inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose Hey Joe hey also yeah we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families like what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures didn't Nielsen\nFishing for anything that that these niners they're very well taken care I don't believe that they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da chest held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages in border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and it's just in after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nIs no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keys\nI Would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nHGH asked by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time the H. S. said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database to the inspector general signed that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to their families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children it anyway no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chess does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer systems still do not communicate across these agencies\n... are there any children still hadn't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much junk you're walking [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMontana has become a popular campaign stop for President Trump and vice president Pence so popular that each of them has been there twice in recent months that's because Republicans are trying to unseat two term democratic Senator Jon tester\nDuring Pence's second visit there yesterday he fired up a rally talking about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court Montana Public Radio's Eric Whitney reports\nRunning in a state that President Trump won by more than twenty points tester emphasizes that he can work with Trump he's run an ad listing Nineteen bills he supported the Trump is sign so when vice president Pence spoke in Bozeman yesterday he painted tester as a reliable and reflects of member of the Democratic resistance\nEat all the latest allegations of investigated senator Jones has already announced that he was voting no unjust off just like even though an Joes or\nTest or didn't take a position on Kavanaugh's confirmation until after last week's hearings were over and then came out against Kavanaugh citing first his record on privacy issues and support for the Patriot act\nFor those reasons and all the reasons that were brought up last week um I made a decision to vote no on judge Kavanaugh I don't think he\nHas the merits nor the background to uh meet the needs of Supreme Court\nRepublican challenger Matt Rosendale says he'd be a more reliable ally for President Trump and cited the Supreme Court vote as an example\nMyself and a lot of the people across this nation or very disturbed with the way this entire process that handled there is a man who has a commendable record and he should be serving on the banks an absolutely I Would vote for him\nOn paper standing firmly with President Trump would appear to be a winning strategy in Montana the population here skews older and wider than the U.S in general Montana also has the second highest population of veterans per capita of any state guys like Jim hunting felt [noise]\nRetired after Twenty years in the navy ending felt now volunteers at the airport\nIn Missoula helping arriving tourists he voted for President Trump\nGonna mess around with this country we're going to do something as no crosses the line of red Laurie\nWhile heading failed says he hell no didn't vote for President Obama like many Montana voters he isn't easy to pigeon hole he says he voted for tester before and for Democratic governors Steve bullock in twenty sixteen\nAnd he says a candidate support for the president or testers vote on Kavanaugh's nomination won't sway his choice\nNo because I don't use it as a platform to make my decision\nStill plenty of voters do see their vote as a sign of support for President Trump Bozeman retirees Suzie burden was at a senior community center yesterday near where vice president Pence was holding his campaign rally\nWell I think a precedent feeling marvelously actually\nHe keeps his promises and not many of them do\nPresident Trump is front and center in the Senate race here identity and local issues also matter for example tester has put Rosendale on the defensive about whether national forest in Montana could be privatized\nRosendale initially opposed federal land ownership but said these now convinced that that's not what people want and ... hard\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford ...\nLater this month for NPR News I'm Eric Whitney in Missoula, Montana [noise]\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\nNext on all things considered we'll hear about China's censorship efforts within its own borders end in other countries right now though let's check traffic again with Brian peacock\nJuice San Ramon six eighty southbound before ... canyon road there is a two car injury trash that has been move now to the ride shoulders traffic is recovering but still very thick from sycamore valley road north bound succeed delays from stone valley road through Walnut Creek to about ... road\nIn ...

has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAnd her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you\nMany people have been sharing the column on line that I spoke with Monica ... about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him that would make him cry someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect any and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I take to respond system people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world as a young one end\nAnd said they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of taboos in this area exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that\n[noise] you know it just just thinking about tropes in sitcoms where\nSaid dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery story that he can never make we do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this\nSponsorship of particularly the live stream by deference master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature bent political science and infection will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch dead for ...\nTwenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yeah please\nGear Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by then because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife uh forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi\nWhile so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you on murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone\nUm so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nIs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time because of what we're hearing and that they have enough for hearings because their fathers have said something like\nI'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you're a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ...
