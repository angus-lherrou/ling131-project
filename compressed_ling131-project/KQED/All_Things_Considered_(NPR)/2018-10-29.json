I I get it on our soldiers\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I talked to least our flesh or Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmothers and along with us but I mean I I spent a lifetime innocent guy this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified with what happened and I hope that we could for me comes through changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people that have been hacked on\nOn everybody in a community and work of are strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd are are they saturated with her niece who's sixteen alley they both so you know just as many generations of the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials well I wouldn't be\nThat tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and get support to the families that\n[noise] so so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and we said the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about they definitely need to have ... so we definitely don't need to have you know security guards on at our schools at our temples at our church as\nWe shouldn't have to I mean summer is supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers out to this but where we go to press on even safe so houses\nSponsorship of the cake DVD life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with a steady on demand\nSo thanks so much yeah let's talk to him\nAnd other Pittsburgh faith community strict time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life and I got the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service ... name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestle ... said he that he held a special service to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is fine but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our voice with our actions we can ensure that the hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today as well\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back and\nI open and affirming you mean other than every once in a while because everyone has welcomes right everyone is Raul command and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple\nOf ah folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer the words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship\nBut they do to come and to say thank you for doing this so that makes a difference if\nI ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I didn't have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses in on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events or because he's a police officer and wide hole nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives so it was very frightening pros personally\nUm but I\nI Try to allow dodge the urge to give me the bowl ...\nThat I Need I I Do not fear for my show I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren but yet I Can't allow hatred to intimidate me\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue were baby naming ceremony was be must being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently in kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that and of course the nursery attended\nThat has always been something that's been on my mind just started here because I'm responsible for eight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating and defend the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head tenants planes that I've come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a show that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking and\nWe also met a father and son ... and Matthew mackerel really who were in attendance at the special services for that in order said his own life experiences allow him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American ... we're going to know about

gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond\nHave gathered in a packed auditorium NPR's Quil Lawrence has outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community all day Quil welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is a big Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... some lovely now you also spent some time in squirrel hill the neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there\nYeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going through Sunday services and you could see the diversity of the community it's notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI came today that\nWaiting patients and now today I think I'm going to let them read the articles and news articles that I Want to start setting the talk of the class and just give them a space I have\nFound that to happen and what they thought they were really moved by family been fighting the Holocaust and weak\nAnd people were saying that you know a little town like that you never think can happen but in today's America they realize it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to the point this is a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was the second how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I rented to Dan Franco's he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a too with the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\nThey were really special Sweden or who are known for many years whenever I go\nTo the tree of life for a for a wedding or some sort of two of them are always a sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country ...\nAnd now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying this next\nI felt like people run the sorrow the soda cycle of sorrow and the pride in the solidarity of the community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence thank you\nThank you and as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this that are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children\nAnd how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you have actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately have covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things I'm not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue he also wants to other places tell us about that\nYeah I actually went over to the children's museum here and Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great when actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to go and

I'm Neal Conan and I'm headed Cox Richardson with a democracy test one of the great innovations of the American constitution is it ... of checks and balances each branch of government can apply a break on the others in particular Congress and the courts are supposed to check the power of the president\nBut the presidency is gathered more and more power over the last Seventy years and we now have a president who attacks Congress and the judiciary and when it suits them and mouse almost daily assaults on other institutions that can hold them to account the media and the career professionals in federal agencies like the FBI and the justice\nDepartment later this hour we'll hear about the erosion of the informal unwritten rules that can lubricate the machinery of government

the constitution they did not assume with the existence of political parties\nAre that's odd it away because the constitution itself creative what you might call the first party system federalist and anti federalist but they did not assume that the branches would be affected by party loyalty I think what you're seeing in this period since Trump's election\nIs a Republican Party that has largely decided not to play it's traditional role in Congress that the Congress rather than being a check on the president is choosing to support him in the courts particularly the lower courts\nWe're going to see if the Supreme Court proves to be a check their reasons to doubt that\nThe biggest check we do have is not so much in the constitution although it's part of the constitution it's in the larger acceptance of small D democratic values in the country\nSo the ... outside the government both the in political mobilization which is happening in a big way in the country and also in a free media which is doing a lot of the investigating that Congress isn't doing\nI think one of the things we forget when we used to go back to the Watergate period is\nThat in Watergate you had all of the institutions working in tandem to hold the president accountable the courts played a critical role in this\nCongressional investigations played a critical role in this for a member of that the Congress was controlled by Democrats and obviously the media played a critical role now you are missing important pieces in that system of checks and balances and I think we are so far see the outcome\nLet's look at how we got here EJ when people look at the Supreme Court today for example they tend to look at President Trump's judicial appointments which has moved to court to them right\nAnd yet this is really nothing new this process started all the way back in the Reagan Administration when Reagan attorney general Edwin Meese very famously said the idea was to institutionalize the Reagan Revolution so they can't be set aside no matter what happens in future presidential elections\nPush us into our own little camps that can be exaggerated but I Do think that\nThe nature of our conversation now is different and I don't want to romanticize\nThe past you can argue that online media have opened up the political system to all kinds of points of view and that in the old system there might have been too much or leaked control I can see that argument but I think the lack of any kind of common agreement on a set of facts\nMake political argument much more difficult because if he at least you agree on facts you can argue about what to do about them if you don't agree on facts anymore than there's almost no way to carry on a coherent argument and I worry that that's the direction we're going in\nEgypt to teach me you're describing a system where certainly the Republican Party in increasing we both parties are interested more in partisan advantage an idiom logical purity as you describe it how do we get back to a system where there are at least in crises more interested in the national interest\nYou know there's an interesting case and it's a very controversial one where partisanship did disappear for a moment of crisis\nAnd that was the bank bailout back in two thousand eight and the irony there is the bank bailout was called for by President Bush all Republican the bulk of the votes for the bail out came from Democrats in Congress\nThey didn't much like it either but there was a feeling that in the middle of this crisis when the entire economy could collapse if this didn't happen no matter what injustices might be involved in the bank bailout\nThe damage to everyone would have been worse so we at least have some occasions when we come together we also came together and remarkable way obviously after nine eleven when President Bush's approval rating rose to the eighties or nineties\nSome argued that that strong consensus actually became a problem because we inadequate we debated the Iraq War\nAfterwards I Would note that in both of those cases it was largely Democrats went over to the other side and said All right we're going to support Bush even though we didn't like this and after nine eleven there was a decision made that we wanted to unite behind our president who many Democrats\nDisagreed with I'd like to think that would be good in circumstances like that when Republicans would do that for a Democratic president\nI just haven't seen that in recent years I'd like to believe that it's true the one clear example on the other side is when um Syria crossed President Obama's red line\nThe beginning of a second term in using chemical weapons it is true that John Boehner the speaker and Eric Cantor the number two Republican support at President Obama\nBut there was so much opposition in the Republican Party and as well as the Democratic party that there was no agreement reached so we haven't we seen some occasions when a national threat brought people together I Hope we will see a clear\nHope we will see a clear example of that on the Republican side some day in this period those have been very hard to find I Am very sorry to say\nWe've talked about the checks and balances of the different branches of government on themselves and each year in the past have talked about the fourth and most important check on the political system\nAnd that's a check the voters you've talked a lot about the role of voters and making sure that they have control over their government and you have some interesting ideas about how we can make that happen\n[noise] right well I Am for an idea that's going to take a long time if ever to take hold which is what I call universal voting and what is in Australia called compulsory attendance at the polls where I think that there should be an obligation on all of us to vote\nHow it works in Australia is people pay a very small fine if they don't vote it's not onerous but\nIt's a declaration that this is a civic duty no less than serving on a jury is a civic duty one of the reason I like this idea is that it suddenly changes the obligations of state and local governments they would have to stop\nMaking it more difficult to vote and begin to make it easier for people to do their civic duty so that's one thought I have a second thought I have is a and a lot of other people have obviously is some kind of single transferable boat system where\nOne of the problems in our system is if in a given election you are inclined to vote for a third party candidate the very likely outcome of that vote or one very likely outcome of that vote is you help elect the candidate you released like\nAmong the two party candidates it discourages third party boating obviously but it also can create non majority area and outcomes with the transferable boat\nYou put a number one next to your first choice which might be a third party candidate but then you can put a number to next to say to the Kennedy from one or the other parties\nThat is closest to your view that guaranteed that the winter in some sense reflect a majority view but it also creates gives creates some give\nIn the political system I Am not anti partied myself I don't see how you organize a democratic system without parties and I think we're barking up the wrong tree if we\nSay all our problems are caused by political parties if only they would go away\nIf this party system went away it would be replaced by another party a system because people come together to with people who are more or less their allies to try to influence government that's democracy but there are moments when the system\nNeeds some lubrication some adjustments um you know into the idea is that I Am sympathetic to the transferable vote in a universal boating I think could\nStrike than ours small D democratic system\nThat idea of universal suffrage the idea that the government must guaranteed everybody votes as opposed to members of different political parties trying to make sure that their opponents don't know\nSeems to me it'd be a really interesting and very effective way to make sure that that final check and balance on the government that of voters actually works\nWeight and one of the reasons I'm I think universal boating might gain some support overtime although I Know it's a long shot\nIs that it does two things one amenable to progressive same wasn't amenable to more middle of the road people on the one hand it would increase the turnout of young people of lower income people\nWho are often the folks most kept away by various measures to make it harder to vote\nOn the other hand it would also make our system somewhat less city illogical because\nMany of the voters who stay away from elections or people with less hard hardened idiot logical views and so the combination of those too could be\nI think secretary choose a political debate I mean I Am unapologetically a person in the center left I Am very clear about my own views\nI actually think it would be useful for both sides to have to make a case\nTo voters who don't necessarily share of their particular uh uh eighty allergy that that is has been the effect down in Australia weather system has worked very well and I like to say we got the secret ballot from Australia so why don't we
