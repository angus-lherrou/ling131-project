Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first ... forest can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\n[noise] I Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been dating like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support the immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration in this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nFresh air comes on tonight at seven o'clock\nSet the alarm on the cake you weedy listen live app and wake up to MORNING EDITION start

overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights as a political action group focused on black women voters and candidate\nAnd more than a hundred of these living our meetings were happening that night across the country do you go around and the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well but once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and plus he had that followed the presidential election I think the ...\nBy the women's Iraq had asked you and that is [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did tip in favor of Donald Trump so\nWhite women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think I Would vote has been taken for granted\nUm I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with\nUm everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama with black women who delivered that ... that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters on twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nAs you can see he's ... he's the entire labor family we show what is\nWay to know\nWhy why are\nWe\nIn that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya burst\nIsn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every\nElection cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and that's why when we ... we had a stronger voice\nWould actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually\nMissing urgency there's nothing happens to me\nI should Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nI wrote in relationships in the middle of it because I was in the ... the other police officers say something life while he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad is the suit my brother's these three there are all star game we use slim bills\nLike every man in the polls\nBut these women also talked about education and and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything for being Berkes resented the implication additives zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman properly right now she's making her own ... to be part of the leadership that the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuse says she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem they take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value\nOf African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC or directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that\nShe could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nA conversation with Ayanna Pressley
