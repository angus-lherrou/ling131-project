in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which isn't a three percent decline here to talk about ... what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what made the market\nEh yeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contribute and let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop praising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so\nIt will stop praising benchmark rates between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their fear than inflation right now well\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today's sell off is not the end of the bowl marketed stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe his cool Tibet as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going to do just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by a sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today of wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this ball market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today\nAnd that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tax lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech and very tough day isn't just the beginning of a long time or trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the doubt down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling a given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses\nIt's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down but we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession\nWe're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates they're paying you starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets
