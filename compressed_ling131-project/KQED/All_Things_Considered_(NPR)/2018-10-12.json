his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful in the coming to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people that database or white\nEach person and you start to base it would be called that illuminate hundreds of them ... so it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in these debates as to actually identify you\nThe same way that the GPS these then you get multiple better like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need a judge correctly need to\nLike where a person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly

gets you criminals all you can pitch criminals as these technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either to commit\nSo early says the findings raise questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come into the using these techniques to find these really like you know murderers and\n... people but uh we'll pay review can be sickening to identify people that I don't know from a demonstration for lifting DNA behind a wheel K with these foreign governments are going to exploited the technique\nTo identify us for their

genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crime to sway\nWe're working on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect you know murders of children things like that it just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd great tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow and that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to their children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't

responsible for the disappearance of Jim ... who's been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week\nSounds made congressman Ro Khanna has been an outspoken critic of the Saudi Arabian government and its ties to the U.S\nAnd congressman Cano according to reporting from the New York times ... who's an outspoken critic of the Saudi Government was assassinated by Saudi agents and the Washington Post is reporting on U.S intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials\nThat it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go with this far to allegedly killed one of their critics\nCan you imagine that this actually happened in the way the Turkish officials did\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference it's almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different

a developing retina that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light colored Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson Eldridge shot chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe've discussed this crazy idea of could we use the human reading all organized to study how we get the different colors sensing fill in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision in a fly or even a mouse\nOf using human cells with key because you can't study human color vision and a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't read they don't have these red detecting cells and so we really have to study in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first income cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that I write a hormone was involved in the development of these colors ... so called come so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added direct harm onto that dish during their development and we got more red green con developing on and that was organized and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that die right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new Gulf\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that's the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision that condition that's been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular so Johnson hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular organized\nSteven backer of the national eye Institute says studies like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in a human I these studies\nShow that the similarity is quite high and Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature control the development of the retina so that we can understand better why things go wrong and\nDisease
