choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments have\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the meat\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber yes\nYou have a one seat majorities and Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nAh what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes ... votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the dry you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority and votes and you had Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right well\nI Would raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interests of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure versus\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to a personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nYou had a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand Eighteen\nWell certainly always need to be prepared offered the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for our way of I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of

cafes aren't serving so you need a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio scent of a water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking

pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIf he loses too much pressure to city won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there a says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control it how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and weather

for when we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments have\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nTie between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the drawing you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere were some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where that came from right\n[noise] well I Would raise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representative so people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a state wide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes for the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um UC ... Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nYou had a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand acting\nWell certainly always need to be prepared offered the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties\nThe Democratic and progressive movement seems historically it'd be more focus on sort of installing a a a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the locality\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one

risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there a says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe

will decide whether to remove the limits on rent control throughout the state\nBut three cities in the East Bay will also vote on local measures regarding rent control ... politics and government reporter guide Marshall Roddy is here to talk us through those hey guy Hey Ryan let's start with Berkeley and measure cue\nThis seems to be directly connected to prop ... at the state level\nIn most of measure cue in Berkeley would not even go to in effect in less ... so they're really closely tied together and tied around this idea that prop ten really what it does is return rent control to local control it will allow local governments to make their own decisions around rent control\nSo we're Berkeley went ahead and did this summer is put this measure on the ballot to kind of map out the rules if\nRent control suddenly now allowed in California's prop ... passes here's what the city would do and the biggest part of that is setting a twenty year rolling date for when buildings can come under rent control so basically\nBuildings on the twentieth birthday so to speak would now be eligible for rent control but that does now suddenly mean a lot of buildings built in the eighties and nineties will be\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream thanks Sandy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices in the home\nI'm Free you know rent raises into the future\nHa and Alameda this is measure Kay on the ballot there and it's actually landlords who has put this on the ballot\nExactly and they're looking to a future where they don't want changes to the city's rent laws right now Alameda doesn't have rent control you know if you want to raise the rent you have to go through the hearing process is not real rent control there is no just cause ordinance restricting addiction\nSo landlords in Alameda or like let's lock this into place and make sure the city council can't go back in the year and fiddle with this so what you know measure K. there would really do with lock in the current laws and any changes that would come in the future would have to go back before voters\nAnd Oakland last but not least this is not about limits on rental rates ... what is it about what's the debate with measure why\nIn Oakland right so this is again just cause ordinances which restrict the conditions that someone can be victims so we're not talking about actually limiting the prices of rentals\nBut putting in place protections in in this case extending protections on when a landlord can kick somebody out so well Oakland measure why would do is extending that to duplex is and ... says um where you know owners live onsite these smaller units that have been exempted from just cause in the past that thinking being that these are the kind of mom and pop landlords\nWho you might just be renting out extra units in their place as kind of a way to make ends meet 'em but you know the mayor and and now the other city council members have gotten behind this the thought being you know without just costs protections addictions are one way that landlords can really jak operates the law in the books and California is if you can get a renter out\nThen you can move your rent up to market rate so this would basically extend protections and make it harder or at least give make landlords give a legit reason um when they're addicting

coverage of the status of the so called California Dream ... senior political editor is Scott Shafer examines two very different views of prop five\nElection night June Nineteen Seventy eight in Los Angeles anti tax crusader Howard Jarvis reveled in the overwhelming passage of proposition Thirteen\nNow we are watching it is your responsibility to make proposition Thirteen works by the federal

would be so for over a million in this neighborhood but they do but they do\nBecause of prop Thirteen Ken's property taxes are kept relatively low and proposition five on the November ballot would

Berkeley went ahead and did this summer is put this measure on the ballot to kind of map out the rules if\nRent control suddenly now allowed in California's prop ... passes\nHere's what the city would do and the biggest part of that is setting a twenty year rolling date for when buildings can come under rent control so basically buildings on their twentieth birthday so to speak would now be eligible for rent control but that does now suddenly mean a lot of buildings built in the eighties and nineties will be eligible\nUm some measure cute as that and then also sets a new base fine I'm for you know rent raises into the future\nHa and Alameda dishes measure Kay on the ballot there and it's actually landlords to have put this on the ballot\nExactly and they're looking to a future where they don't want changes to the city's rent laws right now Alameda doesn't have rent control you know if you want to raise the rent you have to go through the hearing process is not real rent control there is no\nJust cause ordinance restricting evictions so landlords in Alameda or like let's lock this into place and make sure the city council can't go back in the year and still with us so what you know measure K. there would really do with lock in the current laws and any changes that would come in the future would have to go back before voters\nAnd Oakland last but not least this is not about limits on rental rates what is it about what's the debate with measure why\nIn Oakland right so this is again just cause ordinances which restrict the conditions that someone can be victims so we're not talking about actually limiting the prices of rentals\nBut putting in place protections in in this case extending protections on when a landlord can kick somebody out so well Oakland measure why would do is extending that to duplex is in ...\nUm where you know owners live onsite these smaller units that have been exempted from just cause in the past the thinking being that these are the kind of mom and pop landlords who you might just be renting out extra units in their place as kind of a way to make ends meet\n'em but you know the mayor and and now the other city council members have gotten behind this the thought being you know without just cause protections addictions are one way that landlords can really jak operates the law in the books and California is if you can get a renter out\nThen you can move your rent up to market rate so this would basically extend protections and make it harder or at least give make landlords give a legit reason um when they're addicting someone\n... guy Mars already a lot to keep track of you're doing a great job thank you thank you\nHigh cost of housing isn't a new issue for California voters back in Nineteen Seventy eight the controversial proposition Thirteen rolled back property taxes and put a strict limits on annual increases now a new ballot measure proposition five seeks to expand prop Thirteen\nAs part of our coverage of the status of the so called California Dream ... senior political editor is Scott Shafer examines two very different views of prop five\nElection night June Nineteen Seventy eight in Los Angeles anti tax crusader Howard Jarvis reveled in the overwhelming passage of proposition Thirteen\nNow we are watching it is your responsibility to make proposition Thirteen works by telling the pharaohs lard out of the government budget\nForty years later they're still simmering debate over prop Thirteen impact but there's little question longtime homeowners like Ken Wilkins have benefited\nThis house with addictions here can we throw down her leads us to it\nKen Wilkins walks me down as blocking north of Oakland eventually we get to the home he bought forty two years ago\nI imagine if you bought this in Nineteen Seventy six you've done pretty well actually costs left in this car [laughter]\nCar called Twenty one thousand I think and it was less than that\nI never dreamed that a house with the sole for over a million in this neighborhood where they do but they do\nBecause of prop Thirteen Ken's property taxes are kept relatively low and proposition five on the November ballot would expand prop Thirteen by allowing homeowners fifty five and older to take that lower tax bill and apply it to a new home anywhere in California it's an idea that appeals to realtors like Linda ... [noise]\nMy territory is primarily north Orange County which is ... and Ashley adjacent county\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by extending the firm Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home that would allow the\nOther people who've been in their homes for many years and had been able to benefit from proposition Thirteen it would help them\nBe able to transfer their property tax basis to the next property\nAnd more homes bought and sold mean more commissions for real ... but it has plenty of detractors who think prop Thirteen has been bad for California\nThis new measure is the son of prop Thirteen\nSan Francisco assemblyman David Hsu strongly opposes prop five\nThis is simply going to allow long time wealthier homeowners to continue to receive additional tax breaks while doing nothing for millions of Californians who are struggling and our housing crisis\nPeople like Brian ... if you can't see downtown but you can see all the way to Oakland on a nice day you can see mount Diablo Brian has lived in this one bedroom apartment in San Francisco for nine years rent control has kept it affordable for him and his partner Marcello now they're thinking about buying their own place\nWe grew up in the bay area we both have family who are still here and all of our friends are here are jobs are here we don't have any real desire to leave we'd love to stay if it was possible financially\nRyan and his partner make a good salary and they've saved up for a down payment but he says buying instead of renting will triple their monthly costs for housing\nMortgage property taxes homeowner's insurance ... fees so it's going to be a huge jump for us\nBut there's really nothing improper five to help wannabe homeowners like Brian afford their first home I Would imagine\nThat you would like a proposition to help first time homebuyers yeah that'd be great [laughter]\nYes we can make that work that'd be wonderful\nBackers of profit five
