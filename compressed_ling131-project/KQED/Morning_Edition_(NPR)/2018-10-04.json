bring in NPR's Ryan Lucas who has been following this story morning Ryan good morning so let's start with the FBI investigation itself I mean this was never supposed to actually draw conclusions about these allegations against Kavanaugh writing to remind us what additional information the Senate was hoping to get from this supplemental background check as they're calling it well\nThe answer to that question kind of depends on whether you're a Republican or Democrat so what Republicans wanted was for the FBI to focus on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations a and a second allegation from Deborah Ramirez about sexual misconduct\nOr that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course a classmate of Kavanaugh's uh her story is that a Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when they're both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations that for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off of those so\nA Democrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking um since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the alleged incidents but the key thing to remember here is that\nUh the White House is the one in control of the background investigation and the scope the FBI does this background investigation at the behest of the White House\nThe president controls the parameters and the president has said while he's fine if the FBI talks to anybody out there or that he was providing direction to the FBI based off of what Senate Republicans won it\nAlso

pressure\nAnd people get home on the weekends and the last thing in the world that want to do is get into their car and so I think it also has an impact on these communities because you have hundreds

they're\nOnly there because you have an able to afford a home to live there and I think some of these communities than you know there was an impact there were people aren't really invested in their

thousand more people are living in high rise towers are living in rehabilitated older buildings or people of all incomes\nReally reflecting the diversity of our city\nYou know as you said it's very expensive to live here and some others might might be asking the question have so there was just a Santa Clara county bond measure that we approved there's at a higher sales tax that we are now paying why should I vote for them [noise]\nFirst it's important to recognize that what happened with the county measure which was very important in a couple of years ago ... primarily focused on\nOne type of housing permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals\nThat's critically important but we know we need lots of times of affordable housing we need affordability for nurses and teachers and all the other folks who are working so hard to survive here so a primary motivation in putting this measure on the west to have greater flexibility and to be able to serve a broader cross section of our community\nHousing is really the issue of our time in history and\nThis is the defining challenge for us so kind of values demonstrate the rest of the world that we can be incredibly prosperous out what we haven't demonstrated yes how we can keep everybody on board met our prosperity\nAnd so if the narrative of a so called valleys demise is that a great place but nobody can afford to live there

visit rocket now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nUnder the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nIs the city different than it was when you were there early and\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nFor Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now\nSome electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is\nThe shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the air strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly\nTwo hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states the control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little aces here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nRight and it was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal but also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates they've got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve\nIf you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass round so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is
