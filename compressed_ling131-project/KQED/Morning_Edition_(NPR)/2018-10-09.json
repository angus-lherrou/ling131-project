I'm Brian what\nWhen the north bay fires broke out a year ago they swept through neighborhoods with ferocious speed many of the people living in the path of the fires had no idea what was coming they didn't receive any kind of emergency alert no tax and new calls to their cell phones or landlines\nA team of kick you read the reporters investigated what went wrong that night in ... one of those reporters joins me to talk about how California as a state and local counties\nAre changing their emergency communications Hi Maria reminding brain so take us back\nWhen you did your investigation what did you find where their problems and why didn't more people get warnings\nWell I Want to take you back and I want to take you back to that night I'm I'm In a play part of the nine one one call that we got as part of that investigation\nFor nine one one died [laughter] okay [laughter] Cal Fire need that for like ... area\nOkay [laughter] so Cal Fire need that for the Calistoga area mandatory evacuation [noise]\nSo you hear them talking here about a reverse nine one one and this is um you know a dispatcher calling into a county emergency center but what we're going to hear in a second is that they were kind of talking past each other because this reverse nine one one was called something different and not the county where the call came into\nThe well advised Cal Fire [noise] okay I'm Sorry what's your question [noise] okay to say they were ever found one I saw or I Need you guys to set out our first one line so we can tell them to evacuate [noise] I'm Sorry I'm not familiar with whatever I Want to I'm Sorry\nNot what you want to hear from an emergency dispatcher as a fire you know sweeps through populated neighborhoods and I think it speaks to the heart of these problems which is that there is no one statewide emergency alert system\nAnd the counties had different system some of them were opt in and so like Nick so if you would sign up ahead of time you might have been getting text and email but reverse nine one one is them calling your landline well that presents other problems landlines not everyone has them and a lot of cell phone towers burned down\nSo it's almost like they're speaking different languages\nThey were I mean this is the thing there's a lot of good things about the fact that we have a sort of devolved system of local control and then they're not so good things\nAnd you know I Would say the place that this came to the head the most was so now my county where we had the bulk of the people who died in this twenty four people died in that county alone\nAnd one of the reasons was if there was a very populated subdivision this was not a rural area where the fire jumped the freeway and and hit that neighborhood coffee park burned it to the ground and what we found was that people just happened in the middle of the night\nThey didn't know it was coming and there was a report done by the state later on and that kind of validated what we found in our investigation which is that their response was uncoordinated there was gaps\nThe communications broke down um and they said the official should've used what's known as wireless emergency alerts these are the amber alerts that go off on your cell phone when a kid gets kidnapped anywhere in the state\nSo if so DOMA county experienced another emergency on that scale would residents get more alert\nI think they would um and they're working on it actively and sort of moving forward they've been proactive in trying to figure out new ways to not only rule out these systems to test them last month they did some testing of two systems\nAnd reported there were still some significant issues and everyone getting those alerts so certain parts of the county like Greenville there were problems and lots of problems 'cause that's where flooding happened and so now my I'm so there's still work to be done but it is an ongoing process\nAnd there had been big fires since last year does it seem like there were any lessons learned\nI Would say absolutely there were still some tragic deaths than those fires but nothing like what we saw before I talked to Senator Mike McGuire who actually represents a huge swath of this nor the region um and he gave me an example in the Mendocino Complex fire in Lake County of what works better this time around\nAnd I mean if you know complex fire\nShare more made the decision about forty hours before or evacuation or issues for late for shooting voluntary evacuation notice that with the community noticed that there is a good situation closing in on him\nAnd says senator McGuire says that does voluntary evacuations did result in a lot of people leaving which of course made the mandatory evacuations much easier and he does feel that there's a lot more urgency on the part of folks like sheriff's who oversee evacuations since last year\nOkay so that's the county level but we know that shortly after the north the fires the Thomas Fire burn through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties that was followed by deadly mudslides what's happening at the state level to make sure that emergency communications are going out in a timely way\n[noise] so there's two major pieces of legislation that were passed and signed by Governor Brown this year um one was by hand best Jackson who represents that area in the central coast where that terrible mudslide happened\nUm and she really wanted to get to this issue of opt in versus opt out right and one of the problems we saw in the north bay with a lot of people didn't even know that they had to opt into an emergency system so here's how she described the legislation she authored\nIt so we will be a basically an opt out system you will automatically be included in this system that will be notified if there's an emergency particularly a fire and that the sheriff's department will be able to obtain that information from your utility bills but\nThey are only able to use that information for the very limited purpose of notifications in case of emergency\nAll right so what does the other building\nSo this one senator McGuire and it basically requires the state office of emergency services\nBy next year to collaborate with wireless companies state and local officials federal officials and create essentially a standard for every county to follow when it comes to emergency alert\nAnd it also you know requires a lot of like specific areas that we saw as problematic so there has to be timelines there has to be testing there needs to be redundancies\nAnd there has to be common terminologies that issue of speaking the same language\nUm and it will force we asked to create a training program\nFor counties and cities but they can learn how to do this so I asked Maguire is this enough and he said that this is not going to be finished this year or possibly for many years he says it in this day and age we need a state wide alert system\nUm and essentially said that there will probably be more legislation next year and he said quote the real work begins\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the

recently the head of Interpol the international police organization based in France was a man named among Hong way he's from China but in a stunning moved China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from Interpol\nI talk to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about my whole month\nAway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen\nHe became the first Chinese head of Interpol and there's no election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials that it deemed corrupt whiskey China\nBut as it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption what\nExactly are they investigating him for\nWhich has government has been released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife ... on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood even nights suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported in missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and they own France were in trouble is headquartered in here's what she said\nWait a way to go and you know what I'm speaking on behalf of men and women and children on the people of all the wind\nAnd children's husband and father so that they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their backs turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police\nWell when she talks there about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and smeared hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julia in Congo highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rule China he was China security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing month from the presidency of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for Interpol well\nEven before this happened China's use of it or fall under amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China tempted to issue a red notice that international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists readers are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with among is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob banks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceeding this isn't an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana leak gains reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead to face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff Jeff standard like stat system he's in Lewis Ken in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on further steps are going to be half of war or taking and their belts are going to be trained together so you're walking down the line it's kind of like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now you freeze up more of his officers for patrol Andy argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nNow we can take them right in the back and put them in front of a video camera the judge has access to the video camera on the conversation just like we are now but this just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davidson says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew 'em up because of uh watching everybody get up and go in front of the screen is either yes or a nose or you know you couldn't say anything\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOut trying to explain to the judge what happened and they told me to be quite\nSoon after David thing with that\nTo the judge what happened and they told me to be quite\nSoon after David thing was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison [noise]\nLayer Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as\nThe least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and after defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom from my client unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWhile there's little research on video court much out there shows it may increase fail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR

ambassador to the United nations is stepping down from her post I'm here now with NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele ... morning Michele I'm learning so this seems to have come as a big surprise do we know wind Nikki Haley stepping aside well\nWe're only hearing um bits and pieces of their announcement right now I'm ... ... but I Will say that\nYou know Haley has been spending a lot of less time at the Security Council except for this past month of course which was the big U.N General assembly which has been doing more speeches more parents elsewhere she already seemed to have been not long for the job\nI'm and she seemed to be kind of\nTrying to keep her her own um\nImage or own a sense of who she is and and as a politician I'm not completely tied to Donald Trump\nThat's interesting so although this may seem like big news for people for people who cover diplomacy it's maybe not the most surprising news\nWell I had been hearing rumblings awhile ago that she was kind of not long for the job and we're in what were you hearing from President Trump today is that he told that she told them six months ago that she wanted to take some time off at the end of after two years in office um he\nIs quoted as saying that he hopes Haley will come back in a different role he says you can take your pick and so far Haley you know isn't really pushing him aside are criticizing him or anything to the contrary she's saying that\nOther countries may not like what the us is does but they respected so again she she kind of keeps her distance from Trump but also supports them\nLet's put her in the in the broader context of this administration which has been critical of the United nations on on several fronts how successful has she been at articulating the president's policies and what do people at the un think of her you\nKnow she is very tough and she went in a very tough saying things like we're going to take names of people who support us and who don't I'm On the other hand you know she has supported continued payments to most un buddies um\nYou know she wants to do things like a cut back on the amount of money that the U.S is paying but when you know the rubber hits the road she has been supportive of a lot of of things going on at the un\nAnd I think the un secretary general has had a very good relationship with her he's a politician to is the former prime minister Portugal\nAnd he seemed to have kind of a report knowing that you know Haley as a politician of course but also you know when their when their ideas align things like pushing for more efficient a un system\nYeah he could work with her and I think that that kind of relationship has done a the un well for the past couple of years uh we'll see what happens next\nGiven as you say that there have been rumblings that she may be on her way out do we have a sense of who might be a candidate to succeed Nikki Haley\nWell I'm you know I haven't heard some solid names I mean there was a lot of talked before about Dina Powell who left the White House before she was\nA Bush administration official and went back to New York so she might be a possibility I'm the one thing you can bet is that John Bolton is going to have a big day and that he's the national security advisor um\nHe was the Bush administration's ambassador to the un in a big critic of the world body\nYeah [noise] Michel ... is

think it speaks to the heart of these problems which is that there is no one state wide emergency alert system\nAnd the counties had different system some of them were opt in and so like Nick so if you had signed up ahead of time you might have been getting text and email but reverse nine one one is them calling your landline well that presents other problems landlines not everyone has them and a lot of cell phone towers burn down\nSo it's almost like they're speaking different languages\nThey were I mean this is the thing that there's a lot of good things about the fact that we have a sort of devolved system of local control and then they're not so good things\nAnd you know I Would say the place that this came to the head the most was so now my county where we had the bulk of the people who died in the twenty four people died in that county alone\nAnd one of the reasons was if there was a very populated subdivision this was not a rural area where the fire jumped the freeway and and hit that neighborhood coffee park burned it to the ground and what we found was that people just happened in the middle of the night\nThey didn't know it was coming and there was a report done by the state later on and that kind of validated what we found in our investigation which is that their response was uncoordinated there was gaps\nThe communications broke down um and they said the official should've used what's known as wireless emergency alerts theater there's amber alerts that go off on your cell phone when a kid gets kidnapped anywhere in the state\nSo if so DOMA county experienced another emergency on that scale would residents get more alert\nI think they would um and they're working on it actively and sort of moving forward they had been proactive in trying to figure out new ways to not only were allowed the systems that test them last month they did some testing of two systems\nAnd reported there were still some significant issues in everyone getting those alerts so certain parts of the county like Greenville there were problems and that's a problem because that's where flooding happens and so now I'm a I'm so there's still work to be done but it is an ongoing process\nAnd there had been big fires since last year doesn't seem like there were any lessons learned\nI Would say absolutely there were still some tragic deaths than those fires but nothing like what we saw before I talked to Senator Mike McGuire who actually represents a huge swath of this north bay region um and he gave me an example in the Mendocino Complex fire in Lake County of what works better this time around\nThe minutes you know complex fires\nShare floor made that decision about forty hours before mandatory evacuations were issued for lake worth issued voluntary evacuation notices that would that community notice that there is a dangerous situation closing in on them\nAnd says senator McGuire says that those voluntary evacuations did result in a lot of people leaving which of course made the mandatory evacuations much easier and he does feel that there's a lot more urgency on the part of folks like sheriffs to oversee evacuations since last year\nOkay so that took the county level but we know that shortly after the north the fires the Thomas Fire burn through Santa Barbara in Ventura counties that was followed by deadly mudslides what's happening at the state level\nThat was followed by deadly mudslides what's happening at the state level to make sure that emergency communications are going out in a timely way\n[noise] so there's two major pieces of legislation that were passed and signed by Governor Brown this year I'm One must by hand them at Jackson who represents that area in the central coast where that terrible and that's why it happened\nUm and she really wanted to get to this issue of opt in versus opt out right and one of the problems we found the north bay with a lot of people didn't even know that they had to opt into an emergency system so here's how she described the legislation she authored\nIt so it will be a basically an opt out system you will automatically be included in this system that will be notified if there's an emergency particularly of fire\nAnd that the sheriff's department will be able to obtain that information from your utility bills but they are only able to use that information for the very limited purpose of notifications in case of emergency\nAll right so what does the other building so that's why senator McGuire and it basically requires the state office of emergency services\nBy next year to collaborate with wireless companies state and local officials federal officials and create essentially a standard for every county to follow when it comes to emergency alert\nAnd it also you know requires a lot of like specific areas that we saw as problematic so there has to be timelines there has to be testing there needs to be redundancies and there has to be common terminology that issue of speaking the same language\nUm and it will force we asked to create a training program\nFor counties and cities that they can learn how to do this\nSo I asked Maguire is this enough and he said that this is not going to be finished this year or possibly for many years he says it in this day and age we need a statewide alert system\nUm and eventually hinted that there'll probably be more legislation next year and he said quote the real work begins and twenty Nineteen ...

peninsula del Rey nowadays forty three it's time for a listener commentary the implications of the me too movement had been profound for women but Dr we'll coordinate says the burden of the truths women are speaking really falls on men\nIt was a year ago that the phrase me to was the first tweet it as a hash tag it set up a firestorm of claims of sexual abuse by men and riveted the world's attention on the issue of sexual violence against women [noise] but there's a problem with how we think about this issue we think of it strictly as a woman's issue\nWhen we defined sexual violence as a women's issue it misses the critical point that nearly all perpetrators arm that most men are not sexual predators but nearly all sexual predators are male every minute and a half so when it's sexually assaulted in the U.S sent over Ninety five percent of all assailants our mail\nWhen we called sexual violence a women's issue men stop paying attention they think it's a problem for women to solve\nBut it's also a men's issue at issue with the culture of manhood that normal life was dominance over others in sexual aggression to effectively address the problem with sexual violence we must address manhood in America and they should do that it's certainly not witness responsibility\nNo it's our responsibility as men to change the culture of masculinity the producers and enables sexual predators him to redefine what a normal at acceptable behaviors from them\nAs men we can no longer be bystanders to remain silent in the face of sexual violence is essentially a form of consent we need to break that silence we need to stand with women as allies support they're speaking out challenges stand up to this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "San
