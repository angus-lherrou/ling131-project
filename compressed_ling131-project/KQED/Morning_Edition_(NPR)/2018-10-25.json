federal investigators trying to determine at this stage\nWill surely the key is trying to obviously ... the perpetrator or the the individuals who are responsible for my own devices\nAnd they're really looking at it from a two perspectives one is the forensics that is involved in each of the devices and the fact that there are multiple devices is actually very helpful to the investigators because they can compare and contrast and and just get a a richer picture if you will\nOf that forensic data set and so that includes things like is there are their fingerprints is their DNA or the hair fibers just different things that the the experts will look at the other aspect is the intelligence part of it\nAnd that really has two parts also won the was there prior intelligence meaning

four percent the hang saying index in Hong Kong flipped by a full percentage point but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China's stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January\nAnd its currency has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob you learning about I spent thirty percent top pertain to stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\nWith China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it is in\nA great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years to President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is trying to manipulating its currency\nWhat what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump has imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here and trying to kind of me\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency is like bitcoin is the latest solution coming for big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place they were an old papers people were talking about how he can help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nWays led agriculture\nPerfect oils frustration our\nSometime in such as the climate change coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about ...

distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is the main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer due endings human trafficking now even climate

still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to MIT is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use ... to verify the accounting and to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those\nIs that it's just there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars that pollute because I said before\nMissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute the call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nCould help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt doesn't say Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the stations that are actually more

for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday\nYou know I'm not sure it means anything for college basketball I'm a ... in in total\nBecause what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on and a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball for as long as I can remember\nAnd that is basically they're channeling of money from a one source um to the\nFamilies of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes that date is a Nike uh those those uh operations\nHave gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money so the the surprise here is that it has been criminalize a by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. as it's been done for years and it used to be\nThat the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from the NC double a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man\nNow which is which is a step ...\nNow you could possibly go behind bars which is uh what these uh these three men are facing\nWell you have these three men facing that you say um but I Wonder your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins wrote recently that the real defend in here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this did you see the same way that she does\nI I don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the euro universes were being the fraud it by this system a because\nBy funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players eligible under NC double a rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the university has given them scholarships and therefore they had to fraud at the universities of um of of value which is a a a a very strange thing to me because I\nStill don't know how that's fraud I mean universities or a University of basketball programs at football programs are still going to get these talented players\nUnder their very hum a low level of remuneration a for

S.\nThe economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years to President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is kind of manipulating its currency\nBut what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing [noise]\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to be depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation that's a lasting China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and\nChina by these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a Carlos I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U.

systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there was a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch we want to make the whole climate

disrupt everything eat those is that it's just there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says

to commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your inquiries each week about how politics and government work either Cokie hype the that is certainly a big question now this relationship works and here's our first question\nThis is Nicole ... comes from Nashville, Tennessee in the U.S Saudi Arabia special relationship really based primarily an oil for arms arrangement or there's something more to it\n[noise] well it's not oil for arms into oil and arms\nOf recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices\nBut it's also purchasers President Trump has repeatedly said of arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states has seen Saudi Arabia's a check on Iran both in the region internationally and to the extent that it's alive issues us also thinks that Saudi Arabia\nCould be helpful and then the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nNow oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Sean Philip Morris I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S views Saudi Arabia before oil was fang thank you\nBasically there was no view before or oil was a thing a lot of the Arabian as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year inside an agreement with standard oil California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started a relationship with the U.S\nWas Abdulazeez evens out he had forty five sons Steve and all the king's since his death in Nineteen fifty three of them one of those times the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nI was out of the south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence does the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert a the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off\nAccess to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided with the Saudis but they're staring and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nCake you read the FM San Francisco ... north islands

twenty two minutes past seven this is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning us markets opened up this morning after a rough day yesterday the Dow was trading up at that point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets swings can morning ... good morning I'm All right so it has been a choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has been going on\nIt's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might effects it might affect U.S companies\nAre you're starting to see some of that already a caterpillar which makes farm equipment and three am which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts\nAh this we talked about how that's starting to affect their bottom line\nNow on the plus side the economy and labor market are and have been chugging along so there are no clear indications that that's going to hit a wall or some companies are beating expectations and although interest rates are heading up there still historically low\nAll right so some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector yesterday the NASDAQ which is made up of a lot of tech stocks I had one of the worst days in seven years and this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector\n... well the technology sector has been on an even steadier and stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer or you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars in market value so basically St Patrick's have already risen very high end up a lot\nFurther to fall a and when you have a few companies talking as he saw this week about week sales or miss profits\nOn that makes investors nervous that perhaps the stocks overvalued and tech is a great example actually of how the volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and\nAT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted the Asian tech stocks including Sony and Sampson to fall overnight but then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms and send U.S companies including Microsoft and Twitter this morning and that's helping shore up some of those losses\nSo it kind of good contagion they're eating is nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day in and said this could continue for a while really quickly why is that\nIt's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy headed how much of a trade war is going to affect companies and into investors feel they have a clearer picture on that\nYou are likely to see strong reactions to any kind of news that can be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance a later today with Amazon and Google is alphabet reporting their earnings NPR's Yuki Noguchi thanks so much thinking well\nAccording to un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back the carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes\nBlocks chained the technology behind crypto currency is like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from the tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place an old papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nAgriculture\nUrban oils grocery show our\nSome dumb and ... the climate change cold which he came to the conferences spread awareness about watching [noise] so what is it\nA long chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like watching\nIs like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut instead on the computers of everyone on the block ching transparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer due endings human trafficking no even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall game all used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitch it he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\nNoriega watching based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon market in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do so I just like Douglass Macaulay ... ... a researcher\nSo do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those\nIs that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute\nBecause I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nSays could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's just as they can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the stations that are actually more important to make the party that problem something then solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change Mack says there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nFor NPR News I'm
