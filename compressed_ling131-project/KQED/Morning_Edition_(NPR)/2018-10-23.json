Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to

partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are actually going to um represent the people\nLet's be blind to when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nHow are you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans

one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty Eighteen will be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so\nThe impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one

I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep much at stake this fall as Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage their relations for state offices\n... of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others they will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address what\nWe're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election and the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nHow are you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans in conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nNo I don't have criticized the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand eighty\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen\nThe governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process and twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so\nThe impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing we've\nRaised I guess about a gift for over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who's running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the the the laws as they had been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitutions as a they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally\nA ... and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made your mature ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama windy\nLow [noise] they go low we what did you mean\nOr what I meant ... ... ... in that remark was that ah I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that or parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate [noise] well\nI certainly think votes through protests um I I can save it just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going act them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump ... who's very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington to\nAsk for more than ... gun safety measures\nThose are the kinds of ways I think which the people\nShould or should express themselves attorney general holder thanks so much and I think you [noise]\n\nAll right Steve mega millions lottery is up to one point six billion ... billion billion with a B ... set for tonight and yes it's a very exciting but your chances our chances and that one in three hundred million\nNow some people come up with plans to improve their odds and the big one is getting a bunch of coworkers together and forming in office pool what about that\nOne in

basically the same\nJason Kirkland is a lawyer who represents jackpot winters and he says if your office pool does somehow when that is not necessarily good\nThere could be a lot of problems with office pools\nYeah sometimes not everybody knows who's and the group or out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nI've been involved where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I understand why people do it because a you know you'll feel terrible if you're off his wife and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those I Would never say not to and I understand that there's always peer pressure because you don't want to be the one person left out so I'm not going to say not to\nBut he will say this that the last thing in the art twenty
