Adam Gopnik about George Carlin and why is George Carlin mentioned oaks\n... as an American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both and she called and\nWe have no more people in this country norm are all people we shift them all away\nAnd we brought in these senior citizen

right and we wanted to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is for what we're mocking is\nThe absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise\nBut Carlin's real point was that it it does our\nReactions to it that actually have like I have a negative fat and it gets worse with every generation has a whole batch is about um shell shock becoming pie TST no he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... direct language to settle those shell shocked and then it became battles the battle for the for some of those now takes a little

know and now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially at a town where the seats are a lot lighter\nDid you get people see her in her white cane and walk a

okay so what's your situation we're doing Sean ... okay so recently we sat down with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about\nOur name all thing we were talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nYou got his I got a little insistence labeling assistant because you were like ... we are now yes I said that are and I was like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do are now you know it's like but is there a story and you're like no no I didn't\nSay that I just said that that that that if you understood what our innate does you realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's like that yeah well as often\nHappens you or me down ... and it was like All right fine let's just try it and they'll say you know\nSo when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town not secure your son's getting married yes he was and uh her I was doing like tech team work for me [laughter]\nOkay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using that genetic code to translate it into proteins mhm [noise] right and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than that discovery the double helix structure really yeah\nIt was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's the quick story so what happened was\nOkay suggest to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing in that when you're born you get half your DNA from mom and a half your DNA from your dad Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically the recipe of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string\nA T C and gee that's it\nBut he's the problems he like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy teen piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated like\nHow did this for simple base has become the in the last it's become hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nHow do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person to really think seriously\nAbout this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ... this is a code problem\n... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein\nSo I just need to think of a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nTo active duty ... if you can see the good\nAnd then out comes the protein\nThat what what simple toad could I Do to do that\nAnd just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out decide I think\nThat ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\n[noise] like instead of a T. C. G. A.

Sacramento and live on my ... that are worth the time four o'clock\n[noise]\nOf all the predictions the pundits have gotten wrong in recent decades one of the most compelling has to do with city cities were supposed to die out\nThe proliferation of the automobile and everyone would move to the suburbs and never come back the decline of urban manufacturing in the city itself\nWould decline and then there's all the crime and noise pollution and chaos cities are known for who on earth would ever want to live in any city as it turns out just about everyone we're in the middle of an historic unholy ... predicted rise\nIn the urban innovation happening here in America in all over the world one problem many of our cities are old means they're not exactly optimized for the twenty first century and not so easy to retrofit an entire city\nSo building a new city for the twenty first century and beyond to scratch our mission\nIs to use technology to really redefined urban life and the twenty first century\nToday on freakonomics radio look at the city of the future with a man who's been rebuilding New York city for the past few decades man some people call a modern day Robert Moses the controversial mastered builder decades past [noise] like I think if\nSomebody says it in meaning that they got a lot done um then I think it's a compliment I think if somebody says oh you did a lot of top down planning and you displace lots of people\nThan it would be an insult it would also I think not be true\n[noise] along the way he learned central paradox successful cities the question\nIs how do you actually manage supply and demand\nA conversation with the major league credentialed urban and Dr off to ... get comfortable that's what he did\nI Am sitting leaning back and looking at the guy who are [noise]\n\n\nIs freakonomics radio show that explores banking side of everything here's your house even now [noise]\nAnd here's your house even got married [noise]\n\nIf you happen to live in New York City is I Do there's a name it's been routinely popping up for a few decades now always attached to interesting and often controversial project shirt I'm Dan doctor off but don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name\nBut his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states you grow up in Michigan came a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but he settled in in his wife started raising their family here\nHe worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces who finds the urban bridges too good to pass up this went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York hot to host the Olympics\nAnd a eventually that that idea became a bit of a movement it drew the attention of Mike Bloomberg with the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh I don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less beam air\nWhich as you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump Rand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well voters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal smart self made fiercely pragmatic and he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about\nHe was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterated in September eleventh terrorist attack less than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred an eighth mayor\nNow Bloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other neophyte to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven or he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDan doctor off did that job for six years\nHe then asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nAnd Bloomberg was finally done being mayor into thousands Thirteen after squeezing out a third term despite a pre existing two term limit he considered running for president you considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and all you know with a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't wanna go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today a CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nOkay let's back up to before the un doctor off was unknown quiet [noise]\nSo you were for many years\nObsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you've got the lady wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursued you pursue you pursue you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed and then um ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee bill\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then that would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they use the deadlines of the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite the science of what kind of region will benefit from it all depends\nOn the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced\nThink that might have had a real impact right we could have argued look all these people are coming\nI think it could have been a deadline to getting for example congestion pricing done but at the end of the day you know much of what we wanted to do as part of the Olympic plan and that was re developing the waterfront you know in Brooklyn or queens or the whole west side of Manhattan or the high line or regeneration in Coney Island in\nHarlem and flushing\nAreas that have been largely ignored for a long period of time got a big boost from the fact that we bid for the Olympics\nI ... to give me Dan in just a minute or two what you would consider the best accomplishments of the Bloomberg administration\nToday with any quality of the highest rates in the depression is our democracy ready to answer the challenge again here that program to democracy test coming up this evening at six and then at seven\nIn the next how do we need a guy who stop at nothing to eat yogurt company in business I did what any self respecting entrepreneurs as I called my mother and I borrowed the thirty thousand dollars\nFrom her tiny ... to ...\nHour an economic and innovation planning making an illness\nOr [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDoctor off started his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York\nAnd at least [laughter] yeah well the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to uh build what's called Hudson Yards which is this\nArea on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided that the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for what it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally and the world and so we\nEventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem that led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible but pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer or something else\nThat is exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the building literally moves or an it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather to shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental ism of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of the big city like New York\nThat's a great way of saying you know another way of expressing as say cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends begin to change I think that is a very different notion of the cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me and\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble and the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down\nAnd the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent on ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration would immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be\nA beautiful park and a manatee I Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard um and just getting anything done often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that what we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and Institute\nI'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system and basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivized firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives or to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy it was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been to bribe companies to stay or bribe companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user and so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for papal from all over the world\nYou know it was sort of this optimistic sense that produces incredible energy I'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that\nMost places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became [noise]\nYep you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know you know how hard it is to change your own personality it's hard to change the city's personality but that doesn't mean you can't you know structure around your strengths and structure around your weaknesses\nRoom\nWith city unlike people reading companies can be as we noted earlier difficult to retrofit not just physically all those buildings that transportation and energy infrastructure but also psychic clean culturally economically which is why doctors\nConcluded ... will be really interesting to start the city from scratch [noise] two dozen Fifteen\nHe teamed up with Google to create a

number of novels including everything is limited and I got a younger brother named Josh Josh who is a science writer who wrote a book called mood walking\nWith Weinstein and it's actually incredibly

said we weren't allowed to spend essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically\nCan get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things are good we make life much better\nAnd maybe in arguably make life much better so these technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle is an incredible invention in the ... and yeah and I found were incredible innovation and so I think we were right to marvel at them\nSo after rating for sleep for a while you moved on to the New Republic or as you call it the intellectual Oregon for hard nosed liberalism you ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nSo the New Republic with this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist Oregon and managed to protest over a hundred years while never really turning a profit and so as\nWe entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing to continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next and I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up resigning his editor\nBut then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard and co founder of Facebook\nAnd he bought the magazine and to me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media\nWho had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back and I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd their relationship in the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nYeah we became really good friends and it was exhilarating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and then maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris\nDecided that he'd always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we start chasing cliques in two thousand thirty in the ... way to get clicks was

master\nSocial media and this new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you're about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job was offering other people jobs at the New Republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of

defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all these races and she joins me now to break them down he just it up high Lula so\nCan Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors they haven't\nReally good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be a census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of got into really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they\nControlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen a good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it's a good sign for Democrats math is really for them what state are you watching\nHeading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of\nPickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa's it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor ... and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that are really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt um Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma\nWhy is that I mean what is driving that it's\nOf

expansion and terrorists is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans and how many of their income and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont still Scott are all favorites to win re election\nThey could flip the seat and Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could
