Jewish organization near Philadelphia has a program to talk about this and other difficult topics with teenagers\nNPR's Jeff Brady sat in with a group of young men\nIn the basement of a suburban Philadelphia home a half dozen high school freshmen boys are munching on chip and practice of thirty five year old group leader Cody greenest introduces the week's topic raise your hand if you've heard of the me too movement\nHe's a volunteer with moving traditions which organizes conversations like this with thousands of Jewish teens around the country\nGreenest leads a discussion about historical Howard differences between men and women and how that can play out when it\nComes to family do we believe that\nVerbal consensus necessary\nBut one of the voice David Letterman says it isn't always so simple he describes the situation on a bus where both people already said they're interested in each other and that girl purposely sits next to the boys\nAre and then she puts a blanket around you too and lays down and cut it yeah exactly and I cut us into like grabs your hands or you can hold hands and stuff like those are signs you know\nThe boys discuss several different situations and most seem to conclude that getting verbal consent is the best choice moving traditions founder and CEO Deborah Meier says the goal is to give teens this space to arrive at the right answer with their peers\nWe aren't telling them this is how you need to behave and this is how you don't behave and we don't shame them for who they are we help guys uncover the tenderness and that connection and the joined themselves as a human being and develop for themselves a sense of ethics and values and responsibility\nTalking about sexual assault in consent this way sounds different from

impossible\nLeave out any high anyway anti drunk driving\nDecades back most people were uncomfortable taking a friend's keys when they're too drunk to drive but after years of research and education

this kind of culture change is just getting started\nBut look around and you'll find examples one of the teenage boys meeting in the basement says that as a high school freshmen he's all ready to use the skills I have seen some stuff like a football game Matthew O'Donnell says he saw another guy touching a girl and trying to get into ... and\nHe wasn't sure it was a problem but just in case he made an excuse to separate them when I saw happening I was just kind of like\nA life to go to the bathroom\nIn the bathroom was like on the other side of stadiums so I said ... the guy went with him and the potential problem was averted\nSharon Potter the sociologist says that's a perfect example of identifying a situation and then intervening she says more of that along with praise for people like O'Donnell could lead to the culture change that results in fewer sexual assault in the future\nJeff Brady NPR News Philadelphia [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\nAnd the seven twenty nine will take
