Romero is here to tell us more so the name of this case is Ramos versus Nielsen Nielsen is here's the Nielsen the current head of the department of homeland security but for ... who is Ramos\nThat's great that I must she's an American citizen grew up in the Richmond area she goes to middle school and San Raphael and her mom came here from El Salvador she's had GPS for Seventeen years\nSo TPS temporary protected status which essentially allows people to stay and live and work here once a disaster\nOr war\nHas strict in the country that they would normally be returning to why is a U.S citizen involved in this case\nWell so since the Trump Administration decided to and TPS for nationals of El Salvador Haiti under us and Sudan\nPeople like Chris that you know us citizens and many of them children have to face this decision of do they go back with their parents or do they stay in the U.S without one or both of their parents\nIf she had to move I Would want to live with her but it's so hard because there's a lot of violence over there and there's not very good occasion like there is here 'cause here I Want to go to college go to high school\nWow and is her mom also a plaintiff in this case\nYes her name is Christina Murray outlets and she saw a plane death yeah they're basically saying that the Trump Administration unlawfully end at these protections motivated by racial discrimination by racial animus\nSo the judge in this case is Edward chin what his reaction been so far well\nHe says that there's some merit to that claim and then he decided to issue that preliminary injunction because he agrees that you know people like Chris ... would be harmed if TPS and\nI imagine for now Krista Ramos and her mom are\nHappy yeah this is good news for them and you know Christmas that's personally she used to be scared of talking in front of people before but she just knew that she had to be part of this lawsuit\n... thanks so much for continuing to cover this\nThink you're right [noise] it's time to check in with the team from very curious the folks who answered listener questions about the bay area\nThis question comes from Reed Williamson in Oakland he's pretty concerned about our housing prices and he thinks it's partly because bay area cities can't seem to work together on a regional fix Cupertino\nOdd jobs that apple and\nCupertino says will pass on housing is not our thing and then the next town over so that's not our thing either and all of a sudden you're all the way and\nTracy Reed thinks it's easy for cities like ... to ... to political pressure from citizens who don't want new housing built next to them you know nimby ism so he asks could we unite the bay into one city to solve our problems reporter Jessica project takes it from here\n[noise]\nSo what is the one hundred and one ... cities spread out over about seven thousand square miles United into one single city how could that help\nWhat is the city fundamentally do what is a city half the city has a mayor will have some authority over series of department\nThis is ... the regional planning director at spur a bay area civic organization\nYou would have won budget across this region\nAnd that budget is a beauty if the bay area where a country it has been nineteenth largest economy in the world just after the Netherlands and as one city we'd be able to spend all that money regionally\nYou would be thinking about where are the best places to grow in such a way we're really getting development around our transportation infrastructure so that people are going to drive as much\nThe transportation system would also be more seamless and connect people across a broader geography and there'd be a spreading out of resources so poor municipalities could provide services they might struggled to provide now however there are drawbacks to this one city thing to\nFall transit with merge together you might not have as much bus service in San Francisco as you do today because you would start spreading those resources across the bigger geography and so for people that are\nTrends are aligned in San Francisco they would see that as a loss and that's not all nothing's perfect and in a democratic context if you had a much larger city will be very different voting demographic\nThat people could elected mayor with more suburban sensibilities\nI Would point to Toronto as a city that kind of did that to a certain extent they expanded outward and had a much larger city and what you had at times as you would have a mayor who represented in much different perspective from the traditional urban core\nFurthermore third still be some kind of city council that might block projects on behalf of those local locals they represent must also be real here a hundred and one cities are very unlikely to give up control to a single governing body in the meantime something that we can do is collaborate better\nHow would it work if all the rail systems in the bay are really felt like one you don't have to merge um altogether but from a customer and got to feel like a merger\nTokyo does this with their many private rail companies but back to our housing problems so we do have regional institutions the problem is oftentimes their plans aren't binding or enforceable\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of

the east bound not can be directional them on past because of heating Joe McConnell for cutie\n\nAnd I will say that that like I said is quite around we are expecting some people including and you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator season Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we did it one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day you know exactly what will happen on that final which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural though today\nAnd David Greene his co hosting our coverage this morning he tells me I I you know I Wonder if you\nCould talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then these senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and then all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I Walk into the Capitol today there are a barricade had applications can not normal and that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I had seen president on from just about any voters any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints as the title isn't that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills a passing a sale date they aren't doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they don't talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting to the basics of government can't question is if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations counter out\nLet's turn to to ah or the college got Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington hey there Scott a David so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I I think I Am fine than is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't quite there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin boating\nAnd and one question I have gone into you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years correct somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nI remember I remember that I actually remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the Kavanaugh fight as a key reason a lot of Republican\nFeeling feeling or under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of that\nSexual assault even under the lowest standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case was even worse than that Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or failed to reach corroborate them\nFor the reasons this is all I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy their preponderance of evidence standard and the\nQuote so\nHave surly investigator judge Kavanaugh's background\nIn addition to the prior six FBI fall\nFeel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who are known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegations that were received are more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members\nThe FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there is nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation reports that we didn't already know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow through August excuse me now through October thirtieth and staff up red dot com good morning I'm Sandy ... filling in for a free man this is Kate key weedy public radio [noise]\nThat's gay kiwi DSM San Francisco and Kiki we I FM north highlands Sacramento\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steven Inskeep We are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there is for key votes this was going to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entirety over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the other senator we'll hear from\nIs the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote it was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's\nFirst nominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you'd call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking their set of doing that final cleanup hit for their sides at but don't be fooled by their\nBoring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nAnd you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their appointment\nBeen marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info sessions will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford ...\nOr some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the day is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults actual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot elevates so much of the Supreme Court has been accused of such crime\nNot been founded what what they're saying shifts if one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days we'll we'll don't talk about that a little bit more mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate\nMinority leader of sorting chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary the well was poisoned from the outset when President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest is a trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court the rock worse than\nWhen the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nJust guarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd forwarding norms of transparency and the fairness and finally the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty and Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely circumstance cry by the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay knowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could've moved this nominee two weeks ago one week ago Democrats had nothing no say and don't\nWhen it comes to who comes to the floor but in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats from moving forward when it comes to complaining about the leg\nTwo words never come\nRepublican friends lips\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote and smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction with his nomination in reality again and using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward a conscience did and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford and her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a mere campaign are they using doctor for the smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is too they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee\nWhen future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate conduct here let them look back on this chapter as a shameful culmination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America\nPeople who will stop at nothing to win trench in advantage on our nation's courts\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many years and a bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nAnd for what for whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh certainly a product of an elite education\nBut also someone with hard right\nHard to write conservative jurisprudence far far away from what average Americans believe why most Democrats oppose this nomination at the outset\nWhen we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified judge show our highest court\nNot any more about after all is the United States Senate will also be making a shape whether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent until proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack and the Senate ...\nAll those signed up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy an American flight\nOr will declare that our society cannot you must not will not shut the bar so low so\nProblem today is a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge\nSponsorship of the cake

disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announces the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare the nominees would pave the way to turn it\nHis audience\nCrowds of far left protestors still filling out in the blanks on they're picking sides that weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against him\nMore recently we've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nI'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with\nGreat confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightening innocent jokes\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh as fast most set in strike\nEarlier this week so stop and consider the snap shots\nThe absurdity\nThey've started the indignity this\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice this is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist and before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of this year I committed were racing to announce they've made up their minds are um are totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was about a clearer that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats or consider this nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called\nResistance until the final vote was called\nFor a few which there are parts played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat there were gross destruction to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside doctor first\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ...\n... women\nHustled the vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old pi boat but here's the problem the old players weren't working\nThe distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus\nOpinions\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character so is there a matter of president they owe taxes weren't working one going to get the job done the resistance\nDemanded more\nTry something new they said well we all know\nDemanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for truth\nThey're committed collected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently I asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI investigation\nBy any parents that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence not not\nWhat's producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh no corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry or from anywhere else\nNothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after all we sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they'd been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yeah again\nI Believe the latest story is not the whole investigation is invalid not listen to this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses\nLet me say that again the latest story as it the whole investigation is invalid because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses never mind that they didn't actually witness anytime they didn't want us any time\nIs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting\nBut are these thoughts can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare where there's lots of last minute drama if you know you're getting the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nVote absolutely and reducing the number of senators that there is that very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing and knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask you about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move for Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that for the magic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of a lifetime really\nOf campaigning for change the federal judiciary unless your social listen to a little bit more as they go through the rules are killers [noise]\nMister Kenny Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen\nMr Warner Okay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow\nWe're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is I Know um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their minds and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance vow the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator who we have assumed as a yes or have assumed doesn't know who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice age here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has yet to Delaware went and checked it to have a one like investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate\nHas only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves and they have been a ... guide it but in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nOr that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated\nOn the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats according to our polling as is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only at ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over until it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right Brett Kavanaugh\nOf Kevin that's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabin all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state this cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you were going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mansion in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate and test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis note is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex ... has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles in recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio\nIs now a Republican strategist on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program Hey Steve could be with it\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nAnd you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big delivered for our base that frankly you know I think was looking for something\nTo get on to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap is a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh on to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparent gain and enthusiasm right now we're on a months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out voters ... and that was a challenge for us going into the metro it's why the out of\nPower party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more apt up and the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to exceed\nJust sort of the nail on the Gulf and in terms of locking down for ... years yeah\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because there were probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually it was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWell I think the process is the process and end up while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee from\nA Republican perspective we wanted we want to have a a a another twenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there and definitely while character assassination continues\nAnd then yes I Do think part of it is the ... the political factor which is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee and others solid a judge on the Supreme Court that is a great\nDay and night Korean Air connected to Seventy four destinations in Asia Korean Air excellence and fight [noise]\nGay\nKiwi DSM San Francisco Kaye kiwi I asked him not Thailand's Sacramento it's eight o'clock\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate in the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this about the age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this was not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate I kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well good morning to you both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and a new you know I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about\nThe historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court the different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he can\nWell it was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick\nFrom his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man\nThat is being replaced and that will kill the court that was sort of like a balance for it sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the vote is five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred\nWish list of hardcore conservatives four fifty a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argued that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nBe down there to eat in this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly we're not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the last you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as deeply now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in it and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that I ...\nI push it that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a\nSo that a minority cannot block\nA action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska another one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to rip out to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes\nVoting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron open\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why should do that\nWell the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't and\nAt the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor she has not said that let's be she did not say that\nAnd and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks would be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option\nShe may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's on like she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules were different when that sort of thing what happened you'd get sixty votes for cloture and then maybe only fifty two votes to pass some and now you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote\nAnd win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with all of\nUs okay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was a no vote at least on cloture\nSusan Collins of Maine who was a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the fat free verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual\nEvidence make sure the mob prevail\nBut they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise in the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the side of the fall of\nThe Senate is not quite have the final say but they got to step closer today with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering that we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now more lately is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ...\nYou got it excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learn this news of the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that that should actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the\nUh she was in college a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know she might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know deserves of all I'm going to vote no but he just starts about that could be possible I think that's likely but possible [laughter]\nPossible I think that's likely but possible and the other person is Joe mansion who\nUh I think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a his vote today\nA to a vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now [noise] ah if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nI Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or reinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we're deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one\nOr plausibly although it's a long shot in both\nTaking place in San Francisco with you but when a center October sixteenth learn more that go to a meeting dot com and Amazon Prime video presenting the return of the man in the castle were America's history is under siege but the resistance rises to fight the world they want\nIs special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we have been listening\nIn the last little while to historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they\nThe same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one senator\nSusan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today\nPerhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual votes would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nThat the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote\nFor a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominees even before there were allegations of sexual assault and then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh has a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine years to vote in let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to your ear to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no us certainly shows you know the kinds of independence she shown over the years than somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate beat the odds of doing that anywhere or nearly impossible now allowed to Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because she's a very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profile in courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion or because of the politics of\nEither their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with Joe Manchin when we say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody representing the state well I mean that's one that I'm not a fix with and I mean that not at a Democrat ... pro democratic thing I mean that at\nSomebody who would do with their voting rights go against their base so when you think about\nUm what we what we have less though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor later when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with\nThe pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mansion\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an out I'd still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor\nBut protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake and an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted orange hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday and most listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\nMe [noise] [noise]\n\nThe explicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg has we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure that judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't at a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody deep promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way in which when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick Garland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell said Mitch McConnell said\nSaid we are not going to hold even hearing ended Mitch McConnell says ... editor said we're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody that President Obama nominates with just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never bat an eye led and and and Obama had thought he was doing a I'm a\nA reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is that you pick a lottery he picked a moderate liberal or a ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the O. J. were land whole months at that\n... that you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick\nGarland today a Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listen to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also a guy on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and\nEvery debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick as your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen but when you're on\nAnswers that I've just had which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take a moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and ... and so now that the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war\nEvery time which is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now depends on what what are beginning point you want to want the set for when the story started to go wrong\nYes there are some similarities here and for Republicans the years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Supreme Court and out as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time they had just one of the year before they had one it's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they had lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan landslide and that was significant because they were winning and the south\nWith black voters they were winning with African American votes and Teddy Kennedy made the case and other senators made the case that those southern Democrats really owed those black voters a long hard look at whoever was next going on the Supreme Court all along comes Robert Bork who is willing to quite freely admit he had\nHighly conservative views remarkably eye opening eye popping views on some of the oldest Supreme Court precedents\nAnd the Democrats were appalled in the hearings he was somewhat combative himself in the hearings not to not like Brett Kavanaugh was last Thursday but he was certainly pushing back on all of the assertions that were made about him\nSunny skies around the bay high temperatures ranging from the mid sixties at the coast to the upper seventies inland\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United states senators voted fifty one to forty nine to advance\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected tomorrow there was a handful of votes that we work closely watching about four senators\nWhose votes runs certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Republican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kevin all or at least to devote no against uh on on uh on on the debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes\nUh put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there is at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote when the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but you give a final\nAnswer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's the medical ... is still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what what evidence do we have to go on to the way she's leaving well\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching this court at you know the final four voters a and there is a possibility that people vote differently\nFor cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins is she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of Betsy device for education secretary in fact\nShe wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote she voted differently in the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the ... tensions [laughter] there's your health good yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but send that she still had concerns about how ... how much she would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against\nA colon and for or against 'em to Boston and wound up forcing a Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney has it come down and break the tie on a package of tax\nJust a reminder that the vote today as a vote for continuing process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and you may choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christine ... executive vice president for policy at the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ms ...\nCome on and so what are you thinking about this for a\nWhile I'm thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's\nBipartisan opposition to even proceeding are ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct and I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw\nSerious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nIt's yeah it's it's not correct to say there was no evidence because there is the evidence of someone sworn testimony and considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republican outta fifty one who voted no uh this has been a very very partisan vote and that is equally partisan on the Democratic side is not\nWell I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nI usually people I Want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote it sends a really strong signal about how troubled she\nOur highest court so I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote but I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's\nProcedural vote is just the preview for ah the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled\nI don't need a told them ...\nYou know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular are ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine lousy four letter ... early July\nI'm and ... you you were a senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which ... shift both so hot\nAt you and and Dianne Feinstein and said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone\n... it was there a better way for the Democrats too have handled it really list ... now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein has ranking member handled that says she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public\nAnd I think Senator Feinstein honored her wishes\nAnd I think that's admirable\nBut other people think it is less admirable but ... you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein show that she really understands what the whole me to movement is about which is\nWhen you are survivor ... sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story\n... I'm thinking about that was it impossible for her to tip off the FBI to mention it to someone and then it can be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there's ... interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island ah to the chairman staff and the chairman staff relieve the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could\n... you know share it with other members and still preserved confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as I don't know if I'd say I'm really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticized\nAnd I suppose we should mention the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or stuff has been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmakers who uh had possession of the letter we don't know who\nElse might have been told and and what we're both in the end ... leaked do you believe ... Santa ...\nWas barren option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been uncorroborated I'm Better at an individual didn't want to go on the record\n[noise] well I I don't know who leaked it but I think that\nWhat this experience has shown and many senators have been confronted with this over the past week is there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories ... sexual assault who will never tell anyone or who will suddenly can fast with senator they're interrupting in in an elevator\nI think with this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women have experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason if they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good and I'm I'm really worried that\n... before the treatment and president ... mocking her to laughter and ... campaign rally ... exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere that they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nLet me ask you about one thing along those lines are ... our caller David Greene spoke earlier today with Julia you off and she's with journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article about touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teens\nBut said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to take seriously investigate these kinds of allegations of difference between the broad issue and the specific question of whether a specific individual can be proved guilty through some neutral process here\nHas there been some confusion of one ... the other on this issue people who were concerned about the broader issue have assumed that Kevin all must be guilty because they're concerned about the issue or the reverse for that matter\nWell first they would say this is not about his guilt or not kill this is a job interview\nAnd Republicans prevented any corroborate ing or supporting witnesses from being hurt by the committee and then Republicans prevented the FBI from reaching out to people who would support Christine lousy for the count or Debbie ... account", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "05"}
