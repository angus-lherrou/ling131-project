studios between Nineteen fifty six\nAnd Nineteen sixty four that's the period just before communist leader Fidel Castro nationalize the recording industry and since then these albums have become extremely hard to come by\nUntil now that is that that is called the complete Cuban jam sessions volumes one through five and here to talk about it is Felix Contreras host of NPR's all Latino podcast

states\nSo the owners of the studio were concerned about what was going to happen with the masters of what was going to happen to the style of music so they started taking these masters and smuggling them out of the country and depositing them in different Latin American countries along the way so what happened to those recordings over the years in hiding\nEventually they were sold at different labels and Latin America over the years\nSome shoddy reproductions were produced along the way but most of the albums became incredibly hard to find\nSo finally a couple of years ago California label
