small in number but we are prominent whether Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in law or a Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win any as a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments of hatred and in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan

Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast explains\nMany people in China don't have bank accounts don't really have much of a credit history so China has never created something quite like the American credit score\nAnd so there is for lack of a better way to trust deficit in China that is impacting economic activity\nRachel Hoffman teaches trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust she says a lack of trust in people and businesses has how China's economy back\nSo in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them and you know who has lots of data on how people behave companies especially big companies like Ali Baba that is China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country\nAnd has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit so the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit for\nThe way people that school is not seem to do and they miss it they could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy not ease your responsible so your school will go out but if you buy video games you lazy see a school will go down\nBut it's a credit score will not be all about what you by the

twenty\nBut we got a glimpse into how it might work because China is testing out versions of it in pilots cities across the country\nWe talked to a thirty two year old IT engineer named Huron John he

if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful enormously\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person gets paid by Soros or somebody\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her fired use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another ... bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a bias Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere this modest for\nTalking about they talk about the early do you ever see the elite\nHer says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews getting nervous\nThat danger for the Jew it that we are very small in number but we are prominent Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win\nAny as a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentment of hatred and in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind anyway\nIt's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitic or\nWhatever the reason that does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take

Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't jak holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting a model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stories may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercial space is CEO Mohammed ... says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich also push coming from ... regret and we walked in the past ... on that and we've seen a lot of
