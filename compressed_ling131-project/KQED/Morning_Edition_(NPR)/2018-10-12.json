can let me bring her in cooking Hi David okay so the first question is coming from a guy named ... he goes by that name he's in India he tweets at tribute projects and he asked this\nHow do current president's rallies compare in terms of the estimated number of attendees\nDissimilar appearances by past presidents\nAre cookies so how did how did the Trump rallies compare but\nLet's just stipulate Donald Trump has enormous rallies and sometimes they're also hundreds sometimes thousands outside trying to get in\nBut it's hard to do a direct comparison because we don't really know how many people showed up and early rallies I can tell you that John F. Kennedy had enormous crowds in Nineteen sixty he was constantly straining to fire codes\nOr the night before the election he was at the Boston Garden weigh twenty two thousand people were estimated to be there I was actually there David and it was terrifying it was so many believe him while I'm but also keep in mind that in early history\nIt was considered unseemly for presidents or presidential candidates to campaign though they did it through surrogates a course which is pretty much what Trump is doing for Republican candidates this year\nWhere there was a time when candidates didn't want to campaign I Know when it doesn't sound restful in real but [laughter] Andrew\nJohnson when he was president did go out on the campaign trail in Eighteen sixty six campaign against the Republicans in Congress that he thought a way to radical it was called his swing around the circle it backfired totally um\nIt didn't help that he often appeared to be drunk and sometimes fell off the platform of growing up but it's also true that much of the public and press I thought it was just undignified for the president to engage in that campaign\nWell then the next question comes from someone who uses the Twitter name way to hear this give me a freaking break above that so give me a freaking brand you know what I was there ever a time when money wasn't an issue it sounds ... but I'm hoping history has a positive example of where\nIt wasn't that the question so with money ever not so involved\nI hate to disappoint give me African break but um basically money's been there since the beginning or we talked recently on one of these talks about how George Washington had wind and dined voters when he was running for the Virginia house of ... and it caused that body to pass the nation's first
