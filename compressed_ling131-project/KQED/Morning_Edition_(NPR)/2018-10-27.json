if things aren't going right in our democracy we stand up in a civil and peaceful way hopefully in a respectful way\nAnd we give our voices and in criticism and so if I could translate Donald Trump at the United nations two weeks ago I think what he really is he's practicing nationalism\nNot patriotism\nAnd nationalism um it can be appropriate it also can be perverse it couldn't be\nBetter than you are we're better than anybody else um\nAnd to me America First or the way she's articulate it and the way he's practice it as a very negative force in our society ... it pushes people away\nAnd in a time of real integration in the world where our economy is integrated around the world where the biggest problems I think that our kids especially are going to face when we hand off the baton and

across our borders building codes\nThat require us to be working across our borders building coalitions and you know when I worked for the two Bush is President George H W and President George W or

Japan et cetera\nMove forward without us yeah at ... followed it as how were the ones that out in the south China is not ... was that a move that that turned out to be in our interest\nNo of course not I mean I think that the the Trans Pacific partnership forty percent of global GDP in the countries that were had already signed up to the twelfth countries as as you said um that was our big power moves against China because China has been manipulating its currency\nNot playing on a level playing field on trade\nViolating its commitments in another world Trade Organization China needed to be held to account for that\nThe way to do it was to get the countries of our hemisphere and if you just think about our hemisphere is Canada the United states and Mexico and Peru in Colombia and she lives very much western hemisphere with some of the big countries in Asia Japan\nA that was that was our moved to force China to conform to to play fair and abide by the rules and when the president pulled us out it gave China major break the Chinese couldn't believe that they\nReceived this gift in the first week of the administration so I think that the president's notion that he rejects all multilateral trade agreements\nAnd they've lifted a lot of boats over the last forty or fifty years they've not only made us prosperous they made lots of other countries prosperous [noise] um I think it was a mistake [noise]\nUm the idea that you could take apart NAFTA we need to modernize NAFTA NAFTA was the world of Nineteen Ninety three Ninety four so I Do get modernizing NAFTA I I thought the way he did it was unnecessarily pure journalistic with Canada especially but also with Mexico [noise] let me say something in his defense however\nHe's right to go after the Chinese and to stand up to them and what I've noticed just traveling I was in I think I've been seven European countries in the last couple of months\nUm is the Europeans are quietly cheering on Donald Trump and many of the Asian countries are in taking on China I I this this trade war is is is a little bit tricky\nYou don't want to take it so far into the future and and and they don't want the numbers to add up so much that it begins to hurt our economy but I think making the point to the Chinese buffet have to be accountable and they have to adhere to rules is a good one and I think Donald Trump has a lot of the world behind him now that he is fixed ...\nOf of sorts we can't call it NAFTA anymore\nThe U.S Canada Mexico or U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement [noise] he's made up with the European Union we don't have a fix right now with the European Union but we've agreed on a non aggression packed with him on trade\nAnd he's made up with a Japanese and South Koreans so he's kind of cleared the decks and I think that's the right thing for him to do\nUm we have to defend ourselves on trade a lot of Americans have lost jobs in key parts of our country because the Chinese have not been fair and and I do think he's the presence right to do this\nSo we're now in a sellout trade war with China yeah um\nAnd and I think the question is would this imposition of terrorists uh our American consumers heard we heard in our own economy or is that reaction to a ... a on a sandwich and to us as well as to them\nWas the question that some industries some parts of the farm belt are going to be hurt by a prolonged trade war with China you have to calculate if you're the U.S trade representative Robert Lighthizer is a very smart guy or certainly the president's got to calculate how far do you take it\nI don't think the Chinese they're so self confident now and she's been paying has so much riding on his own economic agenda he's not going to case\nSo the end of this is going to be some kind of a win win solution hopefully after the Chinese have made commitments to us and to the rest of the world that would repair some of their very injurious trade practices I'm someone who does not want to make China into an enemy\nAnd I think there's a lot we have to we need to do with China as partners as well as competitors and we're both with China [noise]\nBut I Do agree on trade at the time has come to stand up to\n... s partners it I think Korea is a great example of the ... the Chinese yeah very ... so on and I I guess I'm part of me wants to ask you in fact I Will ask you [laughter]\nUm where do we pick the right battle but maybe at the wrong time because we need that Chinese for much right now\nSo it's interesting I'm going to praise Donald Trump again\n[noise] I you know you got to be fair and I've been a critic of his I mean to be clear to everybody I worked in the Hillary Clinton campaign I very much hope she was going to be president didn't happen\nUm I think the ... I think President Trump has made a mistake after mistake but here's a ... I'm Glad that he turned towards diplomacy I was worried a year ago today\nThat the Trump and Kim Jong on rhetoric\nBut it shipped to the cake you eat the live stream Cindy from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with a steady on demand\nBy all the fall of the Soviet Union prudent infamously I thinks that the greatest catastrophe the twentieth century it was a fall of the Soviet Union most of us would say the greatest triumph\nOr one of them of the twentieth century and foreign policy was the fall of the Soviet Union but they feel humiliated by it they were one of the two strongest powers in the world they're clearly not now China is\nIn every metric of power economic political soft power military power China is vastly superior they've passed the Russians\nThe Russia's GDP is about what Spain's GDP is this is not a super power except for the dimension of space and nuclear weapons they feel humiliated by that loss and I think it does drive by shooting you know why did he go into Syria during the refugee crisis of the art of two thousand Fifteen three years ago it really wasn't\nTo advance all of Russia's interest they wanted to retain their naval base there\nI think it was to cut the U.S down to size show that the U.S President Obama hesitated\nHe hesitated big time in Syria he couldn't quite make up his mind what he wanted to do in pollutants our weakness\nAnd decided I Want to take advantage I'm going to humiliate the United states\nWhich in many ways is what he's done he's become the king pin Syria we are falling from grace we no longer have that influence that all of our presidents had from really Richard Nixon to the second term uh Brock Obama President Obama for a lot of reasons and we can argue whether he was right or not I think he was probably wrong\nDecided that the lesson he learned from our ill fated in interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan don't enter the middle east but we twelve million homeless people twelve million homeless out of a population of twenty two point four million in Syria [noise] ah it's been a catastrophe and\nSyria has been a catastrophe and I'm not saying we should have put a hundred thousand American troops in but could we put\nCould we have set up I'm safe zones on the Jordanian and Turkish borders at least protected some of the refugees we could have done this militarily without exposing our soldiers to too much harm it would have been risky in many ways [noise]\nUm and so potent took advantage of that and I think that was part of the calculation that he can't really compete with us but he wants to block us and he wants to diminish us as part of his calculation\n[noise] um he had had an experience with us in in a in a case of um of Libya where at and they\nGet was a situation where there was a civil war\nQuestion is do we intervene and we chose to intervene in that case and and and the nation changed by fast yeah from a responsibility to protect\nInnocent civilian the innocent civilians to regime change yeah that was on the face and I'm just positive that she can tell me I'm wrong for Russia an ally of the act of let that happen\nHad it happened again in Syria had when we entered and found for regime change our had at the Russians kind of given us a green light to take action wouldn't credibility as an ally I'd be gone to an around\nYeah so that you remember that the intervention in Libya and two thousand eleven was actually authorized by the United Nations Security council Russia held was NATO Rochelle vetoes NATO operation the Russians decided not to veto because we had made the argument the United states France and Britain\nThat there were thousands of civilians that could be massacred by Gadhafi in Benghazi and at the United nations had to um NATO had to go in and blessed by the un to protect them that was the mission\nAnd we accomplish that mission we prevented a humanitarian disaster in that first phase of Libya operation but then when NATO got in NATO essentially decided and mainly led by the Europeans by the way this was not President Obama he wanted prime minister Cameron in President Sarkozy to lead they did they wanted to go after Gadhafi\nAnd destroy his regime and and the Russians felt betrayed that they felt that they had failed and they decided not to block this mission because it was ... and they didn't know it would be regime change and so um I think the Russians probably have a point there it's a minor debating point in my view but they have a point\nYou want to get to the larger question whether we are right to expand NATO thank you I\nLong story really annoyed at a time when they were doing a\nRussia policy you I'm\nIn and the national Security Council and did it turn out to be the right choice\nI think it did I I worked for President George W. Bush Condi Rice and I were the two person Soviet team in the last two years of the Cold War\nSo I was actually on December twenty fifth Nineteen Ninety One Christmas Day\nWas the note taker on the phone from my home in Virginia in ... when President Bush wish Gorbachev farewell saw the end of the Soviet Union and masterful masterful work of President Bush and secretary James Baker\nI mean I think two of the finest public servants I ever worked for I admire both of them so much they were able to\nConvince Gorbachev to end the Cold War peacefully they were able to engineer the unification of Germany without a shot being fired how many people would have bet on that\nDay the wall came down and developer nine thirty nine and did that within ten months of the wall coming down\nI'm I'm just in Berlin last week our daughter and one of our daughters lives in Berlin um you know went to the Brandenburg Gate as as well pass the time now but it's still dramatic to think about what happened they were so skillful in handling Gorbachev President Bush and President Clinton I work for him for two years in that same job where so skillful\nIn trying to make Russia and or a partner of the United states and for a number of years you know we didn't plan on expanding NATO we thought we could live with Russia as a partner we thought Russia had a chance to become a democratic country Russia was a democratic country\nFrom Nineteen Ninety ... Ninety One until maybe Ninety six Ninety seven but that democracy melted\nAnd the economy imploded and all the people on fixed incomes ended up living in poverty\nA and corruption set in and a lot of the advice that we gave them we'll take some responsibility for this you know how do you transition from a command economy to a market economy when we went we said shock therapy well about thirty Russians got fabulously wealthy they turn out to be the ... sharks\nAnd all that most Russians suffered and by the by Ninety six Ninety seven Ninety eight we concluded in the Clinton Administration that Russian democracy was failing on his was going to fail there was a big strategic vacuum in central Europe all the countries that have been part of the Warsaw Pact\nPoland and the Czech Republic and Slovakia and hungry and Slovenia and Romania and Bulgaria and particularly the three Baltic states a stony Alaskan Lithuania that have been forcibly incorporate it for fifty years into the Soviet Union they were not part of any block\nThey were not part of NATO or the European Union and we feared that if an authoritarian leader came back in Moscow and he came back in Nineteen Ninety nine named Vladimir ... and ... that person would click with quickly want to consolidate control of the east of Eastern Europe\nAnd a lot of us felt I was not alive\nIn the spring of Nineteen forty five when an ailing FDR and Churchill\nMade this cruel deal with Stalin that he would effectively control Yalta Eastern Europe we were in power\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream thanks Sandy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home life by for ultimately has been the home to redeem that\n[noise] nature compromise that FDR in church will made at the end of the second World War\nAnd these people about a hundred and Fifteen million people in all these countries could become free forever and all of them joined the EU and all of them join NATO and I'm so happy to this day that we expanded NATO up to the Russian border because if we hadn't putting would be in stony and laugh yet today\nAnd he'd be an aggressor in Eastern Europe and we'd be back to where we were at the end the second World War\nAnd I think what you you hear 'em they've clearly is in the defense of extending expanding NATO to include a central Europe\nUm and and the argument that was the right to say yeah yeah [noise] what is where some folks fall away is stopping at the Russian border and I know we had the partnership for peace but their argument is look at what we did after World War two with Germany\nI'm rather than isolate defeated nation in fact you you you put it in the midst of um as a larger international order in which we have more in common than in conflict\nYou know we felt a principal I ... and it's interesting who's president I'm Bill Clinton President George W. Bush and President Obama all agreed on this strategy they all expanded NATO\nAnd they all supported the expansion of the European Union this took place or you know it just took pays over a Fifteen year period it went in three different stages and the principles that guided all three of those presidents when I work for a tour of President Clinton and President George W. Bush and I was an advisor in the\nObama administration to Secretary Kerry was we wanted to see a Europe where every European country would decide its own future and not have because they were small their future decided by\nA hostile power to their east Russia and and and the Russians from the Roman off to the Soviet general secretary to boot and they've won and strategic what they call strategic depth and if we brought our map\nAnd and she is Chancellor Merkel is the leading small D democratic standing up for human rights and democracy what we believe in and our presidents trying to under cutter it is absolutely it's outrageous than American presidents during this dream we go all the way back\nTo every president we've worked for Jimmy Carter as where I started none of our presidents\nThat the cardinal rule was we're gonna disagree with our allies in private that was Ronald Reagan's rule that was Richard Nixon's for all that was George W Bush's real just name three Republicans\nAnd and President Trump through as I'm going to be extremely offensive to our best friends and I'm going to suck up and embrace our enemies I don't get it\nAnd it and it's not right and the Europeans are watching this and they were appalled by it and I'm appalled as an American\nCitizen that he does seem to think that the the smartest strategy with an autocrat is to fly to them that he has to have a point at all\nNo [laughter] I think if you talk to them I mean I Wish we could have George Shultz here who lives in this great city\nNinety seven year old George Schultz who there's an amazing person I think I don't want to put words in his mouth but I I've learned from him I've learned for secretary Baker I've learned from ... to rise I've learned from Madeleine Albright Hillary Clinton Colin Powell all of our great secretaries of state I think we're all of them would say is\nOf course you want to establish a relationship even with an autocratic leader in a negotiation but we need to be tough and clear with those leaders we you know being nice of them is not going to work\nSo so\nLet me take his you know keep keep on our relationship with Europe right now um [noise]\nThat's you know based on a set of norms based on a set of institutions all of which we veils and advanced because they\nAdvance to our economic and security interest restless as there is um\nWe we've always been a viable partner are rarely interests are always taken into account on the understanding that there as well as well right now as you look at that last set of relationships and that with with your with your candidate on trade with and with Europe it as an as an ACL any you\nUm are they trying to figure out\nHow to work with President Trump and they're very changed as I Am at are they not trying to figure out okay how do we work without President Trump how do we work I shouldn't have hasn't from how do we work with the United states as a major ally in a major force [noise]\nI think most of these European countries are allies including Japan and South Korea this trail you most of them are trying to work with secretary palm pale and Secretary Mattis\nUm you know we're going to have a Seventy eighth anniversary of NATO on April for two thousand Nineteen and NATO's not going to have a summit meeting\nBecause and here's why they won't say this but I Know it's because they have no idea what President Trump would say he might decide the alliance and you know and all of our presidents have held the summits at NATO every single one of our presidents and on the fiftieth and sixtieth anniversary we had some is in Washington\nCan't trust the president so I think most of the government's trying to work at the cabinet level there's deep respect for Madison ... around the world [noise] um there was deep respect for general McMaster as well I think there's a lot of respect for Vassar Nikki Haley who's announce yesterday she is stepping down\nUm you know so I didn't mention John Bolton ah because I don't think there is a kind of respect for John Bolton um and so this is a problem for us in some on some issues climate change\nI think the Europeans the Japanese are trying to work with your great governor here\nAnd when Michael Bloomberg and with American NGOs and with our governor Charlie Baker Republican in Massachusetts He's for doing something about climate change and Governor Brown is of course yeah you're a great governor assignment governor Jerry Brown so um they see the power of California frankly your state\nWould you be the fifth or sixth largest economy if your sex and it's extraordinary thing\nAnd they see that at the grassroots level the great majority of Americans agree with the science of the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change [noise] agree that we have to be part of the solution agree that we can't opt out there are a hundred and Ninety five nation states in the un there are a hundred and Ninety four say good choice of the Paris Agreement one country\nThe second largest carbon emitters out so I think what's gonna happen whenever President Trump believes office whether it's twenty twenty or twenty twenty four or you know whatever whether whether he resigns\nI think the government's will come back quickly the other governments to work with his successor 'cause I'll have no alternative given our power in the world I just wonder about average people in Germany or Japan\nUm and they look at us as this extremely wealthy country who's saying that the rest of the message to the rest of the world from us is on climate change sorry you're on your own we're just going to put money into call and we're just gonna keep burning coal\nAnd that is offensive to a lot of people in Europe as in Germany last week and I as I told you the number one issue for most German citizens when they look out the world is climate change\nMaybe the number one issue for most Americans in the polls is terrorism for climate and we've sent him a pretty tough signal I don't think that comes back and in both issues we need one another we do and if you look at the if you haven't read the Pew poll and the Chicago Council Paul's they both came out last week they're extraordinary pulse\nSponsorship the cake you eat the live stream thanks Sandy from ... ... than it Internet delivers in home life by for ultimately has been the home\nIt the American people at Seventy six percent believe in NATO the American people believe in trade\nThe American people believe in immigration and refugee is because we're an immigrant nation they believe that we should be standing up for a democracy everything that President Trump hasn't done it's almost been a reaction in the American polls against what he said\nAnd the public opinion polls overseas we are at our lowest point in recorded history\nOn the credibility of the United states and in Germany more people trust potent than trust Trump and Germany's an allied nation so we're in a deep hole in terms of our credibility\nThere's another issue beyond climate and others we've talked about and that's their on\nTheir age yet the nuclear deal as a multilateral deal I European allies for a a part of it\nNot only did we withdraw from the nuclear deal but we are exercising our rights as secondary sanctions first describe what secondary sanctions are I don't know if they if they are new with that deal or they exist in other claimants I'm playing out\nRight yeah so I mean as Jane knows I was George W. Bush and Condi Rice's around negotiator or we didn't get to the negotiating table we mainly sanction the Iranians are when President Obama and and our good friend Wendy Sherman who was a real heroin here\nWe're able to negotiate the Iran nuclear agreement of two thousand Fifteen I very much supported them I testified before Congress I'm supporting President Obama I thought I didn't think it was a\nI didn't think it was a slam dunk there are a lot of things about the deal that bothered me but like any do you have to kind of way the positive negative I thought it was kind of a sixty forty fifty five forty five in favor but I saw the downside [noise]\nUm but what what's that deal did was they were ... to a nuclear weapon through uranium enrichment and through Tony and processing\nWe force the Iranians to dismantle the industrial process sees that they had set up and we could be absolutely sure that for Fifteen to Twenty years into the future passed two thousand Fifteen they were not going to be able to build a nuclear weapon for me that was good enough\n'cause you know you had to assume that the country might change their country not so much regime change just change between now and then in twenty thirty so I thought it was a mistake for President Trump to get out because um he's not replacing it with anything\nAnd if he drives around into a corner they may go back illegally to try to develop a nuclear weapon then we're going to be back into the choice of whether we fight them or go back to negotiate we've already in Goshen in a pretty good\nAnd is it illegal for them to cut and they simply say look the U.S pulled out it's no longer viable deal\nWell under international under us sanctions have been ...\nUnder the nonproliferation agreement of ah Nineteen sixty eight\nIs illegal for any countries are developed nuclear weapons outside the five countries the permanent members of Security Council United States the United kingdom France\nThen the Soviet Union a and China it's illegal for anybody to have nuclear weapons and and that we should honor that treaty and we shouldn't want to do anything that would allow countries to try to head down that road secondary sanctions so not only did we leave the Iran agreement in April of two thousand this year\nWhich I thought was a mistake but I'm I don't I didn't get a vote on this one I'm the president decided who imposed secondary sanctions on our allies\nWho negotiated in good faith with us over ten years\nBecause it was the Bush and Obama administrations that negotiated with Britain France and Germany over ten years\nAnd secretary sanctions main any European company\nThat wishes to trade with Iran and existing contracts which is legal\nAfter the Iran nuclear deal or Fifteen would then be submitted subjected to the United nation United States sanctions laughter any company Deutsche Bank the French oil company ... any company would have to choose do I want to be in the Iranian market called the American market\n\nSnap judgment comes up at one o'clock and then again at eleven PM here and kick you in the public radio ... and weekend edition and snack\nOn ...

much for being with us great to be with you Scott and let's begin to the crown prince is it possible he would lose power over the ... affair\nThe other four different options one is that he stays in power that the international furor eventually settled down and he managed to\nKind of orchestrate his ability to stay on the throne um he is a de facto leader in Saudi Arabia because his father is age to nailing the second scenario is that he is replaces crown prince\nAnd there is precedent for that are over the last three years to other crown princes have\nBeen pushed aside in part to make room

can EDITION from NPR News I'm Scott Simon last week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew bitten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem street and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency interested in whether it football players took a knee or not during the play into the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets had gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University\nWho helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation ...\n... so it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the clubs and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years is not a lot of time if you're say Betty White\nYou know what the gift for twentieth anniversary is drier Lynch\nAnd we have a

what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff and focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly [noise]\nYou've had so many um famous gas\nLead bring the silly [noise] you've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States to two presidents have yeah we have the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared post presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings\nAnd I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah um how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had some great partners I haven't I've been blessed and I have stood on the

edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon negative campaign ads have become just about as much a part of the season is pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael Franz who teaches\nPolitical science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ad these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pet\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in midterm campaigns\nFor younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter suggest the season aren't you\n[laughter] uh you know there there there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or were attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and in question should be raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who's co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us in how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow morning by

watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched um\n[noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was absolutely riveting and em stunning Eighteen picture\nIt was a absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight [laughter] well the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game red\nSox manager Alex ... still hadn't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes nascent you've all the Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer regattas eight dealer dealers [laughter] my God he was a brilliant\nThis was two games you know literally was tonight in game and for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no teams ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic heat during the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker Mueller being the start\nAnd then I does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win\n... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game LA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into games for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing

I Would go according to reports usually arrived there is it possible someone told him posed with the prince and you can get out and\nAbsolutely uh there's no question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile and there had to be a lot of behind the scene maneuvering including a request specifically\nBy the United states and secretary of

edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon\nLast week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew bitten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem was beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency interested in whether it football players took a near not during the playing of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you were dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets had begun all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nSo it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate [noise]\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed correct\nYes so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in Andrew\nBeaten up the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years is not a lot of time if you're say Betty White you know what the gift for twentieth anniversary it's drier Lynch and we have a

or handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff in focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly [noise]\nYou've had so many um famous gas and sort of course of a president the United states to two presidents of the yeah we had the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was a Bill Clinton who appeared post presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job in the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside my job is\nIf there is one to make them appear to be human beings\nAnd I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being\nI Love bill Curtis yeah um how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell we all you've had some great partners\nI haven't I've been blessed and I

couple of years ago\nThere is a democratic incumbent Senator Sherrod brown was a big lead in the polls Democrats have a good chance to take back the governor's mansion\nGears a grassroots campaign by union they are still some marketing from the fact that Donald Trump won among traditionally democratic union households in the state NPR's Don Gonyea reports from Lorraine Ohio\nTwenty sixteen was an election Ohio labor activists would just as soon forget Democrats gone on a big boost from the votes of labor households but Donald Trump with is talk of killing the north American free trade

are now losing faith in the president's but they'll also say they know there are union members still cheering the president on I also talked to a few such pro Trump union voters who didn't want to speak on the record\nThen there are voters like sixty six year old Rita bowling a registered nurse she was voting early and Lorraine county yesterday she was a reluctant union member and doesn't take union advice on politics even so ... who says she has cast\nBallots for Democrats and Republicans says this about her vote in twenty eight days this year I didn't really\nWant to devote all

areas\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon negative campaign ads have become just about as much a part of the season is pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael Franz who teaches\nPolitical science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negatives but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pet the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season aren't you\n[laughter] uh you know there there there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition\nIn ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric and public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization and the only thing I'll say it has a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertise\nLeast campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure and Tamara weekend edition Sunday literally looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR\nOr your station by name\n[noise]\nAnd it's time for sports [noise]\nThe art of negative ads by the time I really began to get up for work there the longest Damon World Series history was still going on at\nEighteen innings seven twenty minutes longer than the playing time of the entire Nineteen thirty nine World Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to ... by max Muncie\nIn the bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there man are you there your weight yeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game unbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched\nUm [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton courage arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter it isn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight [laughter] well the Dodgers have\nNamed starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still hadn't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer we got a dealer dealers [laughter] my God he was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight in game\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no teams ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would've been just kind of a normal when with Walker Mueller being the start\nOf the night does not LA and not have anything left in the tank to win ...\nThat's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but\nThose teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun\nTom Goldman thanks so much You're welcome the deal Bob Cousy and bill Russell was one of the greatest they were\nTo Tracy and Hepburn the rocky and
