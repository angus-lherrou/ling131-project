into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi so so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all over the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey ... the restoration of national pride I don't think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insists the survival of democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out parts of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects to judge how\nTo remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's the central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader whose confident in on corrupt\nFor example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as home Andrea\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe this I think he really puts dye\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ...\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando chip powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are

an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil or almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they get in for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the cars on the candidate financial the dashing so comprehensively\nI should say does that both of them self insists the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court said an off duty read out parts of the constitution to report is about the need for the future presidents

more leeway to use even more lethal force and they ... they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high moody right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also

call lick with action\nIf a significant seismic event or to occur\nThe solid ground which start to behave more like jello and spread and so one of the risks to the wall is that it could spread at

rising tide could cost up to five billion dollars\nPort officials say they don't exactly know how they'll do that [noise]\nBut they argue that the protection offered by the seawall now is vital and the clock is ticking on its future I'm Molly Peterson cake you read the news [noise]\nWater is also on the ballot for the rest of the state with props three and eight point nine billion dollar water bond and it's created some division you might not expect some environmental groups are for it but some are against\nJoining me now to explain that is cake you eat a science reporter Lauren Sommer hey Lauren Hi so what exactly is in this water bond and what will it paid for\nOkay so this bond is it you know those big packs of Halloween candy we see right now where there's just all the kinds of mixed in there that's exactly what this water bond it's just a huge grab bag of water projects you got more than two billion dollars to restore watersheds places like Lake Tahoe in San Francisco bay\nSome of that money would actually go to improving forest which could also reduce fire risk\nTheir money in there to help communities that don't have safe drinking water right now to help them clean it up\nAnd there's money in there for water recycling and water conservation just a whole host of other things so a huge mix\nSo that sounds like a lot of things that uh environmental groups would like why are some against it well what's\nYour least favorite Halloween candy definitely candy corn okay so for some groups this water bond has some candy corn mixed in this big bag of Halloween candy they are not a fan of it um it has to do with this big canal and the Central Valley called the Frank current can now it delivers water to farmers that grow our food\nThe problem is that the farmers there have really pumped a lot of ground water out of the ground and so much so that the land there is thinking and that's and damaging this big can now\nSo some of the money in this water bond would go to fixing the canal and groups like the Sierra Club don't like that they don't want to see states taxpayer money go to federally owned projects like this canal\nOkay but didn't California voters just pass a big water bond\nYes yeah and twenty fourteen we pass prop one which was a seven point five billion dollar water bond that we are currently spending right now that's kinda how we tend to fund water infrastructure into Steve is with these big bonds\nUm but that bond prop one was put on the ballot by the state legislature this bond props three was put on by special interests and a little bit more pay to play\nAnd so that's been a big criticism of it is that it doesn't quite have the oversight that some of the other water bonds have had one last question will this grab bag of water projects be half off after Halloween but that would be quite a deal I don't think so though\nAll right thank you are and that was cake you read science reporter Lauren summer I

about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all over the

them to a dashing so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insists the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court mounted an off duty read out parts of the constitution to reporters about\nThe need for

any races and I don't believe this I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that he had a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they ... they were ready people here David are sick of robberies and the sky high moody right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns

dollar bond to begin repairs and upgrade the century old waterfront kicking weedy science reporter Molly Peterson has the story [noise]\nThe Embarcadero is like San Francisco's front yard crowded with tourists to skate boarders and busy workers at new\nBut the ports resilience director Lindy alone has a hundred and sixty years ago during the gold rush the natural short was nearly a half miles farther inland the shoreline\nConsisted of marshes and much less\nSo when folks would bring their ships and they would get stuck\nAnd then they build docks and here is try and make up for that and it was just a mess [noise]\nSome of those ships abandoned by gold prospectors were converted to makeshift saloons\nOthers just became landfill so in the nineteenth century the state of California teams the wildcat seen by filling in the flats they surrounded the bay filled with the wall that's underneath our feet it's a few feet wide at the base rock and brick under concrete but it's cracking and failing\nLowe says ... top priority is to protect the wall and a hundred billion dollars of economic assets behind it from the risk of an earthquake and what geologists call lick with action\nIf a significant seismic event or to occur\nThe solid grounds which start to behave more like jello and spread and so one of the risk to the wall is that it could spread at least five seed out into the bank\nThe port is still studying exactly where prop a money would go first probably a critical area two thirds of a mile long near the ferry building that's where ... while could send water into a transit tunnel opening and cause problems in bart's trans bay to\nSo much of the city is critical infrastructure runs underneath Carol\n... says right behind the seawall that includes a utility in communication highway\nSo you could have damaged immunity to have damaged a marketer roadway and you could have damage to a number of our utilities water in power\nThat would have city wide implications [noise] if\nPast this bond is just the beginning as sort of down payment on a multi decade strengthening project planning for more than just earthquake [noise]\nClimate change is already helping push extreme high tides and storms up over the last [noise] the only public opponents are popping the San Francisco Libertarian Party argue that sea level rise is a slow moving threat and property owners should handle it on their own but at a press\nConference in April assemblyman Dave chew who supports prop ... said recent studies show the problem is accelerating\nWe know that the estimates of sea level rise by the end of the next century or anywhere from four to ten feet we need to fix the seawall\nAccording to reports sponsored pull from earlier this year over Seventy percent of San Franciscans agree so the bond may well get the two thirds vote required to pass\nDignity health the giants and tech companies are funding the yes campaign the mayor is for it as is every city supervisor including Jane Kim who represents the area south of market\nIs incredibly important that we make prudish investments today to strengthen the seawall shield and strengthen the unbreakable bond between the city of San Francisco and the waterfront that we'd love so much\nOver decades those investments will add up adapting the waterfront to earthquakes and rising tides could cost up to five billion dollars\nPort officials say they don't exactly know how they'll do that [noise]\nBut they argue that the protection offered by the seawall now is vital and the clock is ticking on its future I'm Molly Peterson cake you eating needed [noise]\nWater is also on the ballot for the rest of the state with props three and eight point nine billion dollar water bond and it created some division you might not expect some environmental groups are for it but some are against\nJoining me now to explain that is Kiki weedy science reporter Lauren Sommer hey Lauren Hi so what exactly is in this water bond and what will it pay for\nI said this bond is it you know those big packs of Halloween candy we see right now where there's all kinds of mixed in there that's exactly what this water bond isn't just a huge grab bag of water projects\nYou've got more than two billion dollars to restore watersheds places like Lake Tahoe and San Francisco bay some of that money would actually go to improving forest which could also\nKobe some of that money would actually go to improving forest which could also reduce fire risk there's money in there to help communities that don't have safe drinking water right now to help them clean it up and there's money in there for water recycling and water conservation just a whole host of other things so huge mix\nSo that sounds like a lot of things that are environmental groups like why are some against it well what's\nYour least favorite Halloween candy definitely candy corn okay so for some groups this water bond has some candy corn mixed in this big bag of Halloween candy they are not a fan of it um it has to do with this big canal and the Central Valley called the Frank current canal it delivers water to farmers that grow our food\nThe problem is that the farmers there have really pumped a lot of ground water out of the ground and so much so that the land there is thinking and that's damaging this big can now\nSo some of the money in this water bond would go to fixing the canal and groups like the Sierra Club don't like that they don't want to see state tax payer money go to federally owned projects like this canal\nOkay but didn't California voters just pass a big water bond\nYes yeah and twenty fourteen we pass prop one which was a seven point five billion dollar water bond that we're currently spending right now that's kinda how we tend to fund water infrastructure and Steve is with these big bonds\nUm but that bond prop one was put on the ballot by the state legislature\nThis bond props three was put on by special interests and a little bit more pay to play\nAnd so that's been a big criticism of it if that it doesn't quite have the oversight that some of the other water bonds have had one last question will grab bag of water projects be half off after Halloween a that would be quite a deal I don't think so though\nAll right thank you learn things that we've cake you read science reporter
