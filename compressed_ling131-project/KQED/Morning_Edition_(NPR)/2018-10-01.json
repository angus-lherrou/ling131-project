News\nOkay if you're looking for a cheaper health insurance and you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these\nAre a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining on shore to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescription\nTom and they may not cover things like prescriptions are mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bell after that the ... met some people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlice jak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your house

Iraq's three Kurdish region\nI'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin voters in Iraq's three Kurdish region's went to the polls yesterday to elect a new regional parliament\nThis part of Iraq has been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen nineties to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his interest joins us now from the Kurdish city of ...\nGene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Kurdish parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that has existed for decades and they will continue their control\nBut the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it's aimed at young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe market is not just on a deeply out to be implemented in reality but fortunately he fought using the officers who make things look good cause inside the multi almost lost huh\nAnd my dad he means that he and one of the voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people who was turned out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the PKK immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations weak on and one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballot so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the name of each party's very laborious process so even a disapproved polling station which you'd think would be like supers cooking or people trying to get him to fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the result to question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between\nThe Kurdish regional government and the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affect the the relationship with that\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes\nSo the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that the Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy\nSo it's all quite up in the air but um yeah a lot of challenges ahead for

checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris going I think good morning so who are these two we\nActually well the prices being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist there's now with the Andy Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and by ... hunt Joe at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six [noise] now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes just a complete surprise itself not this year these things are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists\nDo well I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties he was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution in cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning that's the word ... how do\nYou have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs one example one of these drugs that you may have heard about it as a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on\nAttacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and it certainly is there more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how how we think about cancer ...\nWell before the scientist made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese right I mean we hear a lot of in you know therapy how effective are these ... therapy one really wants to know a win\nAnd that's it and evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies that failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of cancer research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of\nThe ... okay NPR science correspondents Richard Harris that there's no doubt when

D I'm Brian why\nOne year ago today a gunman shot and killed fifty eight people at a music festival in Las Vegas in what became the worst mass shooting in modern us history hundreds of others were injured\nIn the hours that followed it became clear that a good number of people there were members of California's public safety community one of them was Christopher ... a firefighter works out of Cal Fire San Luis Obispo unit\nHe was at the route Ninety One harvest festival with his wife and eight friends one of whom was killed ... said lives that night and he spoke with cake you eat in the days after the shooting we've asked him to come back and tell us how he's doing Chris thanks for doing this I thank you for having me a year later how often are you thinking about it\nEvery day probably every ten to twenty minutes so it's it's always on my mind never goes away\nAnd what are the first images that come when you do think about it\nWhen it first happened all I saw was the uh the the side of deaths and injuries and just people grieving so in a year it's been more positive now I'm helping people it's been better the last few months so\nSo more recently you you're seeing yourself helping people out there Yes sir you helped a lot of people that night have you been able to reconnect with any of them\nSo uh six weeks after the incident uh one of the guys I helped to reached out to me a Facebook Messenger and I ended up being the guy that helps them out of the uh venue and government to an ambulance and ah we ended up or\nReconnecting a man of the restaurant and now we've actually quite a few times he was a really good guy I'm his name's ... he spent a four weeks of summers hospital in Vegas He's had multiple surgeries but he's a strong guy\nI guess he's had multiple surgeries but he's a strong guy\nIn what was it like just seen him in that restaurant that first time\nIt was amazing because there was a time for a while we're\nJust wasn't filling my job I'm you know during the firefighting thing you're always used to helping someone but when I was put in that situation that night I was I didn't know if I wanted to do it anymore but are reconnecting whether that was a it gave me\nMotivation to go back and I love my job of getting\nI was going to ask you is your job has been good therapy in the last year but you've kind of answered my question it sounds like it hasn't always been this purpose of going out and fighting a fire\nNo but the the really good thing about the fire services or the support you get from you know the guys and gals that I work with so they'd been awesome to me\nSo do you feel like we've gotten through this as a country that in some way we are closer together\nNow [noise] ah it's\n\nThe answer I give is yes but then there's also no I mean there's been\nOther shootings since since that time obviously you know the school and the church and uh sometimes I Do think that and then sometimes I I think we're you know people have already forgotten which is kind of sad but uh and you know in the community where I live people haven't forgotten\nYou lost a member of your community that night Hannah ... how have you and your friends honored her\nHair or start we we do a lot a lot of stuff um most of the time it's just us being together not being\nScared to go out and do things together along with my wife the other friends ... husband Brian we talk constantly and we're just always there for each other so everything we do we choose to Hannah so uh we've we've had started this has textures to Hannah and it's kind of going viral kind of cool oh\nAnother thing you said very understandably a year ago was that you hadn't slept much and you didn't know when things would return to normal yeah have things returned to normal\n[noise] ah it's a new normal um as far as the sleeping and stuff goes yeah it's good it has gotten better uh I I Do a lot of therapy over the last few months so to kind of get to where I'm at now so it it it's baby steps it's it's never going to be the same\nNever there's still a lot of survivors out there um but you know live in fear and uh [noise] uh I Hope that we can keep on hill and\nChris thank you thank spring appreciate it\nChris ... is a firefighter with Cal Fire and he was there the night a gunman shot and killed fifty eight people at the route Ninety One harvest

passed down from his father\n[noise] my dad taught me if I wait\nWhat she was not to shoot\nKeith agrees there needs to be more education around ten safety and he approves of raising the age of gun ownership to Twenty one to me I\n'cause a lot of times people don't teach their kids proper way how to use a gun or\nThe other bills signed by the governor for him it's gun ownership for people who have been hospitalized or otherwise placed on an involuntary psychiatric cold for risk of hurting themselves or others twice in one year they should have been a long time\nShe think that would have prevented other mass shootings\nGun show promoter guy Myers disagreed\nMore gun laws don't solve that problem the problem is we're not enforcing the laws that we have on many levels [noise]\nThose

know attack us fight internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very ... I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do\nFind all saying you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel is a a bipartisan support and I believe will have a ... in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you see that we could have agreements and disagreements with ministers was for example we\nYou know it's no secret of how to disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we signed an animal you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and I appreciate\nUh so we can have disagreements have you

where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today lets you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who are born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improves those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can kind of neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen shady and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nAdolescent surprised that we done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was a segregated city where low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem the group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors\nAnd strong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it's singled out segregation as a key obstacle and now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at this to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of share a map of median income and Charlotte said\nA lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms them to Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity\nThe outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank\nBarnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the two of has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership Charlotte's effort\nTo improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority\nWhite neighbors not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric ... says the schools students are mostly black\nAnd Hispanic so we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four or five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body this largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now in an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown and now we're in the coming years to change it started to live more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThe century old neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity areas where the truth is that may not be hot opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead\nThose kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood Ford says the opportunity at should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us certainly can really smart and really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allowed to look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction

who's discoveries have led to a revolution in cancer treatment\nAnd nobody on the family have days to warn the Tucson Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine join to James on the phone and who do\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris going Richard good morning so who are these two winters\nWell the prices being shared of course by James Alison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and by ... at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes it's a complete surprise me off knock this year these things are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells and they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on your immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to infect what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment\nIt led to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard of that we've talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Allison the other scientists who is winning this word touch school how do\nYou have any you know that have a hundred work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nWhat example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... Trudeau nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but she found a different set\nLine of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and it certainly is there more effective target\nOh fascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about ...\nWell before the so I just made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and this whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese days right I mean we hear a lot about him you know therapy how effective are these new therapies that one really wants to know right when\nThat that's an evolving issue it in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies that failed\nAnd some people had remarkable recoveries remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is off the end of the story\nOK NPR science correspondent Richard Harris with us Nobel winners thank you so much by pleasure It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep seven forty nine now let's go back to Joe McConnell's desk for more about your ride to work today\nWithout any particular reason for itself six eighty to ... ... bridges crawling along for several miles through a lot of counties far back as a marsh erode what you're south of the bridge it's okay to get to conquered and just the usual two forty two to twenty four jam ...

Luis Obispo unit\nHe was at the route Ninety One harvest festival with his wife and eight friends one of whom was killed what so save lives that night and he spoke with ... in the days after the shooting we've asked him to come back and tell us how he's doing Chris thanks for doing this\nI thank you for having me a year later how often are you thinking about it\nEvery day probably every ten to twenty minutes which it's always on my mind never goes away\nAnd what are the first images that come when you do think about it when it first happened all I saw was the uh you know this\nThe sign of deaths and injuries and just people grieving\nSo in a year it's been more positive now I'm helping people it's been better the last few months so\nSo more recently you you're seeing yourself helping people out\nThere Yes sir you helped a lot of people that night have you been able to reconnect with any of them\nSo uh six weeks after the incident uh\nOne of the guys I helped to reached out to me a Facebook Messenger and I ended up being the guy that helps them out of the venue and gone into an ambulance and ah\nWe ended up or reconnecting uh met at a restaurant and now we've actually quite a few times he's really good guy\nI'm his name's act he spent a four weeks of summers hospital in Vegas He's had multiple surgeries but uh he's a strong guy\nIn what was it like just seen him in a restaurant that first time\nIt was amazing because there was a time for a while where\nI just wasn't filling my job I'm you know doing a firefighter and saying you're always used to helping someone but when I was put in that situation that night I just I didn't know if I wanted to do it anymore but are reconnecting whether that was a it gave me motivation to\nGo back and I love my job again\nI was going to ask you is your job has been good therapy in the last year but you've kinda answered my question it sounds like it hasn't always been this purpose of going out and fighting a fire\nNow but the the really good thing about the fire services or the support you get from you know the guys and gals that I work with so they'd been awesome to me\nSo do you feel like we've gotten through this as a country that in some way we are closer together\nNow [noise] ah it's\nAh [noise]\nThe answer I give is yes but then there's also no I mean there's been\nOther shootings since since that time obviously you know the school and the church and uh sometimes I Do think that and then sometimes I I think we're you know people have already forgotten which is kind of sad but uh and you know in the community where I live people haven't forgotten\nYou lost a member of your community that night Hannah ... how have you and your friends honored her\nOur start we\n[noise] we do a lot a lot of stuff um most of the time it's just us being together not being scared\nTo go out and do things together along with my wife the other friends ... husband Brian we talk constantly and we're just always there for each other so everything we do we choose to Hannah so uh we've we've had started this hashtags here's Dana and it's kind of gone viral it's kinda cool\nOh another thing you said very understandably a year ago was that you hadn't slept much\nAnd you didn't know when things would return\n... a year ago was that you hadn't slept much and you didn't know when things\nWould return to normal yeah have things return to normal [noise] ah it's a new normal\nUm as far as the sleeping and stuff goes yeah it's it has gotten better uh I I Do a lot of therapy over the last few months so to kind of get to where I'm at now so it's ... it's baby steps it's it's never going to be the same\nRemember there's still a lot of survivors out there um but you know live in fear and uh uh I Hope that we can keep on hill and\nChris thank you thank spring appreciate it\nChris ... is a firefighter with Cal Fire and he was there the night a gunman shot and killed fifty eight people at the route Ninety One harvest festival in Las Vegas a year ago on this date\nLet's head now to Antioch where reporter Monica ... attended a gun show this weekend at the county fairgrounds people there had mixed reactions to a couple of new gun bills signed by Governor Brown\nFisher is a volunteer at the show she's not when did the tables full of gun ranging from revolver just lock to assault rifle purchased my first one I was probably in my mid twenties Fisher doesn't support\nThe new law which raises a legal age to Twenty one purchased a gun she believes gun safety is not related to the age of the gun owner that how well educated that person is about operating ... she's here with our ten year old daughter\nShe knows how to operate a firearm supervise [noise] you know with all the safety parameters we do you know the I see the an air safety and she enjoys that and it's something that she loves to do\nFisher and some other gun owners here say if young adults are old enough to choose to serve in the military they should be able to purchase a guy at the other end of the XO any act resident Russell Keith is looking at custom rifle he got his first got him when he was twelve it was passed down from his father\nMy dad taught me to find a way\nWhich was not to shoot\nKeith agrees there needs to be more education around gun safety and he approves of raising the age of gun ownership to Twenty one\nTo me I have a problem with that\n'cause a lot of times people don't teach their kids proper way how to use it then\nThe other bills signed by the governor for his gun ownership for people who have been hospitalized or otherwise placed on an involuntary psychiatric cold for risk of hurting themselves or others twice in one year they should have been a long time\nHe thinks that would have prevented other mass shootings\nGun show promoter guy Myers disagreed\nMore gun laws don't solve that problem the problem is we're not enforcing the laws that we have on many levels\nThose laws will go into effect in January ...

forty six\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin voters in Iraq's three Kurdish region's went to the polls yesterday to elect a new regional parliament\nIs part of a rocket been semi autonomous and the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen nineties to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Thursday in a raft joins us now from the Kurdish city of ...\nGene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Kurdish parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that has existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well\nHere's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThat democracy is not just on the way you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately sitting in for using the officers who make things look good falls but inside the not so much more [noise] huh\nAnd my dad he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control a lot of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people was turned out good as a result of this frustration you're at polling stations right yeah\nThat was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're signing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the things years has always been fears of front there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the PKK immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nHere's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations weak on in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch from start to count some of the ballot you know there's an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out singing each party's very before he is process [laughter] so even at disapproved polling station which you'd think would be like supers cocky people trying to get in with fake IDs huh\nSupers people trying to get in the fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the resulting question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations and how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government\nAnd the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "01"}
