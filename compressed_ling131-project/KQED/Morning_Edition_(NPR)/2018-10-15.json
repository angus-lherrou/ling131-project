Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and in Boulder there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be older because what if the Democrats take it by narrow margins it won't be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goal I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he casts them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause she's eighty or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overarching goal\nAnd if they managed to hang onto power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding the wall replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll

drink bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources at the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lump sum shelf\n... filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it has a point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably your global sales have been

has become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas in kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know you have ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that up what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer in and hopefully you have people you've converting some scotch do remain bourbon drinkers or you take your profits back\nOr which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of 'em\nSaving the obviously it's a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that has um when you have conversations with people you run into people that were having conflicted feelings are\nI think we all understand there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you um ... again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue\nDo you mean an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean Congress and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSaid the meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows who

overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better make the\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\n... yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and from my standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our

for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he casts them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause she's eighty or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the

any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it wouldn't be a good

it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump Andy is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper still and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association described your product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources of the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lump sum shelf\nShell filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we explored Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nIf Katie's the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably your global sales have been not pacing\nYour domestic failed while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ...\nFrom the store to store but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a ... you agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that up what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nWe'll ah we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase taxes no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer in and hopefully you have people you've converting some scotch do remain Berman drinkers or you take your profits back\nOr which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid in the obvious since the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans are law could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much ah it come up as an\nIssue you made an issue like an election yeah it has to come up I mean\nCancun bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSet up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what probably means the Kentucky or he will not for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah in and he told us he understood exactly did this with this issue to mean for us\nBerman is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to nine tenths of federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced they could move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in America if you want to sell you better making Kentucky\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if it hasn't been\nA yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from a standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking\nBefore you know we might lose people bar industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generation Eric\nGregory Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be voting because if the Democrats take it by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says that high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blamed Trump's for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval because she's eighty or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power and Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding them all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nSanta Eighteen minutes before it will take another look at you

D the China's now seven forty five\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News good morning I'm Steve Inskeep and I'd like to Martin Newt Gingrich will tell you he saw something in Donald Trump early on and made him believe Trump could win the presidency\nAnd that's something done great soccer has a lot to do with how he sees himself the former speaker of the house made a name for himself by breaking a lot of political norms and refusing to compromise with the other side\nMuch like President Trump the Atlantic magazine's McKay cop and spend some time with Newt Gingrich recently for a profile he did it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome the cake topping is in our studio this morning thanks for coming in thanks for having me so you went to spend some time with Newt Gingrich\nAnd he suggested suggested that you do so at the Philadelphia Zoo\n[laughter] that's all right how come well he is a famous uh animal lover he's you know donated disease around the world he he loves animals but I think also what became clear to me as I got there\nIs that he sees animals as useful metaphors for him as we were kind of touring the zoo he was you know pointing out the lions and saying you know this is what the lions teach us about gender politics and this is what a crocodiles teach us about uh about the way that we should pursue change what\nWas most interesting to me though at one point he was talking about chimpanzees I\nAm kind of how how vicious they are or how aggressive they are and you know I said I didn't really know what to say so I started you know oh there's the viciousness of the animal world any kind of caught me off and was very stern and said it's not vicious it's natural right and I think that he draws those parallels with\nHow he abused politics and how we view human affairs in general and\nHe likens himself to other conservative leader cheap basically described to you for waves of contemporary conservative politics a Barry ...
