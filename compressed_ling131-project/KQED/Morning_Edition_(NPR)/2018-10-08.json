California history roared to life\nFueled by high when the cubs fire burn through the north bay hills and into Santa Rosa it would destroy more than five thousand homes and buildings and kill twenty two people since then the community has been grappling with a tough question if wildfire is a normal part of the California landscape\nHow and where should residents rebuild\n... science reporter Lauren summer has been looking into that dilemma\n[noise]\nThe drywall just about to get a lot although in Taos New house and finally the waiting room so be\nIt you know get bathroom guest bedroom [noise] my daughter's full bathroom my daughter bedroom\nSeeing already mentally moving in and he walks in the construction site and\nIt appears down really moving as quickly as you'd like it too but yeah I used to know that the ends inside\nIt was one year ago late at night when loans are left his house in large field that house that used to stand here because he was called them to work\n\nWork [noise]\nThe the low when all is assistant fire marshal in Santa Rosa the tubs fire was grilling on the other side of town and he had to get people out\nOr sirens on our peace or some people was embers and spot fires were literally starting peoples' yards\nThe night wore on and the winds didn't let up\n[noise] to exploding at a rate that I Would have never imagine would occur he drove north past his neighborhood\nYou couldn't actually make out individual homes in heritage is looked like an entire wall of fire and then realized right away the\nHouse gone and so he began the long process of starting over like so many others and pretty quickly a crucial question came up should people rebuild\nIn California wildfire isn't a freak occurrence it's a fact of life and the times fire with a repeat of the handling fire which fifty four years ago burned the same area\nWill unfold thought about that but he was keenly aware of the fires effect on an already tight housing market\nAnd made a decision that have made more sense to rebuild your but honestly it also has a lot to do with my daughter could I have convinced that we can live in a really cool place somewhere else maybe um but this was her home and this time that home will be better protected\nSo you'll see like the ... structures hardy wars that citing made with cement fibers gets more fire resistant than would between the roof deciding things learn nature uh there's definitely a stuff that I wanted to\nCoach now we're fire building with fire resistant materials skiff you live in a place designated by local and state governments as a wild fires out\nBut even though it's house burned low in the house wasn't technically in a wild fires out so those stricter codes don't apply to him or did with neighbors I asked Santa Rosa's director of planning an economic development David un about that\nWe don't have a an extra set of rules are are requirements that we put on people um to to rebuild\nWe met at the city's permit office for fire\nYears has been working nights and weekends to speed up approvals so far about a third of the homes lost have gotten permits but whether to rebuild and a fire zone you and says it's not the city's decision\nThat these are individual property is owned by individuals the city doesn't have the right to take that property away from them or so you can't rebuild\nAbout half of the buildings lost in Santa Rosa that don't have to meet the wildfire building codes because they weren't zone for fire given says legally the city couldn't change that zoning overnight\nAnd getting people back in their homes back to normal has been a priority we had a housing crisis before the fire then in a matter of days five percent of the city's housing stock vanished\nReally to walk and chew gum at the same time we're going to rebuild our communities fasting quickly is officially as we possibly can but we also have to build new homes as fast as we can\nNow the question is where to put that new housing the city is trying to entice developers to build downtown but one big town home project is proposed for the hills right where the fire swept through just a year ago\n[noise]\nTo this is the forty acre parcel or are they want to put the two hundred and thirty seven homes can definitely see the fire came right through here the trees all around me are\nAre black and almost all the way to the top\nAs I'm standing there a man walking by comes up to\nMe so I'm looking at the same for the development and said\nNow they want to put homes here go figure\nI definitely wouldn't want to live there\nHe didn't want me to record that though\nIt didn't go into public carrying round ... village project mitigated negative\nTucked in February the city council debated the project that developer San Francisco bay city ventures made the case of the town homes would meet wildfires building codes and provide affordable housing one city council member Julie combs had her doubts\nWe are setting a precedent to build more new housing in a fire hazard area when we vote today I just think we need to not put more sleeping people in a fire hazard area\nBut other city council members like John Sawyer didn't see it that way\nWe absolutely need the housing and lots of lots of mistakes were made in the past and saying no\nThe vote was pretty lopsided I was really sorry to be alone vote that's Julie combs and I know I've heard stories of flooding along the Mississippi and thought why did they keep rebuilding their I think it seems completely obvious that we should be asking that question about a fire hazard here here why did we keep rebuilding their\nShe says there are people who don't want to stay in a fire zone but they're tied to their property sometimes insurance company said you have to rebuild and the same place or you just can't afford to go elsewhere and the city doesn't have a way to buy people out\nCome says there is a big push for instilled development closer to downtown but she worries that more sprawl is coming and it's tough to make those decisions when the trauma of the fire is still raw\nI think that in a disaster there's such a strong emotional pull to get what you lost back I think that's a powerful pull\nIts appalled at Santa Rosa and lots of other California communities affected by fire will be facing for years to come I'm Lauren Sommer

people rebuild\nIn California wildfire isn't a freak occurrence it's a fact of life and the fire was a repeat of the handling fire which fifty four years ago burns the same area will unfold thought about that but he was keenly aware of the fires effect on an already tight housing market\nAnd made a decision that it made more sense to rebuild your but honestly it also has a lot to do with my daughter to Mr that we can live in a really cool place somewhere else maybe um but this was our home\nAnd this time that Holmes will be better protected [noise]\nSo you'll see like the structure is the heart of words that siding made with cement fibers gets more fire resistant than what between the roof deciding things of that nature um there's definitely a stuff that I wanted to\nCoach now we're fire building with fire resistant materials skiff you live in a place designated by local and state governments as a wild fires out\nBut even though it's house burned lone wolf house wasn't technically in a wild fires out so those stricter codes don't apply to him or to his neighbors I asked Santa Rosa is director of planning an economic development David un about that\nWe don't have a an an extra set of rules are are requirements that we put on people um to to rebuild\nWe met at the city's permit officer fired victims\nBut the staff here has been working nights and weekends to speed up approvals so far about a third of the homes lost have gotten permits but whether to rebuild Ina fire zone you and says it's not the city's decision\nThat these are individual property is owned by individuals the city doesn't have the right to take that property away from them or say you can't rebuild\nAbout half of the buildings lost in Santa Rosa that don't have to meet the wildfire building codes because they weren't zone for fire you and says legally the city couldn't change that zoning overnight\nAnd getting people back in their homes back to normal has been a priority we had a housing crisis before this higher than in a matter of days five percent of the city's housing stock vanished\nWe need to walk and chew gum at the same time we're going to rebuild our communities fast and quickly and as efficiently as we possibly can but we also have to build new homes as fast as we can\nNow the question is where to put that new housing the city is trying to entice developers to build downtown but one big town home project is proposed for the hills right where the fire swept through just a year ago\n[noise]\nSo this is the forty acre parcel or are they wanted to put the two hundred and thirty seven homes can definitely see the fire came right through here the trees all around me are\nAre black and almost all the way to the top\nAs I'm standing there man walking by comes up to me\nBecause I'm looking at the time for the development and said\nNow they want to put homes here go figure\nI definitely wouldn't want to live there\nHe didn't want me to record that to\nThe point to public hearing round ... village project mitigated negative\nIn February the city council debated the project the developer San Francisco bay city ventures made the case that the town homes would meet wildfires building codes and provide affordable housing one city council member Julie combs had her doubts we are setting oppressed\nCity council member Julie combs had her doubts we are setting a precedent to build more new housing in a fire hazard area when we vote today I just think we need to not put more sleeping people in a fire hazard area\nBut other city council members like John Sawyer didn't see it that way\nWe absolutely need the housing and blossom ... lots of mistakes were made in the past and saying no\nThe vote was pretty lopsided I was really sorry to be alone vote that's Julie comes and I know I've heard stories of flooding along the Mississippi and thought why did they keep rebuilding their\nI think it seems completely obvious that we should be asking that question about a fire hazard Perry and why did we keep rebuilding their she says there are people who don't want to stay in a fires out but they're tied to their property sometimes insurance companies say you have to rebuild and the same place or you just can't afford to go elsewhere\nAnd the city doesn't have a way to bite people out\nComes as there is a big push for instill development closer to downtown but she worries that more sprawl is coming\nAnd it's tough to make those decisions when the trauma of the fire is still raw I think that in a disaster there's such a strong emotional pull to get what you lost back\nI think that's a powerful pull its appalled at Santa Rosa and lots of other California communities affected by fire will be facing for years to come
