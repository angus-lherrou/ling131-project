San Francisco in ... or highland Sacramento I'm Laurie centers good morning it's three o'clock\nBefore we start today's episode we want you to know this broadcast contains tape that describe violent events some there's some profane language that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be forewarned way you're\n\nListening to radio [noise]\nRadio prominently there'll be you and why [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise] they're\nGoing to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before\nThan say something high [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah certainly getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown's shooting in Ferguson and\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when I became a national\nStory [noise] there was a lot of belly again and the press how many people do we see killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nNear rice and Harris than double John journals become sort of a national story [noise] and I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police different health\nAnd the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching their word Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBirth so birth study had Florida the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records lawsuit\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... men sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida I think three hundred and eighty eight\nEmails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired\nA firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not this involves a year of work do you how many police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive saying that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nLike Ben put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show back\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh is this summer here to check it out yeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages so I have a stack of papers that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we got him broken\nDown by county but you can see uh [noise] so a or B county\nBook or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through the alphabet\nAnd you basically just has a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers and spread across the entire ...\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent a eight hundred and thirty one\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford dot edu\nWas go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise] didn't involve a an armed suspect when they're chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those poets than we thought looked like learn from these let's see how how we can come out of the data and build a data base and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some\nConclusions from lessens some solutions\nThis all went into an online database to Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will off link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they say about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like in the most basic level a are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas that whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at the time of the shooting in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cops which is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raised as a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a\nWeapon so it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm gonna make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ...\nThis is something that people will cover police apparently know quite well you know the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly\nPolice are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what does the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and it's just that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying firearms nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to\nFeel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far in percent six kind of person he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to where we were in why we want to start\nThis methane gas still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know [noise] I mean they're all written in this ah\nSupplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call and this is the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony's Arnold\nArmed with a knife a department to fight it you know every one of these every report there's at least one human life someone was either\nYou know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table that the investigation of the death\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople run\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders stock to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMac guilty and then traveled around floored on a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one\nUs in reaching out wherever I told my main something happened in you know here in Florida\nAnd then we're going to find them in the ... the club that nobody really wants\nFamily more than just\nAnd I could not have made\nI think there'll be by and I wouldn't be doing anything\nOr so after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the moms they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you get to the every every event or you know different under the noses\nAnd has been telling everyone about them\n... ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but they get it must be part of the different types of learning part of ... right right we all just simply trying to find our way is a critical\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age when I was talking to two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some big\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really goes on in my house she says his age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then I then went to the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\n\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen\nCooking chicken now the guy\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nIn the night before they'd all gone out dancing together and [noise]\n\n[noise] through the summer when a fire\n\nAnd now

some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars [noise]\nAbout twelve people in in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass so\nWe usually the video message saying now that video\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police caught attained behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we called the execution of vegetables I says to the guardian was invested\nAnd all that but I I Am then 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in releasing sit down and take and stuff we came back here all you can smell what's right\nAnd so now like when you play any like it's it's not it is not as bad now but just the association for when a plane onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... brings you right back here mhm\nYep and the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nBecause I started ... some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find to be a lot of what a bad economy a couple of women handed me the phone my\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just daring us out with us but I Know [noise]\nAl ... we haven't been I have\nIt was also very ... we saw that last week\nAnd I walk in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nYeah my son's greatest about Fifteen minutes\nMy visit home I have to go there all the time of course yeah that would force how could you not\nAnd you know what you want to go take a chair and said fair yeah and it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every day and it's just a little white man\nHis share everything that I like he literally I think he does he liked to have one every day\nI Love it it's a way I like going on in all of that and it's a little white guy that always did not know\nTaking care of the whole\nI never [noise]\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and I felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nYou can even be deal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one year ago\nJews on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother I watched as my daughter was lower than to the ...\nAnd it was around the time that a few of these women started to call themselves the mothers of the movement [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC\n[noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nKind of felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun a man with a knife down\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment between you guys

everybody to know the police both can't kill\nA fan of our parents want\nMe to pick him up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the un huh\nSo this is the thing that you guys we use this video for\nWhat it does warn of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the point suite at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the the guy leans into court judge that women you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... hey hey hey this is important get their guys partner was holding a gun have you heard that you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek Derek Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of or a poor that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finished watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight go through the neighborhood if you missed out on the front step waves of hatred what are you doing man that dared does stupid sort of a bitch you and how close you came to be in bed wouldn't be backwards medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again are almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this this at the moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say ... primary election among the big winners they told him he just said he is now ... county sheriff Mike shit would was elected sheriff of Linn county [noise]\nI Am\nWhich is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to them and the other thing you mentioned is dead or children belong to this organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition oblique cheese and a twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life\nNot just a month after ... put out this principle two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women who have I have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing way policing is done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make you just feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too\nBut [noise] there was this experience than I had read realized\nHow far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\n\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to\nThis is Ryan ...

think is you want your kid to be offensive but next time I'm ...

I remember ... this is radio lab we had been discussing police violence and raise mostly in Florida we met the mothers who gather from all over the country and we met the police chief in Daytona who who's trying out some different things I was thinking maybe\nMaybe yeah maybe there's a little bit hopeful yeah it's a feeling we had a but then you realize hope it's a funny difficult thing um because well we'll let ... reporters taken from here\nWe are here to see the Tosh Clemens touched Clemens mother Rodney Mitchell [noise]\nSo it's actually the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center I've met for them to other mothers who've lost their children are that's actually when I first met her bed and had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because band was going to hand a ton of documents over ten Pasha on her son Romney's case 'cause she didn't have any\nAnd I was there because we set up a short interview in ... but when we got your doors [noise]\n\nShe just started shopping [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd\nAnd I just had no idea what\n\nBut then she had just turned the tape recorder off huh so what was what was happening in that moment well okay so to back up to meeting somebody like that chip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I I Believe but\nThe thing about a chip would um share of the police chief is that\nThe only have the power to fire a police officer and that's really about it after that it goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Ronnie twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nAfter the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong and acted in accordance with the law and it just so happened at forty five minutes before then and I\nShould have better door she just got an email from her lawyers saying that the appeal that she'd filed against that decision I had just been rejected and so we sat there in ... department for a while we actually\nEven left for like an hour eventually came\nBack [noise] kind of just hit reset on the whole thing [noise]\n... got a big smile they smile right white smiling and we sat down in her kitchen table um okay so uh if you can walk me back to the night that kind of everything everything happened\nIt's June eleven two thousand twelve Natasha was at home nine thirty at night Rodney who is twenty three years old was a back from college you know driving a car and that's when all the phone call started happening people calling saying something going on with your car\nAnd then for Columbus Day much at the same with sunshine and ... to the mid seventies it's currently fifty eight degrees here in San Francisco\n\nIs ... San Francisco ... highland Sacramento it's foreign ... [noise]\nYou cannot be afraid to share I had never been in an environment that was so motion each child is actually the reason you're telling\nYour second grade daughter that's just move sex we\nFight started and I hit her as hard as I can and she actually fell down I have an eight year old son there's no way to let them play touch with people\nMaybe you are an obsessive sports fan war they'd be more casual fan and you follow just a couple of sports teams or maybe pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV whichever the case\nWhen you do see those athletes it's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context\nAs a full grown adult wearing a uniform performing under extraordinary pressure focused on highly specialized task has zero to do with daily life or at least your daily life but is that who those people really are and how they get so good at this thing they do\nWhen you see them on TV all you're seeing is the outcome but what were the input and we understand that elite athletes represents some magical combination of talent and determination but what about safe luck so my gosh ah\nI I yes absolutely I think that's a ton of luck involved\nBut Shawn Johnson an American gymnast who's one limping gold medal and many other top honors\nKind of like the miracle math kind of equation has said equal the perfect answer I mean you can't get hurt you have to be healthy you can't have that flew on the wrong day you have to find the right ... ... four days\nAll these random things and when you like get all the people who fit that equation not laughter as many people so I guess I was just the best of the very few who fit that equation\nAnd today on freakonomics radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war and colonizing two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement [laughter]\n\nAn episode to we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise to San Francisco forty niners and how they have a gun to recover from a debilitating losing streak\nI don't know when you lose a game a lot and always happens when you lose to a ton happens usually three is like Armageddon [noise] I'm\nTrying not in today's episode becoming an athlete\nTime to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened some scientific is the process how predictable will look at the number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both super suddenly athletes will look at will determination\nI did a bunch of push ups and sit ups back night until I was I'm throwing up\nAnd the mental aspect of this most physical pursuit ... well I think the mind is is as big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools will hear stories of opportunities gained\nAnd lost in Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen forty seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand eight teams seven points\nAmerican players in the major leagues as of two thousand eight teams seven point eight percent and we're one story\nIt's almost too good to be true they said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you're blowing up the ram you know your everywhere and you just have no idea [noise]\n\n\n\nHis freakonomics radio shelling that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house even\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field sports or music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get so that how much of that ability where they born\nHow much is attributable to hard work can practice this is a debate that's been going on probably forever nature versus nurture raw talent versus what's called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become great at just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious things come great at anything you need both talent in lots of each but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because\nAthletic success like any success and leave money failure it's what you might call multi factorial\nLot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also ended up identical\nAs much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe\nReal life is more nuanced than that also interesting [noise] so I mean [noise]\nJay Z sold drugs grew up\nIn the Marshall project to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL\nNow he is a\nMulti multi millionaire married to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today\nSo why don't we set it up so that all young men must sell drugs when barricades\nAnd um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York\nI mean she had a great talent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like\nHe happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me and I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happen that were just happenstance that led me to the positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should\nBe that should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star\nYes you're ... and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best get on your team\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always ... uh and I actually enjoy playing basketball more um I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child\nIn super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve letter we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and be trolley ball\nOh man well my my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar the athletes they both come from very athletic family\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shipped friend who is one two and then put gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and next surgeries and everything but she still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up\nAnd the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson\nHe was a hockey player he wrestled he did the ... race NATO acts I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas Donald a is about six\nTo um lean a\nBanging guy\nThomas played basketball at a small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player in the college program is far from ... one day in the gym he was bragging about how high you could jump and the best\nAbout how high you could jump\nAnd the best jumper on the track team a guy named Carlos overheard him and said you know you're talking all that trash um you wouldn't even clear bars six foot six and a real competition and Donald says yes yes I Would\nPercent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I kept I thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nWhich I thought you might say that's a crazy like this college fencing even existed\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that offensive but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ...\nHave a fencing think the only exception be my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nTheir three different blades there's a there's a burglar soil and there's male female fancy\nAnd given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors end up being college fences there about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit think fencing increases your chances from that point four percent based fine\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else costs and something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are\nFifteen fold we should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades

forget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like\nThree hundred thousand kids\nPlaying high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be taught soccer players

talents drive the right kind of practice maybe a parent or to to get you to the ring to the gym or the track at five AM band as Shawn Johnson told us earlier he might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches\nSo how'd that happen it was kind of freak occurrence make actual Chinese born and raised Chinese um when he was\nThree years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast and he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian are lumpy ends there were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood\nJohnson had started her training at the different gym\nAnd I loved it it was awesome but child my coach that took me to you on backs opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house and my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was\nReally really last fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have very loving very very protective people around me\nAnd he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me safe and I am forever grateful for that Mm\nSean Johnson's good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether through bad luck\nOr to me is whether if you're bad luck war do something much more concrete like lack of money over the past decade youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of uses words involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about true true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen ...\nIt's a tournament in California this weekend the next week and you go to Nevada after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them ...\nYou know the theme of economics last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm\nAt the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one going back to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go all those trips and then the coach doesn't favor Evan play um\nI think there's a trickle down effect from there there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to bear itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues\nSo I look at these factors the industrialization mass incarceration as suburbanization so the industrialization lack of tax base we notice no funds to what construct and maintain ball fields\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh I\nProbably in high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm\nDo that that core slows gonna make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah\nSo I was like no not going to do that so instead you did was it American studies at American studies when journalism right in journalism which just shows how easy what I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing football [laughter] no I um\nI enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nFor football and I say I want to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you are given up during the course of your life\n\nYou shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he's still feeling the after\nOf his single minded and\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid at a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends including family and and then\nI was like All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting\nI mean I think it's a feeling of loneliness honestly which\nAnd it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but\nThroughout my life I have been almost myopic Lee focused on a goal which being focused on that goal like gave me purpose and I'm sure I'm going to butcher the maid she quote but it's something to the effect of\nA when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like I was\nDidn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I\nWas single focus on doing everything every decision I may well All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I ... the people who I was close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has\nA bunch of family and friends friends that she's been close with since they were in the second grade and like and I'm like yeah\nI don't really

grow to be an analogy I thought you know I think people were already angry\nBut the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled\nA lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh uh left that was already I quite exercised particularly ... particularly women\nAnd I on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections

see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll\nAll suck it up he'll suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the

make it work let me let me ask this have\nAny of the justices said anything publicly about this not per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we live in\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep her relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies

life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you are of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought intense racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAssets and then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that defined what what is it challenges you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite all

Congress and American politics for very long time as senator stood\nAt their desks informally voted on cabin on vice president Mike Pence presided protester after protesters stood up and yelled raw visceral messages stir mansion [noise]\nCircles has been seen some of it having a confirmation a Senate taking on one of its most important in historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural reckoning with sexual assault before the vote majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer sounded like they were in agreement the road\nThat led us here has been bitter angry and partisan\nA vote to confirm drug Scott without today as a vote to end this very dark chapter in the Senate history\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged and agreed but for very different reasons Republicans sock character assassination old unproven allegations designed to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation when the grand diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations some ... best\nI Would never do to them what you've done this guy this is an ethical sham since I've been in politics\nLike New York's Kirsten Gillibrand

on whether women are believe when they report harassment or assault\nWe allow women's experiences and sexual trauma second one man's promotion not only diminish this watershed moment a societal change we are as it will bring shame and this body um [noise]\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor Ford's sincere testimony I Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence though that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked awful lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out even pass from sweeping bipartisan governing bells\nBut while they differ on the root cause of what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage Republican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh\nAt the legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation a moral obligation to do better than it\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirm Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election\nVote if you believe Dr Ford and other brave women who came forward and you want to vindicate their sacrifice vote\nRepublicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post the whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh\nFor energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle there's about a month left to election day the big question now is which parties voters will still be angry about confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a nonpartisan body um how do you think he will be received finds new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives\nI like to refer to this as a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're at Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of a terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress a it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions and I suspect\nThat the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for civil future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin out of places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the court swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look\nLike I'm closely contested cases you will see a\nCourt that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina

described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence how it was attributed to God I just said you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be\nBecause this story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can never know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town or\nBirth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate to choose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in transracial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what is it challenges you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white Americans\nI really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge and if I tell them they might not understand anyway because

investigators that Washington Post contributor ... was killed inside the Saudi constantly has ratcheted up regional tensions\nThe Saudis have strongly denied the allegation NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul now to sort through the story I'm good morning Hi Lulu\nIt's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know democracy Yogi walked into the Saudi conflict Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating to a pending marriage to his Turkish fiance a she waited for him outside holding his phone until well after the consulate closed ah says he never came out\nA Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record budgeted budgeted president ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate are aired on says he's saddened that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far\nWe haven't seen any evidence to back up this claim that showed used it just a persistent question if\nHe's still alive where Izzie\nYeah what if the Saudis and saying well\nThe Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that they show you did come into the consular Tuesday Afternoon or the Saudi press agency quote officials saying he left the consulate\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News they're very keen to know what happened to him a there is no evidence on the outside whoever to show that show that you actually did leave the consulate\nThe consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of ... you said the consulate has multiple exits but why would they show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting up front\nSo lots of questions this advisor to president air to one says he's convinced to plane loads of Saudis who arrived in this stumble on Tuesday the same day could show you went into the consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of the show the either inside or leaving the counts\nAll right two questions in the first one is um why is this important what does this mean for Saudi relations with turkey and with other world powers well\nIt could be very important but a lot will depend on what we learn from here on about the show these disappearance what happened to him that seems likely to be further blow to Saudi turkey ties are relations were already strained Turkey's been siding with another Persian Gulf states Qatar and a bitter dispute with the Saudis are some are wondering what the American response is going to be\nA ... an important ally to the U.S though is turkey has so far officials are said only they're aware and following the

before the final cabinet vote in fact the president watched it from air force one you were there Tam what was the reaction on the plane\nYeah he wanted the reporters who were on the plane to watch him watching the final tally come in and he gave a thumbs up\nAfter that he took some questions and a reporter asked him what message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that\nWhat happened [noise]\nAnd I think that's sort of\nWomen I feel we're in many ways wrong so\nA lot of women that are suffering from\nThat to an echo of something that he said at a rally last week at\nIn Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory and Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that that turn that rally really helps push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed and talking points across the Republican spectrum tickets to the rally of this isn't your first Trump rally and we've heard so much about how important the Supreme Court is to rank and file Republicans was that a parent in the crowd with these rallies notably happier and more satisfied than Trump's crowds pre Kevin\nWell they definitely seemed to be in a good mood but here's something that I found really fascinating when President Trump talked about Kavanaugh they cheered when President Trump talked about how terrible the Democrats are\nThey went ... wild here is just an example of
