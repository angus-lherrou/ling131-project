we're seeing\nHow I get is hyper efficiency new business models the kind of disruption that came with the digital revolution and we're now seeing in the physical world\nI think they're often talk

in the solar energy space and ... and tend to what happened to the tide stumbled on what's happening in the price and when that faster than\nPeople expect at those high shifts half the current issue is is that part\nYeah totally 'cause the east cost reduction curves are perhaps most visible\nWith renewable energy Eighteen years ago the best projections\nFor wind energy word that the world would be able to install thirty gigawatts by twenty ten we've now beating that a goal by Eighteen times over\nAh sixteen years ago the best projections were on solar is that the world would be able to install a one gigawatt per year by twenty ten ... ten arrived I beat that goal by Seventeen times over last year they beat at Ninety eight times over\nAll and ... this exponential curve is still a getting deeper and deeper and moving up faster and faster the number of\nPV cells installed\nA the cost has been coming down dramatically are already here in the United states there are five times\nAs

put out a press relax [laughter] short [laughter] I\nGot a little bit in the morning and then of course we're going to have the main delegation has ah people from around the world during the Columbus

have been delivering system will be carbon based or not polite about ... emerging markets and the optimism that he might have found that to me\nYeah well the analogy that I have often used I think it is a a way of understanding how this works and that is to cell phones\nAre in Nineteen eighty I'm a TNT\nAsked McKenzie to estimate how many of those first generation cell phones they can sell by two thousand and the answer came nine hundred thousand when in the year two thousand arrived I did sell nine hundred thousand of them in in the first three days of the year\nI Am forty years a whole hundred twenty times and he says [laughter]\nAnd and there were three reasons why they were way wrong way or the cost came down much faster than anyone expected even as the the technology improved dramatically there'll be another round of improvements I read in the press at least that apple has another announcement tomorrow\nOr what's the third reason for this huge\nExplosion in the use of mobile phones is that the ... the majority of the people in the world lived in areas that had no land line telephones grits so they leap frog\nAnd now you have places in East Africa for example that make large\nA more intensive views of banking by phone and all kinds of services or by phone cutting company I'm coping has sold five hundred thousand or\nI get to the editor here at talk at lunch and found that over and ... that's going on you know hiring because they're still for your guest activity\nYeah yeah or if you look at it on a global basis\nOr taxpayers around the world are being required to subsidize the burning of fossil fuels\nAt a rate thirty eight times\nGreater than the meager subsidies for renewable energy\nIn the U.S too it's not as bad as that I think it's twenty four time okay as much and and this is of course manifestly of absurd ... or ... and ... if you if you look at\nWhat we're we're treating the atmosphere is an open sewers where half hour says as most people realize the atmosphere\nThe sky is not a vast limitless expand system extremely narrow shell surrounding the planet and we're putting a hundred and ten million tons of manmade heat trapping gases into that shell\nAs if it's an open ... or do we tell people oh you have millions of tons of of ah the toxic gaseous ways to harm broke out yesterday is waste just dump it in the sky we don't care uh no charge about ... you know will bump dumped out on\nThe environmental effects are now all these and future generations so yes that ought to be included in the metrics by what was that we use to measure the value of decisions of the choices that we May of course\nYeah yeah and in fact I got to hire and they're not really sure\nSame boat chest I think so important for me to say I read on that\nSame boat chest I think so important for me just say a little bit about\nScene or a cat you know\nA parent can track record and they were having hurricane picture here when hurricane wind have on the climate\nChair okay uh well first of all the before you even get to the hurricanes have there been any fires in California this year are you know the Mendocino Complex fire was the largest far in the history of California\nUh that fire tornado or at wars of half a mile across up the base than the one thousand four hundred degrees hundred and sixty mile hundred and forty mile an hour winds\nAnd every year the record is broken here and now the drought and the four corners region I mean I can go through the list but let's just talk for a second about Hurricane Florence says on the way\nIt is crossings all part of the Atlantic ocean where the temperature of the water is three and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal\nSo it has intensified at a record or near record rate it's up to a cat for they think it's going to get into a category five or ... and so\nThe number of hurricanes are so iconic storms hurricanes typhoons ... around there all the same thing they have different names like an ocean basins or the ... the absolute number doesn't increase the number of big ones increases dramatically\nAnd one reason is as the water is warmer the convection energy drives the wind speeds or to to much higher level and the warming now goes down in the ocean Ninety percent of the\nHeat trapping every day goes into the oceans and it's now penetrating deeper than two thousand meters so hurricanes as they approached the land instead of turning up the cold water are in short short cutting the conviction energy\nWhen the water is hot all the way to the bottom then they just keep on building in strength so that's that's one thing I can see level was already higher so the storm surge is greater and here's the other factor that you\nWill see play out on the news if the if the projections by the meteorologists are are correct\nThey normally the northern hemisphere jetstream moves to weather systems across the north American continent but as we saw with Hurricane Harvey last year in Houston, Texas\nOr the jet stream has been getting much one way of ear and episodic clean disorganized thing\nAnd so we get these periods where weather systems just are locked in place for multiple days in a row of last year and in Harris County Texas party which came around much warmer water\nOr it stayed there for five days and if you think your mind about Niagara Falls and how giant they are\nFive hundred and nine days worth of the full flow of Niagara Falls ... was dumped in five days on Texas and Louisiana\nAnd in Harris County though it got up to the the five feet of rain\nAnd they're talking now thirty inches to say I predicted for parts of the Carolinas because again if you look on the news every night on the TV news I say this all up and is like a nature right through the book of revelations a ... and [noise]\nAnd you know often the news media doesn't connect the dots what people are saying whoa this is unusual or ... and\nThey're now predicting that this is Hurricane Florence has not only going to be a massive hurricane and drop and an enormous amount of rain but is that it's going to stay there for days at a time and the south eastern quadrant extending over the ocean as Hurricane Harvey did last year\n... continues to replenish the moisture\nIn the storm we got five percent more humidity in the in the atmosphere of the earth day than in Nineteen eighty\nLook cause we're we're disrupting the water cycle that's one of the bases of life by a dramatically increasing the amount of water vapor coming off the ocean end of the sky so we get these rain bombs\nOr like the one after the fire ... in Santa Barbara last year at it and they got a rain bomb and that that led to the mudslide so there are multiple factors are underway at the same time and we've only mentioned a few of them but look\nAt some point we have got to collectively say uh we can go on like this\nThe scientist predicted years ago what Hurricane Florence the phenomena that Hurricane Florence is that the fact\nThat the scientists were right on almost everything they predicted about the climate crisis decades ago\nShould cause us to pay a little more attention to what they're saying will happen in the future if\nWe don't get our arms around this and start the carbon icing the global economy at a very rapid rate and bracing this sustainability revolution and creating a world that we can say to our kids and grandkids\nThis is the best we can do we did not close our eyes and we did not turn away we are all the way we are alive we're paying attention we're going to do the right thing\n[laughter] [noise]\nI ...\nTwo major ways and many laughing expect her accidents on the line there\nWay you express your activism lawn is true that the nonprofit we just talked about which is very flash all around the world and two is really a starting out and running out of a very successful for for profit standing ... investment\nA operation will be discussing the importance of good private capital so not only go out\nThat more and more investors really care about using their investment dollars and you're in contact your\nYour insurance on the ... you know who who's managing or ... ... the the amount of money that's allocated in decisions in the private sector is they've asked multiple of all the money allocated them in government budget\nGovernments have to play the leading role and I'll say that again we bought the private sector and particularly the investment sector\nOf a can play a crucial role in navigating this this shift toward sustainability absolutely so everybody can be involved you know in their personal lives and in their economic lives and their political wash and you hear\nThat basically a\nLarge percentage of investors about three quarters are actually talk about the state in the ... one of their ... or ...\nAnd I'm not allowed to save and hire\nMore than ... percent [laughter] so so it's really in a partner to know that the activism that you demonstrated in both parts of the political mobilization making phone calls training people to go out and do crafts for an organization is also being max by\nA flow of interest and dollars from private investors\nBoth of those things possible\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWe've just heard from former vice president Al Gore he\nWas in conversations with economists large Tyson UC Berkeley after the break my co host ray Suarez will sit down with two grassroots leaders to discuss strategies used and\nAnd that's what we see all over the world and we see it in this country as well that within the United states low income communities communities of color are the ones\nNext to the poll projects the fracking wells pipelines and are the ones who are on the front lines of impacts and so this is a story about\nClimate change impacting the poor impacting people who have very little with which to respond\nHaving said that there is a tremendous amount of organizing and resilience in these very same communities this is a story about people rising up and doing everything that they can but the risks are very big\nBut a young person listening to this program with let's say twenty eight twenty nine years which they look I'm not a shareholder on not accompanied director what how what influence there was a young person really have\nWell I can think of three things right off the bat that young people are doing and can do and you know I'm not making these up I'm watching it happened in the form I very eyes the first is young people as participants in our democracy and and democracy is all over the world\nWho vote about climate change who see this as an issue fundamentally about their future and they see it connected to other issues they care about about justice and about economic justice as well\nAnother thing young people can do is they mobilize and we see this over and over again I remember the first time I went to a United Nations climate conference I was still young enough to be in the youth delegation when we were T shirts that said how old will you be in twenty fifty\nAnd the idea was to convey that the people in negotiating we're not going to see the worst effects of climate change and we were trying to point out do this for the next generation do this for your children and your grandchildren now of course that's changed we're seeing these impacts in our lifetime\nBut that was an incredibly powerful action that pushes decision makers to take more political courage\nAnd the third thing I Would say is communication and storytelling and young people are right now the masters of social media a lot of the stories that are dominating um news cycles young people are helping consume that media and shape the stories and\nThat is another way that young people are not taking this crisis sitting down but this this is not this dynamic of giving up what can I Do this is so serious\nWe seen this in social movements throughout history and if people give up if people gave up over struggles for civil rights for suffrage\nFor the right to vote the right to\nLive in a non segregated society where would we be today so I think it's it's a similar situation with young people on the climate crisis they uh they see their risks they're motivated and when I talked to young people I always start by saying\nI Would be incredibly frustrated if I were getting involved in this movement right now and my hat is off to you for your commitment given the political challenges we face\nNone of the urban urine Indonesian island of memories of chain of islands were very large population thousands of those islands are small enough to actually be threatened with being you know indeed do Indonesians\nDo people know Malaysia or do people facing this uh actually think you have things I Do\nCan make a difference to what happens downstream\nThough now I live in the United states but I keep my a connection to my sisters and brothers in Indonesia\nAnd um this is our uh issue but climate change is a global issue but uh we are impacted locally\nAnd I think ... ... s Indonesians we see ourselves as a very a quiz show\nA ... a ticking crucial role as well as a strategic so\nLast year we started to have this campaign on Frank to\nPilot a thousand mosques using solar energy so not just the moms for example talking about protecting the earth in the mosque from the book that but also people and community started to see\nThat is a solar panel in my ... and then they take a price on it and then we can use that as a mode of education or two people and I think like\nEach individual king can a take on their own uh actions are a lot of people are told me that oh I'm just a one percent I cannot make a difference but I said flip it on another way even a small steps that you do\nA little won't fly that into ... million ten million a hundred million\nAnd if you see that it's like you know if like millions of people doing the same thing like you is that it's going to make a difference and people start to say yes that is you know like that is a scale so that's the spirit that we want to bring two people\nSpirit that we want to bring two people that they're not just one person that we are on this boat together and we will work together to make a difference and we're supporting each other so\nUh I think I Am very hopeful I think because I'm from uh the faith communities hope is the the thing that the fate can offer\nTo all of this devastation that we are facing at this time\nI think one of the toughest parts of this conversation is to imagine what equity looks work\nNon us from a part of the world with tremendous aspirations they want to live the way they see people in a imported movies and TV shows living they want the good things when you open up the door of an apartment or a house to have the things that they see\nA other people in the world having and then they find old now now we're gonna have to have a simplicity movement before you guys get rich we got rich by getting the dirty for a century\nBut now now that we're already rich we're going to say okay now it's time for simplicity that's a tough sell to the young people of the rest of the world isn't it\nYou're exactly right and\nHere I'd like to point out that that aspect one of the worst of impacts of Trump pulling the U.S out of the Paris Agreement is our commitment to the green climate fund and a commitment to actually support the transition off of fossil fuels and supporting adaptation to climate change for countries in the global south so\nThat's just one example of many\nWhere we see these inequities play out and I agree with you visualizing what this looks like\nRequires a lot of imagination and I think that people doing most of that imagination are the frontline communities are the people who are trying to figure out what is address transition actually if we recognize the severity of climate change\nWhat does that mean in our community what does that mean for the kind of jobs that are created what does that mean for people who currently don't have a job and the only job available is building a pipeline\nAnd trying to visualize that there is examples right here in the bay area in Richmond, California of people trying to live into this equitable future\nNone of them and how do you talk about these things to the millions of youth in Cairo in Kuala Lumpur in Jakarta\nIn the southern islands of the Philippines how do you say well now that the world has been filled up with carbon\nBy France and Britain and Russia and the United states now we're going to come to your parts of the world are under threat\nAnd say look or you're just not going to be able to live in that wasteful dirty way that people lived fifty years ago or six years ago while they were getting rich\nClimate change is not just an economic issue or political issue or even scientific issue but it's also like\nA moral and ethical crisis we need to put that on the table first that uh we hear that climate change is moral issue or ethical issue so that we would they use in the global south or in the developing world that\nThe being bombarded every day with pictures and you know like all these films like a like try to live like they're\nThey're ... years in the northern or develop worlds then we need to really sit together like all these use like I must have this idea that that we can have\nBuilt this a solidarity together that\nWe want the future or to look different not like what the you know like the former generation has been developing this world before but when you want as younger generation to create our own future\nThat we want like may sat equity so that young people need to be on the table to talk about equity what kind of equity they won\nI'm On freakonomics radio [laughter]\nCatch it Saturday afternoon at three and again Sunday Morning at four right

headed to the U.S Supreme Court judging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it that is expected to submit to conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good money but now we can both named conservative justices Souter Stevens black men Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact generations good\nOh yes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents do named to Bush and now to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who has been which has been growing for some of the court for years and swelling presence on the federal bench that it's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society especially as they are going to be um more prominent but never in us life\nI don't think we've got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars\nOf people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations asking the question of whether or not\nThe basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let's underscored there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about

expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome entry enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nI don't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the\nRight thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it doesn't look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to\nThe Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're messing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate this\nDid did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to for or the Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically to the crowd I wasn't aware of the fact because she was ... well so she had basically to these corporation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... she\nPeople they're basically shootings of cooperation were her therapists notes which it seemed to say let's she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things\nUpshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses who contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\nBut let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's energy from Christian Bussey Ford a sincere uh but that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support for at a judge\nNow the world from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo content you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible [noise] um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying he was just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews stir Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all that's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved some\nPeople you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth um\nIt's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what caf no winter Megan McCarthy thanks so much thank you [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hippies witness now to talk about some of the allegations jumbo Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course you should check it out of their Bloomberg convenient Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily that had heard of this one I I don't think that the news though\nI think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nWhen when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing for low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty barren that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] ... is there anything that you did you can recognizing that maybe people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\n[noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when Fred Trump and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they use and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending an equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it mostly may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts

is the only Senate Democrat who plans to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court today\nThis despite what we can imagine to be the objections of his fellow Democratic senators and what we know to be some very vocal objections of protesters gathered at the Capitol Taylor Wilson is one of those protesters results way west Virginian and founder of the women's activist group\nBoss babes in that state as Wilson thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me and what's your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for judge Kavanaugh\nDevastating but it's honestly not safer surprising\nYeah well yeah that it's been indicated also\nI mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator Manchin is just reflecting the Democratic we'll expressed by the people of West Virginia\nI I did think that he is the poll showed that cabinet people mostly most people at the party Kavanaugh here however I I think he did it entirely politically if it catches up for reelection and thirty days and he gets under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician ... that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did I say I\nSay well tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we get so we had a group of women I heard that in his office I I ... and they were actually arrested hit it on in Iraq that they sat outside now I think had they had a cop at college at my day\nThat did it really got wow sorry Thursday we had a group of about fifty got to see if we had um two separate occasions that first one we had\nProbably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we tell stories that\nSexual assault and asking how I practice out and he had a way he he was very engaged in the conversation to get out of the fact\nThat you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he

at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done a terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big\nProponent of the opioid crisis and so you kind of early I Believe and opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and he's just a bad guy and I think he knows exactly\n... so this is old your opinion let me underscore\nThat of course this is my opinion yes of course um so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well\nWell it does continue or yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things just got a constitutional amendment on the ballot jets banned abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if you're if you're sounds as if you have accepted senator mansions votes for what it is and I'm Still support among a great many issues and I got a job you're there's some very civilized in democratic me\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has it has I think the I think Morsi's worst choice

much\nThink yeah the protests on Capitol Hill coming years since the advent of me too movement started with Harvey Weinstein many actresses models employers and others who said that he had sexually

thousands of sexual harassment reports that come in only a fraction get funded for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time so some of those ... out of time\nSome of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's

on a show one of the great rivalries in sports a Yankees Red Sox the Sox won last night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox did the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because\nThis is exactly what these teams aren't the red Sox have the better starting pitching the Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up there at Yankees had chances in sixth living bases loaded\nBasis lives in the seventh inning and if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic\nUh Houston Astros but the crunch on Cleveland seven to two court club or a great pitcher got clue or club at you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and they gave me the Yankees won a hundred games but the actual still won a hundred but they went under and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beach you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like champions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves\nAnd yeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the play offs by Tuesday night\nAnd you forget that but now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy here and and we're talking about\nThe brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball and let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knocked him out well the Dodgers have a nationally chimps they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm at the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing\nAnd they've got the rocks already on the road yeah merit\nTo that and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I I really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFind that we need to mention a twenty games just pension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit

headed to the U.S Supreme Court\nJudging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it at is expected to submit to conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we can both name conservative justices Souter Stevens Blackmon Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation Brett Kavanaugh could have impact generations good\nOh yes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named to Bush and out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the

House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society especially as they are going to be um more prominent but never in us life\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars\nOf people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two judges generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let's underscored there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nUm if Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get up to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment it ended up feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction

C. foundation dot org and from the listeners of Kiki weedy\n\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon Brett Kavanaugh seems to be on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome entry enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian blessing for it now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nI don't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do\nThe right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with that and looked to possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it\nTo the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations\n[noise] um and also for you even if you think he didn't do it well you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you\nWant to first of all make sure that there is not something you're messing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate\nAfterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate that sit did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nTo Ford or to Kavanaugh um some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being on cooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... she'd\nPeople basically shootings of cooperation were her therapists notes which seemed to say look she talked about this other not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contact with the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\nBut let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bus you Ford a sincere uh but that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support Frank a judge\nNow the world from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few which you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points and then ... neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all that's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise] um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what caf no winter\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise]\nTo\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations just jumble Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is your jacket of bitter Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth for about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nWhen when Donald Trump ... over the years I've dealt with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan the money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale is his dependence on his father was really laid pretty barren that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is set on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\nI'll swear that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] ... is there anything that you that you can recognize and that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when Fred Trump and his wife Mary transfer a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggest that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it mostly may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president's the most about it when I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own\nTo grow up somebody because it puts that person had a power disadvantage that has a larger impact on that person's career trajectory\nRebecca Traister joins me next time on the New Yorker radio\nNow underway this morning

West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator mantra news just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that mostly most people supported Kavanaugh here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he has under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician is though that's not much of a surprise visit to I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did it out to him yesterday on\nThursday we'll tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a hit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday\nThat didn't really go while on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of\nSexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he said our way he he was very engaging the

believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that it's reflected in this decision\nThere's you're probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers\nAre fight does continue to sell uh as far as the Senate go he ... he kind of knew that he had us he kind of habits because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done a terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of\nThe opioid crisis and so he kinda sure doesn't believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and he's just a bad guy and I think he knows the\n... so this is your opinion let me underscore\nThis is my ... of course this is my opinion yes of course um so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well\nWell it does continue or yeah so we're working on um we're working at a statewide to change things just got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joanne just that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if it sounds as if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and I'm Still support among a great many issues and I got to tell you there's some very civilized and democratic to me\nI'm trying

celebrate on your home field and yet you sound great\nOh thank you Alison all her show one of the great rivalries in sports a Yankees Red Sox the Sox won last night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down and obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season\nAnd last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because\nThis is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching the Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded\nBasis lives in the seventh game and if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic\nUh Houston Astros but the crunch on Cleveland's seven to two court club or a great pitcher got clue or club at you like this throws a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and eight games the Yankees won a hundred games\nBut the actual still won a hundred but they went under two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they to stretch shut up against the Atlanta Braves\nYeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series\nHad the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the play offs by Tuesday night and you won't forget that but go ahead now I've just saying that it's it's a crazy here and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knocked him out well the Dodgers have the national league champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you you have a problem with that I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the road yeah merit to that and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but\nSponsorship of the cake you read
