Colombia\nAnd Gregory Winter at the MIT laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals and enzymes by inserting an element of randomness fringe of the whole process so it used to be\nAn element of randomness of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzymes to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith\nDeveloped a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibiotics that's what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how\nDid that practically change our world well you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies

been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy like the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination app eventually Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process and then how does it affect their legacy or not\nWell out of a hundred and sixty three nomination to the president has sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been concerned many on voice vote and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSome ways and means that it's not controversial and that at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty that Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense right ledge but by the way he was also the fish to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resign from his ship and went on to write books and make speeches than the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he

Nobel Prize week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in Stockholm\nComing out of touch with them in order to do this stuff to to let you know from the vent decision be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not going to end forbade them translate to ask\nYou to know who won so half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California\nAnd the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals and enzymes fighting searching an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are ... by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith\nDeveloped a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases I mean I just love that idea\nOf of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries\nHow did that practically change our world well you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process I mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster\nAnd you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies are in development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel are ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price sale\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years I'm surprised I can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know ... it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I

in east politics reporter guy Marcia erotic was the moderator and came in this morning to tell us how things went good morning guy who'd morning Brian so this is a race you've been following from the beginning tell us a bit about the two candidates and why this is a race to watch\nBuffy ... two candidates to Democrats from completely different ends of this party spectrum\nReally on display last night so where are you know was the organizer in the anti war movement who then went on to work for President Obama\nAnd Hillary Clinton ... a in the Bernie Sanders camp um you know who is a city council member on the Richmond city council the last question let's start there the last question they were asked last night was about politicians they admire and here's what they have to say\nOther there are many people that I admired and so the one that I have to say for you know laugh but certainly not least eyes Bernie Sanders well this is a pretty easy one for me I'm the man that I worked for for six years president rock of all I'm\nSo that you know chose you right away the split on on where they are in the party line I should say it tells you something about the audience last night that you mentioned Sanders got a huge applause the mention of Obama crickets and maybe even a few boos\nWow so is there an issue that you heard last night where the candidates really drew a stark contrast it has to be\nProposition ten so this is the statewide measure on the November ballot to expand rent control with allows cities to expend rent control and it has particular I think residents in the East Bay a district where you have three cities Berkeley Oakland enrichment with all have some kind of rent control in the books\nThese could be cities that expand a rent control policies if prop ten passes and it's a huge split between ... and where\nThat goes is basically tying her campaign to the passage of props and here's how she put it last night\n... ten is the way is the answer is the answer um\nTypically tying her campaign to the passage of props and here's how she put it last night\n... ten is the way at the end is the answer um so I guess that's a simple simple answer is I absolutely support it please vote for ... ten this November because the rent too damn high\nAnd in the case of wicks a you know earlier in the campaign she had said you know really nothing about crops and hadn't taken a position on it she's now against a proposition ten she said her reasoning for that came after conversations with affordable housing developers\nThey are concerned that this will exacerbate or housing crisis I think the construction of new homes and we desperately need new homes in California and\nSo she and in this issue which is more in line with Democrats like avenue some um who yeah who raised the issue of construction of ... definitely with the more liberal wing of the party who is pushing proposition ten\nSo both of these women have passion they are really immersed in the issues but what is the style\nDifference that you saw last night oh the style differences incredible and I think that that was certainly on display\nBeck will say you know in question after question uh her response was I'm tired of incremental ism on issues like cap and trade with the legislature dealt with last year bill reform which the legislature dealt with this year she said she would have voted against both deals um 'cause you know they weren't that the perfect\nI think both of you with us that you would have supported both because they at the end of the day were landmark reforms ah you know nationally um and that really painted a difference between the two\nAll right ... thanks so much for moderating as a resident of that district and also thanks for coming in to tell us about it thank you\n... and Buffy Wicks are part of the wave of women running for office in this political season in our series called the long run kick you eat he has focused on the challenges

EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall a Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh so contentious Senate hearing last week recall him earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who have been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination and eventually Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a hotly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process and that and how does it affect their legacy or not\nWell out of a hundred and sixty three nomination to the presidents and sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice vote and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have any means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a deserted been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to move Justice John rent legend to the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status if you use Mac\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justice is through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off to quit because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house of representatives said his wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\n\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION on ...

Republican leaders agree Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they are trying to deal\nAnd I think should probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he had a personal connection with allegations that he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of this\nAnd Republicans took great pains to not

at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them this honor so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals in the enzymes fighting searching an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzymes to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme I'm putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses the virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibiotics that is what Gregory Winter dad he took phage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part

I'm Brian watt\nThe two candidates in the competitive state assembly district Fifteen race based off last night in a debate in Berkeley\nKick you in east politics reporter guy Marcia erotic was the moderator in came in this morning to tell us how things went good morning guided morning Brian so this is a race you've been following from the beginning tell us a bit about the two candidates and why this is a race to watch\nBuffy ... two candidates to Democrats from completely different ends of the party spectrum\nReally on display last night so where are you know it was the organizer in the anti war movement who then went on to work for President Obama\nAnd Hillary Clinton drunk a ... a in the Bernie Sanders camp um you know who is a city council member on the Richmond city council the last question let's start there the last question they were asked last night was about politicians they admire and here's what they had to say\nOther there are many people that I admired and so the one that I have to pay for it you know last but certainly not least\nBernie Sanders well this is a pretty easy one for me I'm the\nMan that I worked for for six years president ...\nSo that you know it shows you right away the split on on where they are in the party line I should say it tells you something about the audience last night that you mentioned Sanders got a huge applause the mention of Obama crickets and maybe even a few boos\nWow so is there an issue that you heard last night where the candidates really drew a stark contrast\nIt has to be proposition ten so this is the statewide measure on the November ballot to expand rent control with allow cities to expend rent control and it has particular I think residents in the East Bay a district where you have three cities Berkeley Oakland enrichment with all have some kind of rent control and the books these could be cities that expand\nA rent control policies if prop ten passes and it's a huge split between ... and ...\nThat goes is basically tying her campaign to the passage of props and here's how she put it last night\nPop ten is the way is the answer is the answer um so I guess that's a simple simple answer is I absolutely support it please vote for ... ten this November because the rent too damn high\nAnd in the case of wicks a you know earlier in the campaign she had said you know really nothing about probably ten hadn't taken a position on it she's now against a proposition ten she said her reasoning for that came after conversations with affordable housing developers\nThey are concerned that this will exacerbate or housing crisis I think the construction of new homes and we desperately need you new homes in California\nAnd so ... and in this issue which is more in line with the Democrats like Gavin Newsom um who yeah who raised the issue of construction or ... with the more liberal wing of the party who is pushing proposition ten\nSo both of these women have passion they are really immersed in the issues but what is the style difference that you\nSaw last night oh the style differences incredible and I think that that was certainly on display\nBeck will say you know in question after question uh her response was I'm tired of incremental wisdom on issues like cap and trade which the legislature dealt with last year bill reform which the legislature dealt with this year she said she would have voted against both deals um because you know they weren't that the perfect\nI think ... a said she would have supported both because they at the end of the day were landmark reforms a you know nationally um and that really painted a difference between the two\nAll right ... thanks so much for moderating as a resident of that district and also thanks for coming in to tell us about it thank you\n... and Buffy Wicks are part of the wave of women running for office in this political season in our series called the long run kick you eat he has focused on the challenges

Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert for the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at eventually Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and the government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee found to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nomination to the presidents and sent to the Senate hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice vote and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have any means that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they're just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with\nThis confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status if you use Mac\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nWould be highly unlikely the way you remove it\nRemoved it would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justice is through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase in Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off to quit because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house of representatives said he'd wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\n'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons and that leads to another question", "show_name": "Morning
