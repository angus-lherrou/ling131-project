I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post darn glimpse falls he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up of makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM during the campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time\nGo up and what they thought was his middle aged man peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on a sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get the\nOther campers yet all four of them rounded up together and they were kind of standing and sunny circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen or killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get someone to tell you the trees and he started marching the kids off into the woods so come into the woods near Brooke compare the two with him behind them for the kids of\nCourse we're scared out of the woods he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed out um and then the last one he tied\nSo after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip\nDumb blue ski on because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening\nBut they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard soldiers voice\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing Douglas game with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times as much as\nWhen this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... ran to his car Carol and\n... he ran through the woods [noise]\nBottom demand caught one of them David Freeman she took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch\nNext to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying on the debt chapter of an hour and the men come\nMen that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and of a sudden they spotted dump a killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the mom screaming for help saying\nWhen they did Freeman got up and ran towards the demand screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and thus began what was at the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nThere was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower and through a roving patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifle shotgun bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday that two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods they eventually\nFind the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID\nEight thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape ... seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when people got panicked when you're all well when I'm at night the doors are large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says a man has dragged on what happened\nWas Carol was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named Taylor block spotted gal\nThese freeze or drop your gun something of that fact and Guerra started running\nLow block fire four times got 'em in the back the arm in the\nFoot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nThey took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there grilling him the whole\nTime because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's got nothing\nBut he wouldn't talk to this point that the story\nThat I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor at least ... is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation and we are recording\nAnd so the guy at the center of this conflict was\nA man named Frank Armani Frank age aren't many brand the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd you know whether to pronounce it or money or money that Mary Armani Frank's wife and there are some aid they use urban but it is money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York in Germany now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for\nRobert Carol I'm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk away\nHe was a fighter I liked ... fights ... flights like standing up for the little guy\nAnd that's partly why he became an attorney\nWhen you're fighting a case for defendants you're fighting this date and ... and he was doing really well he has well respected\nHad a good reputation but then he met rather\nGuerra yeah last year strongman to take him out you need a forty five and uh I just had that feeling this guy is dangers in love with things are going to happen\nThis is the year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank are members he represented in at first on two pretty small things wind won\nA schoolteacher headless cells to his child he was sued the school and I talk to them or do but and then he had an automobile accident I represent and that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\nWe kept pick for um let's see some younger\nAnd went into one bar where\nOne of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise] took of\nDriving that lady friends car to try to lose the tails\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this measure as far as\nWe walk up to the polls the band and my\n[noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and Tom supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father system a road that goes to the miners are what is your after their minds [noise] it was then sort of hilly area off the side of the road this\nTrail around or you're just\nVery icy that day this hair issues to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly feet are known leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that Iranian this is the only way they came here\nTo write up here we are in our son do suits and rebuild tragedy choose for is looking for\n[noise]\nYou spent another ... works book [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this when her friend well\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this has given any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down and there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nOr you could see or sneak the shoe\nYou could see or sneak the blue shoe simply sneakers [noise]\nLike I said to myself this soon which does it end he yells back up to algae get me outta here\nWe'll meet back up\nEventually algae found the body Alicia how study she's in a cemetery where they had sent he left but our money wasn't that with ...\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options sure so option what we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nEasier missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took you know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules\nWhich ship developed quite a bit since the time this happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client is\nUnder the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain gas were substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that does it yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened waking up but even if they hired detectives and he is a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if\nPeople are already dead then you ... the the lawyers\n[noise] that's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a different slant you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs kids to play the part of the system in which you are the one he stands up for the guy that everybody else [noise] even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for the client\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of plant or also citizen and a member of the ... I've heard of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder mystery here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right as we each year building on on the side of tell just tell\nTell of course yes and I knew Mr ... from booming because his older daughter my daughter was in the same slash and I knew from church June\nOne has to be and then a few\n... the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\n[noise] so now what is coming up that hard spot it's even harder [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nHi excuse me for me from Arlington, Texas radioactive supported in part to affect the sunshine Asian enhancing public understanding of science and\nTechnology in the modern Ron monster mensch not flown WWW dot ... dot O.

I'm I'm Roger I'm rubber ... which is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer bena feral and when we left it they were where they were stuck right\nA story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they've found the bodies of two girls and a no brainer what is it what it was their next move wild\nSo they decide to\nPlead bird plea bargain they take this information to the prosecutor and say I have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes\nAnd in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my clients get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a person also right away they're going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her little and you're going to take a little\nWell that's kind of gross oh yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank's perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Andrew McCabe investigator from the state police detective located in the district attorney armies office and when they met army and bell gee search the briefcase was up to be a an investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some type sort of bug and then a Dell gee presents the deal he says lesson I've got information on two bodies\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is that you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nThey told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and they were\nPossibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job\nMm Mm [noise] I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a\nGood body is case time all schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if you will face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp I agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can see in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer she should be\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThe from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the\nFamilies involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victim\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and okay\nOkay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing washing camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and don't do something in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it's that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the content of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nAre 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd it was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling of the ... that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and dog when we were there\nSitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we received a phone call that they are nice my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to the ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months\nOf horror and [laughter] and that's what they taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when\nApproached us it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the family than to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine\nWhat they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's that's why I was hoping\nTo talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to get some of that um experience yeah well it's impossible to\nReally communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I ... ... ... it's a struggle to it because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't know I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of um side stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know when you don't have to think\nWell what can I say she was she did receive heard they're great pets too much sleep I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University too difficult for us\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had just that summer and he had a full scholarship any uh graduated just before and so to and I'm sure the other children get\nGreat future and it's just horrible tragedy it\n\n\nIt's a horrible you know to be in their position\n[noise] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter no more than what excuses for protecting the person that killed her no justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's where it is [noise]\n[laughter]\n\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's OK\n\n\nOkay can you hear the echoes of dogs down the mountain things tend to travel up the up the hill and kind of bounce around um water I think it's\nSome deeper down in their caffeine I Can't tell when it's drifting everything up here it's frozen solid sounds true what that is [noise]\nBut I think I'm going to turn back around [laughter]\nKick you eighty eighty eight point five San Francisco and ... eighty nine point three north highland Sacramento and streaming online at ... dot org [noise]\nSo are we in the trade war yet well defined a trade war and they'll give you the answer for the past several months for the United states has been trying to gain some leverage with its trading partners the president slapping new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports\nFrom America's closest neighbors and allies sometimes gets a bit rough Canadians\nPolite we're reasonable but we also will not be pushed around for a few weeks ago a new trade deal struck with our polite Canadian friends in Mexico\nWe have successfully completed negotiations\nOn a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA\nAnd the NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nMalls us MCA sort of just working families [noise]\nBut the aggressive trade renegotiations have continued especially with America's biggest frenemy\nWe can't continue to allow China to rape our country and that's what they're doing their greatest them in the history of\nChina is imposing new tariffs on us that today after President Trump put tariffs\nTwo hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nHere's what the Chinese trade negotiators that\nIt's hard to negotiate with someone when he puts a knife\nI'm no expert but\nThat kind of sounds like a trade war\nRegardless of whether or not we already know full blown trade what I think not a full blown trade war\nI think the first shots or had been fired clearly\nThe modern global economy requires a delicate balance which countries collaborate on trade while simultaneously competing against one another\nThis competition often requires a referee to make sure everyone's following the rules that referee is this man\nMy name is revert to a video I Am the director general of the world trade\nOrganization or since to any sort of teen\nAnd would you describe the director general rule of the WTO as essentially a diplomatic wrote the diplomatic role of the uh a director general\nIs the one that he has to perform as a as a building roads bridges he

Organization was founded only in Nineteen Ninety five but has its roots in Britain woods conference in Nineteen forty four which also gave rise to the world bank and the international Monetary Fund\nThese institutions were set up to help resuscitate and grow the post war global economy\nBut the political timing wasn't right for a global trade organization instead of an agreement between twenty three countries called the general agreement on tariffs and trade was signed in Nineteen forty seven when the number of signatory countries reached a hundred and twenty three the agreement was ... and given more teeth\nWith the establishment of the WTO its mission is to quote\nEnsure that trade flows smoothly predictably and freely as possible but in recent months global trade has become quite a bit less news and much less predictable with the U.S threatening or enacting massive tariffs against a variety of countries and industries\nWith retaliatory tariffs quickly following that's where we begin the conversation with Roberto as a beta we spoke a few weeks ago I was in New York and as a beta was that WTO headquarters in Geneva [noise]\nSo we are in a particularly\nNoisy a trade environment at the moment it in the headlines all the time\nConsidering the threatened than actual terrorists emanating from the U.S or in considering the U.S role in the global economy what share of your time currently I'm is taken with issues that concern directly or indirectly the U.S\nOr you're talking about the largest economy in the world so it's natural that a lot of my time or we'll have some kind of relationship with our actions taken by the United states also because an accent that is taken by the United states has repercussions are everywhere\nAre across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time has to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from the sky in an ambient that was a a knock ripe and then found a direction that didn't that that was not there he is the result of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and or if you don't understand the forces that put him there I think that's part of getting the wrong diagnosis and I have to tell you there's a lot of sympathy for some things that are said or on the part of the United states\nThat are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO as opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that terrorists are really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where terrorists exists under a different name one of the U.S is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version and their their government subsidized their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar\nTo use the WTO have any ability to directly request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time industries like protection\nThey want to be supported by the government wants to get help and they are now seen this um a price in what we call behind the border\nProtection a and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient or enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because terrorists you can measure\nTerrorists you include only a spreadsheet and you prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board there measure you don't know when they come you don't know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a comedian a hearing the W. job would discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nAnd not really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding than what other countries apply and that would be for the protection of the consumer\nOr it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure but they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations to just stop trade altogether so that's or whatever and infant if they're if at the border slowly measured and [noise]\nThe WTO says the average tariff rate among its members fell by Fifteen Percent between organization founding in Nineteen Ninety five and two

discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\n[laughter] to be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage a some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are\nVery

the headlines and color the coverage of the upcoming midterm don't miss this week's on the media from WNYC\nOn the media comes up at two o'clock and then again at midnight and ... public radio\n[noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nRoberto ultimatum director general of the world Trade Organization was appointed to the post into thousands Thirteen when the trade waters were considerably less choppy than they are today [noise]\nSo you were from Brazil and you've studied electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here had those three factors Brazilian engineering\nAnd being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um\nWell the good thing about being a a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse perspective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural background\nAnd it has aspect of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife uh and uh she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a love story in its own rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering lake solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations were together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a constructive parts and a figure out a way to make them work\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn to kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that your forever learning how to ... relate to people how to take into account at diapers personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case for at least another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed countries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative relationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors into domestic economy will lose many gain a mini are better off with the with the trading relationship but that some news in the sense that they are not competitive enough sometimes\nSponsorship and the cake you eat the live stream banks than any firm Comcast extending the Internet to present home life high for all the right and the home\nI think what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for governments in for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies\nIt's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are ... are they have a role of course but the minor in this structural change and I think if we don't realize that and if we don't try to find a solution\nFor this will be hurting much more than the help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what's the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand uh the situation and reached the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\n... there is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so\nThere will be a need to rethink the whole educational system or in countries how to support the displaced are people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how old are you will help them\nOr find another economic activity that will work for them and to help them support their family\nThis is freakonomics radio with your host Stephen ...\nSo I wouldn't say that my pop economics was through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economists which one was definitely call them are\nThat's Mary Annette ... I'm a professor and the economics of the nation on public value at University College London\nYou also advised as far as I can tell a number of governments in governmental institutions\nShores I'm currently on the council of economic advisors for the first minister Scotland and also the special adviser for ... to their research commissioner and the European Union and\nI used to be on the advisory board offered Jeremy I'm corn and then I resigned because of\nIts share a special advisor to the secretary general of the CD is that right yeah\nSo the LAPD is currently rethinking its economic narrative and\nSo they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that a group\nGotcha and also um ... advisory panel in Finland is that\nTrue well yeah probably I didn't realize one of the whole it yes [laughter]\nThere's actually even like thirty more\nHow can it be the one university economist has heat Europe so many governments in institutions for a clue let's get back to why months of Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about mark is that he's known as a critic of capitalism but actually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic\nOf capitalism which is technological change we shouldn't forget that lives in was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is the fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of laws that it's constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution\nAnd consumption work and marks really talks about that quite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic\nOf always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological change\nBut it's not just technological change interests Mexico she has a relatively radical stance on the value that created by technological change\nWhat do I mean by radical stamps consider the titles of her books the first was called the entrepreneurial state [noise] those two words entrepreneurial and state typically are not used to gather\nMust have got his latest book is called the value of everything making and taking in the global economy when it comes to the relationship between government and economic growth Martha ... knows how to ... does\nIt goes like this my God the government would a basket case ... aircraft they don't know what they're doing\nBut she sees it differently you know what

family in London in an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T um where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine\nOr do you said well they're expensive one I saw that the glass of wine you ordered costs forty pounds\nI made an error they made an error you identify try this is how they treat you know they treat you they trick you I don't know because I was a woman and they didn't show me the price you know today gentlemen or if it's with us she does but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw and it turned out to be the most expensive one that\nGot anyone who read that article at the Columbia Sylvie ... social [laughter] right\nSo to someone who says you know free market or\nAlmost always good and governments are almost always bad and if somebody says that you say what\nThe first is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a you know ... one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFeet from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know we need less state I'm\nIn order to be more innovative more dynamic I say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the states with involved in almost everything a in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important to companies in that area but the role that public actors played was really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes exactly\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream thanks Sandy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nOr downstream doing applied research like a dark side but also with sister organization in more recent times called art they eat the national institutes of health which continue to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical uncertain high risk a research\nAnd there's some evidence of the government funding that much ... was talking about DARPA or the defense advanced research Projects Agency created during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet\nBecause over the years produce several kinds of missiles and airplanes as well as the first computer mouse miniature GPS receivers each do displays and the digital personal assistant ARPA e or the advanced research Projects Agency for energy found that under George W Bush\nHas funded a variety of energy projects including battery storage tech\nThe department of energy starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested more than a hundred and thirty million dollars studying the extraction techniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health is helped fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy\nThese public institutions have absolutely co created value is quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the copy Larry\nOn that one uses so instead of saying the public sector do you risk the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating and enabling business it's really about you know taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and clubs that government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in return how big of a problem is that\nSo it's a huge problem and it comes back to how we talk about things I often remind people um you know the play tone [laughter] you said that story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we tell\nAbout who creates value hasn't ... created the stories that are that justify the extraction of the value so let me give you an example which I think brings us home\nThe U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion\nDollars and part of that agenda was really also to direct that says go stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama finance some companies like a cylinder\nThrough the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nTheir new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder and make solar energy panels\nWhy does the taxpayer has to be the one footing the bill to try to shift some power solar power worse\nPeople said my God the government would a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of\nYou know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way on which first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of\nA U.S government financing early on but more concretely at the same time that it was financing cylinder and also finance Tesla for a very similar amount of money so they passed last car got a four hundred and sixty five million guaranteed loans\nAnd when I say guaranteed I'm Talking about guaranteed by the U.S taxpayer so until enderlin by the taxpayers we're\nPretty angry that they had to pick up the bill but why did the taxpayers not know that they had also finance tax law would not have changed the narrative and the perception of what these bureaucrats in Washington were doing they actually had a portfolio like any venture capitalists\nWhich you know takes on risk and so to speak to any a venture capitalist they will tell you that for every success there's many failures however if you really want to be an actor capital if you have to construct your portfolio in such a way that you also get some of the upside from the wins precisely to cover that downside\nDot org slash elections to find out [noise]\nYou're listening to kick you eighty eighty eight point five San Francisco and kick

years decades I or ten is also the spokesperson for this group\nShe says the key is to be realistic\nSo few southern objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in either in any of our lifetime [noise] um by breaking it down it's like eating an elephant you can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into pieces that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with medicine and they actually send teams of police officers and social workers\nTo help addicted homeless people\nIn Marysville, Washington ranger serious Peter forest next to a strip mall\nOfficer might fuel cracks jokes with some illegal

San Francisco and Kiki I north highland Sacramento the time now it's six o'clock\nThis weekend edition with special coverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference alive when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning ... [noise]\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we\nKnow is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime well\nIt is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is\nFacing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities\nSay the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a as a religious service was expected to begin on he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us Sarah ... there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern right\nI mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest is not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil like an eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um I\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun you know laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a ... a section of ... around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nOn and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\n[noise] I think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding [noise] yeah well you mentioned there will be\nA about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happened so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so that's just one small thing of the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout the community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far well\nIt depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nAnd it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life an unless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where they've been mass shootings in recent years the gift tax is that the actively carry out that's at sentences but unless the president is calling for that to be more of the conversation and\nObviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\n\nMorning I'm a doctor car Williams of the medical examiner chief medical examiner of the Allegheny county and again I Want to reiterate what everybody says so far which is weak in my office extend our deepest

grieving as you can imagine my colleagues and I joined the authorities and asking for you pleased to be respectful of ah the ah the needs of for the time and space as they deal with this tragedy uh\nToday in the coming weeks they will need to know the Pittsburgh supports them as a lifting them up like\n[noise]\nHi I'm Jeff Finkelstein I'm the president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh um\nJeff Finkelstein I'm the president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh um so I have to begin by\nSaying that I've seen this room a lot of times on TV and I never thought I'd be at the podium um\nThis is an awful awful period for a Jewish community and uh and especially for the families who have been affected and it's real when once you hear the names were going to do everything we can to help the families how we're in the process of doing that now\nAnd will be there for them and be there to help our Jewish community and the Pittsburgh region a heal from this\nI Want to echo a lot of uh thanks and gratitude that people have already expressed to local law enforcement types of the FBI\nI'm to the\n... army the red cross evolved been there with us yesterday at the jaycees be I Want to thank my colleagues at the Jewish community center and Jewish family and children's services especially for really stepping in to work with a with the families\nUm and um and you know we we will definitely get a ... who get past this and be a strong Jewish community like we've always been thank you and I asked the mayor to come up now\nMakeshift [noise]\n\nPittsburgh is a strong ... we are a resilient city oh we had been knocked down and we found ways to stand back up\nAnd we've always done it in one way or working together\nTo the victim's family to the victims friends we're here as a community of one for you we will be here to help ... protests horrific\nEpisodes will get through this dark is a day of Pittsburgh history by working together\nSquirrel hill is the most diverse neighborhood in all of western Pennsylvania people choose to live there because of the diversity of the community the Jewish community is the backbone is part of the fabric of Pittsburgh\nAnd we will be there in all communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nWe um [noise] as I said it had been knocked down before but we've always been able to stand back up because we worked together and I have to take a moment to think those that spoke earlier\nThe effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal to the state to the county to the local\nWas something that we should all be proud of the fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics were asked us to\nOur medics deciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from the surrounding counties\nThe federal agents in this state troopers and the county officers all working together in order to be able to make sure an episode\nThat will forever go down in the history of this city\nIs one of the worst moments that we have experienced was able to be less and because of that coordination into those that are standing behind me who spoke early earlier the professionalism that was exemplified through their leadership\nFor something that we needed as our darkest time [noise] to our officers who are in the hospital into one officer who's been discharge the\nThanks for the entire city you go to them their sacrifice and they're no end of the danger that they put themselves in in order to be able to protect others there's something when they put on that uniformed that we should understand\nThe sacrifice that they make to their family members of the city will be behind in there to support you in anything that you may need\nAnd finally to those that are not familiar with Pittsburgh\nTo those who have given a their words of not only confidence that support to Pittsburgh from around the world around this nation and around the state thank you we know\nThat we as a society are better than this we know that hatred will never went out\nThat those that tried to divide us because of the way that we pray or where our families are from around the world will lose\nIn Pittsburgh we're pragmatic and we find solutions to problems we will not try to rationalize the rational behavior we will not try to figure out ways in order to lessen the degree of crimes such as this we will work to eradicate it\nWe will work to eradicate it from our city from our nation in our world\nHatred will not have a place anywhere\nAnd we will work locally to make those changes happen and we'll work with partners around this country and around this world to make sure that it adds\nOne of the think again all of those in this room the elected officials who are gathered those that have worked on the front line of public safety those that worked with in public works in other parts of the government in order to be able to assure the safety of our people\nAnd will open it up to questions that this time\nA question this thought that was Mayor Bill de Vito ... you're listening to special coverage from NPR News and that was a press conference taking place in Pittsburgh related to the deaths of eleven people yesterday at the tree of life synagogue and we're joined now by Sam again and again who is in Pittsburgh\nSo we heard the names of those who were

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voter though that Tina voters are\nAny racial minority they're presented as a monolith black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about in terms of their varied interests and their very identities so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals are we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and that's one of the color or somehow the only ones who engaged in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nIdentity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is a default so I have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that side of whites me very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting this story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nIn the political implications of not being specific when we talk about white people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race or say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue with that issue\nAnd in fact what the research shows is that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why it's been invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people kind of clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago but white voters also hear the racial implications of that\nAnd so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations typically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then sent when you're trying to\nDiscuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\nWhen I was clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered\nThe election showed that by to be very glaring clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally where voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nThere were producers reporters and hosts of

steadily declined since deporting the country more than two weeks ago some of dropped out some state in Mexico and others have been deported she reports many have landed back in the place where the

when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric and also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we'll Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice trained the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo piece position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue was the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which all elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\n[noise] there is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders\nOh we've had moments of turmoil I'm thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what sets this moment apart in your view\nThe phenomena are we seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonizing hate Hillary voters and vice

I Want to turn to you now I'm the caravan of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum has been in the news is you know I'm you've actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration\nA so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect on how we as individuals view an entire group of people\nAbsolutely yeah so in in one recent study with Renee floors he's a\nSociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists\nAnd rape is coming from Mexico and Central America it's\nNot hard to guess what is driving this stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is that people who are anti Trump in general also absorbed this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we we have talked to a size we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chambers wherever consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservative held and yet\nThe mass exodus organized by activists in Honduras is the lead to be the largest migrant\nExodus organized by activists in Honduras if the lead to be the largest migrant caravan on record\nDominate the headlines and color the coverage of the upcoming midterm don't miss this week's on the media from WNYC on the media\nAt two o'clock this afternoon and midnight on kick you in the public radio\nI'm nowhere around with these headlines authorities this morning release the names of the people gunned down in a Pittsburgh synagogue yesterday\nThey range in age from fifty for two Ninety seven and included a married couple and two brothers of forty six year old man is in custody facing federal charges officials say the suspect had no criminal record but has posted anti Semitic posts on line\nPresident Trump has ordered flying said federal buildings throughout the country flown at half staff to show respect for the dead he condemned when they called an evil anti Semitic act\nAnd in baseball the Boston Red Sox beat the Los Angeles Dodgers nine to sex in the fourth game of the world series last night Boston leads the best of seven series three games to one I'm neuron NPR News in Washington\n\n...

I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks Sandy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nThis was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest assassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the president's in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this thought the president has\nMade a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil he has also gone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut just before\nA rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it and I'd have a much different tone frankly the press was even handed the press was fair I'd have a much different than all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there is what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is the president and who has not really embrace the role of United and chief no he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation\nBut he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energize his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race and fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you note midterm elections are just over a week away well the events of this past week affects the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson my thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case he's or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the ... the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge um CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how she became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding night life\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog\nOn Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand

will find on their ballots the governor's races the different kinds of ballot measures what we've just got today in one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at the too big a house and Senate will do the Senate first and we'll do it with NPR lead political editor to medical Martin our good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats in the Senate or up as the constitution requires Democrats are facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house then in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more seats that are held by Democrats in red states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats than\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential as best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd a more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of this cycle and through this cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscaping twenty Eighteen where they could go on often\nThe best target for Democrats as in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican or defense is a lot of those those Senate seats\nOr Arizona Tennessee Texas Nevada they all started to try and a little bit more Republican in recent weeks while Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp a are not looking so good Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrats are really really hoping that in Indiana Joe Donnelly can hold\nThat Jon Tester in Montana can hold and that Joe Manchin

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voter though the Tina voters are\nAny racial minority they're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters\nBut when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and their very identities so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default\nSo I have treated frequently that way we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voters I Need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that side of the white to me is very detrimental because we're centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also decide accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are\nGetting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise] well I\nThink one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race or say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focus say almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way ...\nHe really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnd the other way politicians may not explicitly say white but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so that's also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people kind of clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color if we'd had legal apartheid in this country and tell forty years ago but white voters also hear the racial implications of that\nAnd so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organization and specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then said when you're trying to\nDiscuss some of these racial divisions in this country\nWhen I was clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered\nThe election showed that by to be very very clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally well voters on the ground were saying right let voters on the ... no I haven't lost my job I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're cutting hearing to change our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know if they're talking about ... ... it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased but also when we talk about fairness\nIs it fair is it accurate\nTo say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white\nTo me that is not fair it's not fair\nTo all of the people in our country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and

thing that speaks these Frank Underwood once did so well he wants to talk about the difference between a useful andme useless paying but when she talks about our own pain she seems curiously
