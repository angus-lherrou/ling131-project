I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we might as well we're going to get it on the radio yeah so she got kids with the you may want to make someone on yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please try\n[laughter]\n\nSo ah December twenty seven a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young to middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that right there are you the organizers\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Steffi me\nWhat are you calling for\nNursing has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point [noise]\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken it themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise]\nThey want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this\nSmall peaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook one of the\nOpening shot Facebook triggered hordes now what would become a loud he faces but do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nEmbattled Facebook CEOs but today playing\nAnd global bad embattled Facebook CEOs book today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches [noise]\nBut but rather something that I think is a deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against roe kingdom Muslim what we can say in what we can't say that again by this on the subject of what we\nCan see and what we can see like Mueller right kids in front of me on\nThe air\n\nThank you Mr Cameron and Mr sacrifice I got to\nThe Houston jak differently prioritize or censor speech\nVanish woman who we don't they grumble for doing of censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAn diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow\nWhich made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch to just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees [noise]\nAll right ready so at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again\nKeep in mind this was in nearly two thousands seismic change this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path and ice\nMay not just now the most visited website in the U.S\nFacebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with the big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things that come up onto their screens flagged her to Facebook and\nI'm like meaning like I use or something that I thought was wrong exactly like our reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate clinics she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either [noise] naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou would turn near pod leader who was you know somebody who'd been around nine months longer than you and asked what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain that you were you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh well ...\nThey had a set of community standards that day at the end of the day they were just kind of this one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there one huge long\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad taken down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[laughter] rise up sites for the rights that Brett\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirror those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough\nThrough Facebook so to coincide with the life protest they just can't take up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual near sent two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nThe title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding it's not [noise] and it caught on social networking website is under fire for any problem the unfolding of women

building Dublin where we sent reporters Garrett stuck scene where the kids are ... used to treat everybody fever English and we sent them\nThere to try to talk to some of these people to for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around two million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like well\nI'm originally we\nFound out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting femi happening\nA lot about the good work advice [laughter] so now I don't have money you know sorry you work in but\nI Know you're lying in fact most people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they signed\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather that that is totally fine you know I'll just go I ... I don't want them\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they work for face\nThe impact that that's going to have our yeah until you got here so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he'd show up to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ... he\nJust I just I just like a forty five I Will check every day it was just at lunch and efficient and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like they were they um it's too dangerous to extradite\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know people cages ...\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I'm having sex with an eight year old boy and it's just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up and I did you do did you\nActually got so that um it can be a good\nCatch yourself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were there were specific like it is but I couldn't watch it was while I think his thinking ... ...

there's you're just tuning in\nThis episode contains graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing to do with their kids in the room mate would cut it out yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty three strikes\nAnd Carlos Rhonda Merrill aside but sorry washed up my aunt had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we add some

to the order was that's here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly orders going viral [noise]\nWe realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is reading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rule they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight

this image is reading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context so they got their team together sat down in a conference\nRoom I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see a bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the rooms says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy book\nEssentially just noticed being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which media the receipts\nPushback while I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvement we made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots\nBack on my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy how how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff back in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally clear they decide to take the photo down but\nBefore they can pull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order\nWe were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason as the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher where did they don't think maybe they have but it's a major news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now a news organization strength parents\nThere let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter is this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your conscience which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built product\nBasically ... and others that the company arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization that could change but setting that aside\nWhat ... what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible like if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective for geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... give give you and I'll give you a great example of this or\nThat happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nSuit the definition of food is something that sustains er nurse rushes yeah as nourishment is something that increases your health so forty percent of the stuff in American

bay area later on it will be mid sixties to\nMid eighties inland lots of sunshine is well in a way\nTo get you in San Francisco and ... highland Sacramento were alive on line ... or ... o'clock\nLast week we were talking to the journalist Franklin for about his latest book world without mind the existential threat to the big tech\nMy argument is against the big technology companies which really are racing to expand into every ... of our lives\nWe spoke with for a year ago his book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nNow since become relevant just because they fired a respect for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because of the nation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation under the writing of it\nIt it actually does it feel good because New America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavow them when they've been so nice to me but this does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue\nWho was the critic who was fired\nHis name is Barry Lynn and he ran some make all these open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly in a very big difference critic of uh of Google\nWe used to have an affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of New America\nThis week on freakonomics radio we tell the rest about Messi story at\nNo point did Google or any ... tell me to fire Barry land\nAnd we look at how corporations use philanthropy to shake the public debate and how that can go terribly wrong um\n[noise]\nYes freakonomics radio show that explores the hidden side of everything [noise] here's your house [noise] even ... [noise]\n[noise]\nBarry Lynn started out as journalists I worked in Venezuela and in ...\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super like grow at Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nAimed at the people who ran businesses so we had a real inside look at how global as Asian actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power is too concentrated\nThis was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got to work going and we did it ah with\nIncreasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty six pain\nWe had a number of folks on the hill starting to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and are the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem\nToday in America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problems since a series of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms doubt lots of companies depend on for survival\nBy Google apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with that small company said that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition and she said you know this is\nNot just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power that leaves two concentrations of wealth and concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market and do but also its parent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies unrest of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who's now president and CEO of New America\nWhat convinced me to leave Princeton then come out of New America which was a big move because I had a wonderful position at at Princeton\nOr was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debate about our future and the digital age\nBut an Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America were not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing\nSome of our attention on the platform monopolies and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the question is if it was um\nWas our work a new American problematic for Google Google ... of Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the boards at Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years\nHe stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn for years Smith was also CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself between Schmidt and Google\nNew America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this is the relationship that goes back to the very early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense\nA year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination European antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website ... congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we released this statement in support of the decision in Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty knife I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times they're\nHeadline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision to reconsider known and if it could not be reconsidered I ask for more time and I was told that\nCat because I'm not affiliated with them and not taking any money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nBut Anne Marie slaughter offered a substantially different portrayal first of all she says no thunder\nAt New America has ever influenced New America content in any way\nAnd this New America has a set of principles on our website that makes very clear that that no funding can affect the integrity of our research at and or or or shape the research in any way way we do not pay to play\nUh we we take funding I and we do our work and posting things are are separate\nBut the timing of inspiring certainly gave the appearance that Google indoor Eric Schmidt had asked to slaughter and or the New America foundation to get rid of Barry Lynn and his open markets Institute and slaughter found yourself on the defense\nStimulate people to be morally awake and in the same moment to get people to consider what type of public policies are frameworks ought to governance structure our collective lives which is a moral and philosophical question [noise]\nWas the

statistically speaking you're almost certainly not but if you are you know that the open championship for what Americans called the British Open is the oldest and arguably most important major tournaments in golf\nThis summer it was won by French ... the first Italian to ever win a major and it was held at the infamous Scottish course current news which is so difficult it's often called her nasty nasty also hosted the than back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nThe golf course was so hard that it inevitably it was going to give us some bizarre conclusion\nBest brand those family he played on the

Savage course\nThe goals that goes with the amount of this way with the ... will be interesting to see what he does not\nThis man John band developed with one holds a play called the three stroke lead\nYou would have been the first Frenchman in over a hundred years to have won the open championship and there was a sense infringement don't win majors Frenchmen paint beautiful paintings and they write books about democracy and revenge they don't win the open championship\nBut standing on the final tea with the three stroke lead if you're a professional golfer you will not lose that tournament how ludicrous would that be imagined a professional chef she's about to make an omelet\nShe goes to crack an egg on the side of the bowl but instead she says how misses the bowl entirely smashes the egg all over her face that's ludicrous it would be to lose a golf tournament standing on the last the\nThe three shot lead you would require a grotesque combination of decisions and actions [noise] there's a word for this and that is such a horrific where some people\nDon't even like to say it loud we're not one of those people yeah there's lots of different ways people can choke ... and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching rate\n[noise]\nIf we're going to talk about choking we probably need to bring in some psychologist\nI'm ... and I'm a professor of psychology at Florida State university here in Tallahassee, Florida\nAnders Ericson pioneer of deliberate practice movement and the ten thousand hours idea that's been studying expert performers for years\nBallet dancers gymnast and all sorts of athletes were look the just the experts surgeons doctors teachers musicians taxi drivers recreational activities like ... and even there is some research on on scientists\nDefined choking for me as you see it [noise]\nOr choking to me is is actually somebody who cramps up an an an in some ways becomes unable to really act appropriately in the situation or ... very decreased performance\nI've defined choking as the worst performance than you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure\nAct from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation\nAnd that's the on by luck I Am a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at the University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\n[noise] so I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people engaging regularly and we're we're most likely to choke\nI really think that any situation where there's expectations for success can cause choking and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching right or if you're in an elevator and\nYou're trying to figure out whether you're going to say something to the person that [laughter] you know we talk about these ethics moments of cocaine but it's a desire to perform at our best and situations in which were evaluated happening constantly\nGive me a little bit on the characteristics of those who are more and less prone to choke what about high IQ versus low IQ\nIn my research and in others we've shown perhaps counter intuitively that individuals who have the most ability to focus them most working memory that most fluid intelligence or actually more prone to perform poorly under stress and the idea is that\nIf you normally devote lots of cognitive resources to what you're doing and being in a pressure felt situation robs here says resources you can't performance while\nYou've just described all the reasons why I'm not very good at playing golf under pressure [laughter] and then let me just ask you one more kind of summary about surroundings I'm Talking about choking in a ... you might call a friendly environment versus a hostile\nEnvironment there's research showing that when you have um friendly faces in front of you people who are supportive although that\nCould feel nice that actually creates pressure filled situations or ... you often start thinking of yourself as they might and so when my mother in the room I sometimes think of myself as a young girl um and you also are quite self conscious\nIn a recent episode about the world cup\nWe looked at the research into why there's such a strong home field advantage in most sports the most plausible explanation is that referees are subconsciously influenced by the home crowd and may make one or two key calls in the home team savor the research also showed that on balance athletes\nThemselves do not perform better in front of the home crowd and in fact we see on ... tells us that friendly\nFaces may actually create pressure filled situations you have to wonder if I'm some dimensions they might perform even worse\nMy main

host Stephen ...\nWhen psychologist think about choking under pressure they consider a variety of thought process that may be subtle and hard to measure economists\nLook at choking differently\nSaid that you would have paid me a million dollar if I give the best interview of the week ... is an economist at the University of California San Diego that would have made me very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this\nWhen we look at the incentives in comics we think about two ways in which it's going to affect us the first is that you felt the more you're put more effort into task and the second to some music more effort\nWill lead to better performance that's not necessarily true and that's the part of choking might be that I can push you so much to to try so hard to really actually backfire and you'll eat perform worse\nCan easy coauthored one of the foundational economics papers on choking it's called large steaks and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments and the ... places including India\nThe reason we wanted to go to India is just over ... our money can go a long way so we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months' salary in our experiment if they did perfectly well\nEach participant completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead creative one was for example to back pieces of metal into into books in an efficient way\nSome tasks we're cognitive\nAnd memory game in which I Would read up numbers you listen to me and then at some point to say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic throwing a dark like clear bold so balls on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars and ten dollar was\nAbout what they made in a month overdue I opened it to agree with me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make you work much harder rides and the question was are you going to be better actually when you were Carter\nAs can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics the higher pay leads to more effort and the more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nThe findings were striking UC reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in lower success rate when ...\nChoked actually were a bit surprised by this experiment because we included tasks in which we expected that ... will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure so can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks may cause succumb to pressure\nThey ran some more experiments at MIT using students as a research subject some experiments involved simple manual tasks like punching alternating keyboard keys as fast as possible\nIt's really something that you know if you do it for long enough seats boring so he felt pay you more you'll try may be harder and we believed more effort will actually increase your performance\nOther tasks we're more cognitive like adding numbers and ...\nWhen you think about comes to stuff probably reach your ultimate behavior to your best and very fast and now he's been really really make any high incentives you might actually started being you know distracted\nOnce again there were low and high incentive versions of each task since a dollar doesn't go far in Massachusetts says it doesn't India the rewards here we're up to thirty dollars for the low incentive experiments and up to three hundred dollars for the high\nSo what we found is that for dirt keep pressing to ask when you increase the incentives from op too especially dogs dropped to three hundred dollars they speech from above their forty percent succeeding to eighty percent succeeding\nOn the other end when you have to add up numbers the more cognitive one we see a sharp decrease from sixty five percent to forty percent so when you actually have to put some companies to produce getting day the incentive to be ridiculously high could actually be a bad idea\n[noise] this would seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves thinking we're more susceptible to choke poor you've probably heard from a lot of people over the years coach and teachers and\nCounselors of all sorts of you are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out of the way [noise]\nBut that's obviously harder than it sounds so how can you do that how can you prepare yourself to not crumble under the very circumstances\nThat matter most how do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic\nSee on ... again going back to her Gulf experiments\nSo we investigated whether going quicker for example um might help eliminate poor performance under pressure or I'm having one key swing thought that encapsulates your entire stroke\nMight be better um and we showed that some of that was the last fall and that leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess of your body up on on the back nine you just say hey that was a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great said so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else can you tell us about in this domain\nAt least I'm learning to joke with\nWe also showed that getting used to this type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes with performance can be helpful so really inoculate in yourself against the high pressure situations you see it as the students who practice taking time pass a\nUC Davis with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions are going to perform under and you even see that if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players are used to what it's going to feel like can be in that big stadium um\nAnd this is true in really big important situations but it's it's also true in those little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it while people are watching you know um and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to the kinds of all eyes on you\nOkay so put yourself in realistic and stressful practice situations with him rethinking how you're feeling so we know that when people remind themselves that um that sweaty palms and beating heart aren't assign they're going to fail but a sign that they're awake and ready to go\nAnd their body is Jan Ting important nutrients to their mind that can be really affect us\nNow is that a charade or is that real I mean [laughter] if my palms are sweaty isn't an indication that I Am anxious in that if I just tell myself well not really anxiety it's really my body ... nutrients I mean is that a a self lie that I profit\nFrom or is that realistically you know a counter truth\nFirst of all I Will just say that I'm I I liked placebo effects and [laughter] I have no problem with that but I think it's a real truth because you know if your heart wasn't beating to some extent you'd be dead right um and those sweaty palms can be an indication that you're alert an aroused and ready to go and arousal doesn't have to be a bad thing right\nCom [noise] well good morning I'm Beth Heiden Guss Sunday will bring sunshine temperatures ranging from the upper

in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here than there\nWere people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his\nExplosive vest outside or in the north there was shelling in ... we know that they burn down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one

the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province\nBut I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament\nHas been a frustration to many almost a symbol of the corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think

columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested it came to mind is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and a Kingsolver and of\nCourse uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that got people who are activists journalists dissidents [noise] um and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those numbers of civil society\nAnd you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist up without their intelligence services leaking the information I it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like a hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and ... and others that so there clearly not a good beacon of liberal democracy and the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know a ... and of course uh it really extracting I think an important apartment important price or from the studies which has yet to be determined directly\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed a Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount as a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange they need to invest in it they need investment opportunities and that's all something that maybe in the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe they can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so that doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now countries with ... ...\nVery clear thought that and so it really depends on now for centuries with with with liquid ...\nUh and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on the runway and tracked Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we're presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very nicely blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been heading and this was published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the event was\nA fabrication in these officials better showman than Mexican Government said that they are to me and if it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends species that bishops dirty what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official ... is our ally is not true it's a lie so\nTell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked\n[noise] what I discovered was that the army and the ... not jealous where not nice about why do I stop any that night\nEvery minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just is even more I had reports all the shirt reports that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean see I was before that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how would the students kills [noise]\nWell that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police\nThey state police were waiting for them than students decide to move that to Boston where they where it's I spoke dating insight to the CD to be able to take the more versus mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to that brought this to Mexico City\nSo they went to was a station\nThey do do that you both ... and ... when the students were trying to escape on board will be spy bosses\n... when the army the police then when you see by police and the staples east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're always at the end of that back way to process\nFrom these two buses disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students on this bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is why they did was just too\nAnd so these two versus\nWhat exactly that to boast is that the army and they said that police it starts to monitor it seems to have a worse before I mean these two both said was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why ... so\nWhat I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside the nest secrets parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students have even now it's for the army and if it that I Believe they knew it\nSo these students\nWere almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what\nThese guys that are really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow do you know that heroin was hitting on that bus\nI was able to connect with one drugs that are important drug lord I was able to conduct with one person that works for him and and west these ah informants and inside

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain that Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or us how she might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd is this situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the states that same as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave traced a lot of uh uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run state the\nTaxes are simply too high there's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course the state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections Democrats were caught on the short side\nAfter the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers somebody's governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here if the elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much that you\nForty five years ago this Sunday

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for cleaning native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU he's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use are destined for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can over your identity and we can bring a vision when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work to actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why people are different from each other\nSort of the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading best still matters in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and in many Political Comebacks I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that much to say it may be that the most important thing for them as they should be able to get our kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the cameras and who's best for that and that's the kind of ... the one on the ground so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co often\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should I answer a question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I\nI think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently during his mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and not me I'm a terrible road because once you've created a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to build a wind and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and you know will for the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel assured hostility to some other and\nIn our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now\nThe labels conservative and liberal are\nAssociated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one of my identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that intellectual reserved and then whoever wins or when you sort of gather behind in order for around the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a real notice concern on that identity and and the politics around it has been weaponized and and it's certainly\nI think it is learning I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that where more defined is around identities that we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion and there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground but it's not available to us\nBecause the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing\nLosing for the other side\nA class for compromise I'm turning everything into an identity is my very hard to

go see in a borrowed good morning\nIt's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us good to be here to live [noise]\nSo where people are able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul\nOr the suicide bombers trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside a bit of countries city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of cobble a brought his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around as a number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of the corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and

to the question of are Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since the Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi constantly and assemble ... is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy parents are are the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many that issuing statements supporting a boat that Saudi Arabia and the acting so of course that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot a\nLot of fear a lot of worry that got people who are active as journalists gifted in 'em and goes you may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those sent letters with civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um\nOut Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think er and they've been very calculated the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others so there are clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man Gerard and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important important important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determines I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question ... what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange that eating less meant that he'd investment

that doesn't want to go to the Iowa or to what it was very clear about that and so it really depends on now countries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I

of Wisconsin parts of Michigan than they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states said with the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and

that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the states that soon as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national times just can overwhelm everything yeah\nThe taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the\nTaxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the line now if they can win back some of these chambers somebody's governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that
