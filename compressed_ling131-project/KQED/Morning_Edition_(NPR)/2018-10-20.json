something extraordinary was happening that was happening quietly um but nonetheless was really showing up very much and and social surveys [noise]\nUh which was that the English were beginning to assert themselves as a political community\nThere were beginning ... actually you know what this British saying when we're not that interested in anymore we want to be English [noise] nobody paid much

it's a lot of them like it was something that was you know people were being told to feel [noise]\nSo it was organic and it was it was coming out of I think in retrospect things that we should expect since\nThe English are very proud nation they they you know a very long history um arguably was the first functioning nation states in the world has been in in our terms going right back to the the fourteenth century [noise]\nBad language they had a\nSet of customs laws they had all the things that you would associate with and I should say very early on a very strong proud identity\nWhy are we surprised that it's coming back while we're surprised because it did an extraordinary thing in a way it sorts of faked its own death and [laughter]\nIt it rolled itself into two other construct one of which was the empire of course and the other fish was the union with which Scotland ... on islands that are from ...\nAnd ... English and this was sort of contained within these all the structures\nSo if those two structures change well then you would expect him to ... to reemerge on the empire they've gone or not everybody knows that but it is ... um\nAnd the union began to change radically in like Nineteen Ninety two big things happen like Ninety Ninety the about fast peace agreements in Northern Ireland Nineteen Ninety eight and the following year the Scottish parliament's was established\nBut once you begin to see coming up really in surveys the into the beginning of the century is the English was drawing mentally from the union\nAnd we should have seen this the twenty eleven national ... has been taken in the u._k. a large majority of people in England offered the choice but do you think of yourself as British British and English or English large majorities ... English only\nAnd they also are the big surveys were asking things like who represents England who should make the laws for England's the most basic questions do you think it's OK the Westminster the part of the ... the union parliament's investments are makes our friend lived [noise] no [laughter]\nCertainly the English you're saying now\nIn in in twenty twelve big survey asked that question do you think the status quo where Westminster makes last for England is okay\nTwenty four percent an English people said yeah it's okay ... okay [laughter] three quarters of them are saying I don't want my laws for me as an industry is made in Westminster this is extraordinary stuff and we weren't paying attention to it because I said there was no there was no political movements who was no real media attention paid to us [noise]\nBut this was going to emerge somewhere I don't know it emerged in that kind of frustration that nobody's listening to us nobody nobody pays attention numbers even naming the fact that we think of ourselves as of lifting and see I'm I'm wants to be recognized as such and\nThe first opportunity the English got to give somebody a kick and say pay attention to us was was the ... ... and therefore in retrospect it's not that surprising that they took that opportunity to say we want to be paid attention to it and\nThe irony is that breaks it actually doesn't answer any of those questions you know it really doesn't meet the needs that were there but I think this is an underlying for someone we're still grappling with what are the implications of\nThe rising of English nationalism for Scotland's for ... for for Ireland uh because of course we all day and intertwined for for so long that uh if if if this is happening it's it's it's seismic in terms of all of those relationships with no\nSo this is this tends to to integration is there are some real world or anxiety so you had the euro zone crisis the economic crisis that sense of\nOf contagion O'Hara entered the um immigration with a larger issue um where they're auditors that that they were literally sort of issue oriented that that ... that drove as well as I said the sense of

what's appealing to the working class communities in in ... for example for breakfast that they want the opposite they want\nTo protect them they want all of his public services say they want to see

on your now proposing with brags is to make this border not just an international frontier but a frontier between a block of twenty seven countries ... on that I'd sides country you know ... something that has never ever being in its in its history and could never happen and visit by anybody [noise]\nOh so this is this is deeply reckless because it's it's just as you know the thing you've been doing over there you Irish people actually you know we don't care about it anymore\nWe're going to stop and this is not me as a ... there's there's there's two pieces of research they asked to leave voters there was a big survey to people who voted leave were asked the question very directly\nUm would the destruction of the Irish peace process be a price worth paying for breakfast eighty three percent of voters said yes\nAbsolutely [laughter] I'm as another fair but I just I just that last week which says pretty much the same thing\nAnd ask conservative members of the conservative party ... what'd you make the parts of the Saudi actually process to have breakfast the success of a deeper sense yes the opposite of extraordinary and\nI don't want to be most of the ... I I you know ... I don't blame people about it but but it is an act of extraordinary recklessness you know to say actually we don't really care what's going on over there aren't as I said just kind of saying you people are far him\nEven while in fact I'm assisting you're part of the United kingdom this is Britain's own territory this is not you know it's not somewhere off in the mid Atlantic you know this is a place that Britain claims to be an absolute into real parts of its own territory so\nThose are the kind of recklessness here there's no solved with us there there's there's no real\nPlan I'm so what the Irish Government has had to do is to say look we can't trust you on this you know [noise] if\nSo everybody's saying so it looks very simple everybody signed for cannot be our border and you know the including British governments governments European Union they are almost everybody saying copy high bar to go back to that so\nThat looks very simple see all the great what's the problem [noise] I'm saying just trust us on his will will work out something or after we've done the deal with the European Union and we're going to get the fabulous deal and it's going to give us you know we're going to have cake and eat cake and everything has got to be just wonderful solve costs will be ... I'll be fine\nOn the governments that I I I think we may not have to force if I look we can't take it on trust but it's going to be fine this is this is really serious matter for some and it's this is an existential special for us [noise] and you must know plan here you have absolutely\nNo sense at all of of of how you're going to achieve this thing that we all agree on listen shaved [noise] so this is why are you got this I won't bore you with all the the the bureaucratic language but to step back stop you may have heard of which is the painters now stopping ...\nWhich is the\nEuropean Union on the on a ... I actually hear your new and not just the outcome of the European Union in concert with the government is saying\nThere can be no agreements with Britain were not doing any deal with you until you have parents he about the fact that there will be no ... enough I sort of trust us about this but an actual legal international guarantee it has to be placed in stone\nOr something to that and what what the Irish and the Europeans are saying is look if you can come up with another solution fine\nAbsolutely you know if you think there's something magical technological solution that you can have the border between the European Union um Britain that has no infrastructure tall never existed in human history from do you think you can do about fine where are all ties with\nBullets all we're saying is if you can't there's a failsafe richest that you're guaranteeing that there must be one I'm therefore you're gonna have to do certain other things\nAnd of course the other things mean that really the only way that I think this can work still is if the u._k. has a very soft ranks as if it stays within the European customs union and in large parts of the single market\nBut of course that's exactly what I'm saying it's all the stuff that will not to that's why the earth that the ... the talks are in such a quagmire I mean they've been unable to move forward on it's all about the Irish issue and you know that the Irish issue is absolutely central to the whole thing\nI was a great example of the return of the repressed you know if you if you don't talk about it if you would know this is talk of back and bite you and that's really what's happening with breakfast and so what are the chances of a compromise in which northern\nIreland can uh can in fact be separated off from back said they allowed to be part of the new even now it's part of the and I can so I'm\n...\nThe ... to be fair to it or not I've often been a critic of the but it's it's actually been pretty extraordinary on this issue\nUm [noise]\nThey they even go see Asian than Michelle Burnette who's leading the same I'm On I'm ... really are everybody from the European sizes\nSponsorship of the cake

Rowe dot com\nOr listen when it's not great but for all the reasons we've been talking about [noise] and\nI genuinely think the British don't look up to the Irish are kind of small you know when it comes to it when is the big kind of spin all the last minute some of the way these things are dumb we'll just fudge the Irish like come on you know it took ... you know there'll be a formula of words [noise]\nAnd I think they miscalculated really fundamentally about this you know that they thought I could be bullied but they also thought the European Union would say oh the arts bloody Irish that's you know let's forget about it on his practice has not happened to have him being a single cigarette vapor between the artist edition of the European Union position [noise] so what's your opinion has done is is being very generous and it said look\nI just really difficult for us where a rule bounds organization did your opinion is just a set of rules and if we start playing fast and loose with those rules and say well you can do a bit of this and you can do a bit of that a whole thing will collapse however they said look\nI don't know what I was kind of first of all they suffered a loss right it's a it's it's it's a part of the world that are really hard time secondly it's small it's a million and a half people it's not going to threaten the entire structure of the European Union so less be generous let's say in your case\nYou can have\nThe best of both worlds right we're not saying you have to leave the u._k.\nSo therefore legally insolvency terms you you'll be leaving the European Union however you can continue to act as if you're in the European Union [noise]\nI'm Wondering how that they've done this because it's a very hard thing to remember but under the peace deal with and I can achieve peace to every single person in Northern Ireland has an absolute rise to the European Union citizenship that cannot be changed my breakfast\nWhy because they have a right to Irish Citizenship so he's going to be Irish or British are both the the legal manifestation of that is your enticed when our task force you're on TALK to our citizenship\nTherefore because nobody thought about this up time because the idea that that would be leaving their opinion and never never rose but the implications of an hour that you have you have this million and a half people\nWho have an absolute right to your opinion says there cannot be taken away from its guaranteed in international law the civilians is not just a an internal documents it's an international treaty registered with United Nations it's a full piece of international law [noise]\nTo say less than we do say trite but I don't know maybe some people have been involved some trade deals I haven't but I've spoken to people who are they take a minimum of seven years\nThe candidates are looking for took seven years cynical ... you know doesn't credibly complex I mean you're talking about you know like ... and standards for you know the most extraordinary goods and services and all sorts of things and [noise] um\nSo she's being pushed in this direction she has realized that she has to compromise ... so British industry is now saying\nThis is catastrophic I mean we're we're we're facing possible catastrophe here so as soon as I said but you know for example um [noise] the ... the European aerospace industry the only um rival to buy a house in terms of making planes\n[noise] uh is essentially a Franco British\nSo the Airbus planes are made in France and actually largely in Wales and in in ... [noise] so we gay\nHuge numbers of aircraft parts go from France So tired of 'em back every single day you know it's completely integrated supply chains [noise]\nThat's just one example ... bills a five hundred thousand dollars a year in Sunderland which voted for breakfast this working class of its biggest employer isn't it sounds Japanese carmaker\nNissan brings in I I had to myself when I saw this fear I thought I was wrong I I have to actually go back and check you know [noise] but it's actually true they they bring in three million\nAnd day not about a week a day they bring in the mood in parts of the day they are I I was all of these big companies are now they are fully incidents like ...\nAnd it's all just in time Nissan have half a day's stores on hand in so doing with half a day after half a day the plants close this town now if you are saying those three million ... have to be\nChecked [laughter] every day it's just impossible just cannot be done\nSo they had to miss an M recently came out and said look we we didn't say this during the Brexit referendum 'cause we didn't think it was going to pass you know we just thought if if we interfere with the accused of you know trying to frighten people and things\nBut I'm really sorry we just have to close I mean we just count up you know you you just can't do this we've invested billions and as we don't want to do the ... of the state of the ... at DePaul is normally some of the people that really works is from topic we're delighted with us\nBut we cannot be having\nNon tariff barriers for three million things going in and out of that stuff never mind the actual cars that are just trying to assist in in terms of profit on this is British industry saying we are facing a catastrophe if there's no deal all of this stuff comes to a halt people are out of work does it through the normal is kind of economic hits\nOne of the political consequences of that who knows however what has happened this nobody including towards my has built up the political authority to say come on folks get real here you know\n... in the process of every revolution always has you know fantastic utopian days it's all going to be great [noise]\nIt was those people who were stopping us from being wonderful and as soon as we get rid of those people must be wonderful but you know that's the basic knowledge of a revolution and then somebody has to come along at some stage and the polio is whatever I say you can't keep doing this you know ... ... ... ... ... you know some kind of rationality has to be applied here\nAnd the problem is that brings it undermines political authority to such an extent in London that there's now nobody I mean not the government's not the opposition so the Labour Party which is the alternative governments is also completely divided about prices on his afraid to really say anything very much\nSo much you have is you you have a situation in which there's a real need for our pragmatism adverse sort of genuine patriotism or somebody says look\nThis is south harm ... it's not in our interest to continue to try to do this stuff at this level somebody has to come in and said there's always all sorts of compromises on you won't like some of them that's what pragmatic life is like\nI'm Theresa May is the person is going to have to say that but she has to prepare yourself to be in that role so so she started taking this very extreme position [noise]\nAn over the next two weeks you don't have to come out and say look what you people average just shut up [laughter] I'm really sorry but you can't keep doing this kind of crazy\nYou know ... nationalist revolution stuff this is people's livelihoods this is this the future of the country this is real stuff with in real people's lives and we have to speak honestly to them and say\nHow's your leader I'm not going to lead you off a cliff ... ... ... and we don't know yet\nSponsorship of the cake weedy life's dream bike super micro Silicon

wants to look at an understanding that is is the Italian job\nWas like okay and and ah it's ... it's all about going into Europe and so it kind of a very very Seinfeld but I don't remember where it ends up that ends up with what they steal all the goals from ... in\nThe Italian and they're both ... put it onto a bus and they're getting away and the going through that the alpine passes and then they take a wrong turn on the bus is left\n... over the cliff us going like that and that the goal is on one hand and all the crew of criminals are on the other half and if they move towards the goals the boss will will will go off and if they don't move towards the gold and the whole thing is part of that's exactly right so that's a little bit of like how to move forward\nTo to get this prize the wild and they can't get out of the um it's it's a really starting to situation\nSo is this loss of authority on everyone's fired on and on on all parties part is that the greatest danger yes I'm not on and it's it's the problem for us in our lives is danger for sort of course because you know we we have no say in this we we we cannot insulin swap happens in Britain itself\n[noise] um [noise] but you know it's it's it's it's a real lesson to us I think we all wide rightly you know I I'm I'm I'm a professional I just had her you know I tried to get make people question\nPower is being used and how politics is working all this kind of things and it is it after the Democratic to to to do that you know ... and that's one of the guys democracy it's like I'm not being super silly us about people who voted for banks that they they engaged in in in a political choice [noise]\nBut ... has to be balanced by a sense that actually we all depends on political structures\nThat we may criticize on we may dislike but we were tops Troy those political structures without being very careful as to walk takes their place on a walk kind of um institutions my my my my work for us and\nThe institutions themselves have to have some democratic authority\nWhat happened in Britain was they use the Democratic mechanisms that they enough power just our culture referendum that if you look at the entire history of of political self consciousness in in England in particular it's about the sovereignty of parliament that is what you know English history is about\nTo turn around and one of the most critical existential questions that you faced in in in in your mouth and history and say actually this is not going to do the parliament's go it's going to be done by a popular votes\nThat's fine if you think that's true how are we going to follow through on that\nBut to have them do not so they've they've placed off ... in this sacred moments\nJune twenty third tiny sixteen that moment to people spoke with lots of people say you know they said we we don't want to be in that tank [laughter] that's fine but it doesn't really get you very far doesn't tell you how you're going to do this and how are you going to do with with least self harm [noise]\nI mean in my view it's crazy decision I think\nI I I I I talked to a guy who was a very old I'm tried union negotiator in any sense to me a very pro British guy um and he said\nYou know the only three possibilities if if you're going into a negotiation or you know as a labor leader but you say you know what am I ... I'm In this case are only three possibilities one was to stop or slow which they have rejected\nThe second with something better than the status quo which the European Union could not possibly give a leaving member I mean\n... if you can leave a club I have all the benefits outside of is that the public on but you know the literally the urban union would would dissolve in in five years if if and ends up to something better than the status quo by leaving the European Union's gum\nSo you couldn't get something better than I was ... and so the only thing left something worse in the status quo\nWho in their right mind would want that [noise] but ... in ... effectively what they've bought they're stuck with and then you need a political us are just I like to make it the least worst than the status quo it could possibly be less let's limit the self harm\nThat as much as we possibly can and I'm so that we saw the whole thing doesn't go crazy and maybe down the road where we're going to ... to to to to rethink us [noise] um my deep deep worry is that nobody is starting tomorrow\nAnd the the moral imperative actually standing up and saying you may hate me for this you might think I'm a traitor you might think I'm week\nIce ranging mid sixties coast through the seventies around the bay up to the mid eighties and but in sunny for Sacramento highs around eighty four\n\n...

seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage therapy practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international

about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that\nMake clear that the kind of behavior we seemed top two weeks is unacceptable even ... thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nThat American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that they were in Boston has been looking into ... an investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years seals special forces\nAnd other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah you're right in the article\nThat the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects struggles to changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges\nBarracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is mhm\nBut your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries I see no there's not many other names for them the N. word definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings\nFor the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed a by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty fifty\nThese special forces are unsealed veterans maybe feel veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the aid and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is very important political party in Yemen to this llamas party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was so you know technically yeah this is a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this\nVery strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know and I guess I'm among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nYou've seen how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are numbers on lots of a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is going to ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend here are the only ones who've done this or the other countries would try it um are there other Americans as the new ones and our other Americans who believe you've uncovered yeah right is\nThis happening in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work well\nThere are several reasons why

edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon we've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis is that the face of addiction can be just about any fish and the rich or is it appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days\nChurch many readers this week it included a photo of this Marlene fish of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Hayden\nWas grinning from his perch on her back that photo shoot a good day from it but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production ... party a drug to hold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us\nThanks for having me first we're [noise] we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying how she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm\nLater on when she became addicted to drugs and it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was ... she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm into farm and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nShe drove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise]\nWhat made you sure all of this and you're aerobics were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our ... our you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her use and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nUnderstand there's going to be a

there'll be performances and we actually have a [noise] a video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs she's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family

G. God well visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote a column for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that data complete paperwork for his marriage President Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not\nCriticized the Saudis NPR's Don Gonyea was with the president on the campaign swim out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments a after Saturday's the Saudis announced a it confirmed\nThe obvious that Mr show jihad died or in their custody he at the at the embassy and\nPushed and both the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big said a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's\nGood first step it's a big ... that a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people\nCrunch referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the show used at the unacceptable\nBut also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and and as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWith a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact tracks or as the number of jobs and we'll say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting again given how quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like uh not sell with the Saudis now\nAll of this\nComes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he present his argument at his rallies he\nIs really trying to get the a C is hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested camera Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about that that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this\nIs from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November\nWould be a bright flashing invitation to every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and\nCome on and so that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of your mouth to show G\nAnd very down ... thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death in your mouth and showed gee\nWe turn now to ... he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership bathroom thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience just as Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a pump tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think\nOne of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saturday an explanation by the president of how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both\nWashington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies I first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them\nOr so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries on to a\nPoint of value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president\nSeems to be more inclined to accept Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference in our own elections\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro that Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware

one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in the Foreign Relations we need to hold up\nThe moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to expressing outrage there practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we deemed top few weeks it's on

metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden\nWas grinning from his perch on her back that photo showed a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production ... high school party a drug took hold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato Neal wrote that obituary joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying how she wanted to be\nAn actress and starring Broadway musical and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs and it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a ... who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be Lance so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates on into farm and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then it's often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDr ... more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you share all of this in your obituary\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't find her but it did define\nThe way she left and sits in not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also want it to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to

treated her obituary so let's put our money where our ... our you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solution you know medication assisted treatment things like math a donor buprenorphine there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based painkiller\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame are huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that Matty is one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with your son and her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI

singing a bonding rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know they also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our

fight inside the shouted consulate in Istanbul and October second President Trump says well it's good that Saudi Arabia is offered an explanation for his death\nIt's only a first step president wants to gather more information before deciding how to respond some members of Congress will call for sanctions on the Saudis\nSo far the administration's appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince\n... reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nLong strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n... is right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly enlist in residence at the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about the search transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed and have it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military and those are the biggest orders of the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom as pledged forty five billion dollars and helped bankroll tech companies like uber than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel Bronson author the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term ... invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing in institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both of us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Bronson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly whenever\nThe happiness station has put all of their ... and they have been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mine\nAs the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now maybe as many\nAs ... as a way this is so\nSad but Bronson says Saudi Arabia was already backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhich I'm On his choking represented for many of us was disbelief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he couldn't be patient he he expected to the patient not like he didn't expect with their reversal that he was seeing with behind some on\nTrump says he will listen to congressional calls for sanctions against the Saudis and that he wants to work with lawmakers even as the president stresses he wants to preserve those multi billion dollar arm sales Scott Horsley NPR News Washington\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably remember Haitian mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that's something that they were ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news she joined us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years seals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah you're right\nThere's not many other names for them at the N. word definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in eight and twenty fifty\nThese special forces a unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the aid and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen to Islamic party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group and unless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was so you know technically he had a ... a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nAnd I guess I'm among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that do governor whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can listen foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what's the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nYou've seen how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are numbers on\nA lot of lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... sure\nRight yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is for ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend here are oh they're the only ones who've done this are there other countries who try it I'm sure there are Americans\nAnd the ones in or other Americans who believe you've uncovered yet right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there are several reasons one is and there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy of us has not spoken out against the war in Yemen or we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we sell them guns we train them we can do to train them\nShut out of the

NPR has helped them to better understand a complex nation in the world through its in depth coverage of events ideas and cultures\nAnd the listeners of ... this weekend\nEDITION from NPR News I'm Scott Simon I wait all week to say it's time for sports\n[noise]\nAnd I have in the game growers versus Dodgers after the roof beat the sun's out of LA Dodgers last night seven to do when you're not a Howard Bryant or ESPN dot com\nESPN the magazine Howard thanks so much for being with us\nIn the morning Scott how are you doing I'm fine thanks blue man group Abreu crew spy on nickname for um how do you like I like that I kind of do they keep coming back all season don't they\nWell they do and this is nice revenge for last year ... I mean there last year because of your your cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that this is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two\nAnd of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know that this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season\nIn Boston in Boston that's right and if they are they wait exactly yes and a Christian taller debuted as assistant coach for the Washington Wizards\nShe's also she'll playing in the NBA for domestic Mickey Hammon of course has already in assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs is the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nI think it's coming and they think is overdue when they make I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive league the NBA's been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having\nFemale referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris Burke on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not\nThat big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to know gifts [laughter] no and in in that sport it's a big deal in in professional sports and move the male dominated game and also let's not forget that the ESPN actually put\nThe you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's\nMaria Cramer both doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important and these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's it's going to be good\nWomen's tennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's gonna be a rule change at Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of those six hour final ... what do you think of the rule change to go to the er about what what are they going to do it the hybrid break yeah\nAfter after twelve after twelve twelve and they're going to go to a tie break the way that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the fifth set type breaking I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they can get to a big deal\nAnd I I get it I don't like it because I think that if imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall districts or Lebanon or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break serve [laughter]\nOf Howard thank you you're in San Francisco good they're commemorating fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the\nMedal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard no it was terrific thank you\nWhen the baby of an HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers deliver to the infant and risk transferring HIV or but the child grows sugar and most likely die\nChild received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV the surgery is your first and could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa\nWe're about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world\nDr Harriet Etheridge is a medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and she was part of a team of doctors who help prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much had in the audience that\nHow's the baby doing\nAnd the baby's doing very well we are very yeah after the transplant surgery happen now and to see this child alive and thriving under these circumstances with this world famous case is\nObviously enormously got to find and it really makes us feel good about the decision we may\nWell help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't yeah\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV but the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being\nOn our way to list for and there's a diner for three times the average and this child is getting\nReally sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents telling you\nSay the parents saying to us\nWhy ... where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day why when you consider us so they was said to me that wish from the parents and the ... who was the dynamic\nThat she could be done and we had to consider that they can sneak 'cause we have to make sure that we promote Senate hot steel ton any of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much you make today to buy a request from this ... sets of parents who wanted to save the life of their child\n[noise] ... do you think this uh this case the more people know about it we'll contribute something to lifting the stigma that they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to say you know a tabby stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted\nSays us in South Africa cat although we have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really ... to ... to what we've done had is that if you're an HIV positive tests and and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that shouldn't ... from being an organ during that it shouldn't stuff came from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case\nAnd it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nThat carried Etheridge medical bioethicist at Vince Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us thank you
