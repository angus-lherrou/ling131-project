absolutely\nAnd a remarkable and positive in that way and probably the most important is the\nChurch or walking to the United states to the new world to save the old world from fascism and this was America's greatest moment ah in in fact I in World War two but there are\nMany many many many more cases where the world is rather aghast at a what America is doing from Vietnam to the war on Saddam Hussein in two thousand three\nTo the overthrow of literally dozens of governments around the world and assassination of political leaders around the world by the CIA so no I don't believe that the world has waded in bated breath\nI don't believe that the world has waded in bated breath for America to come to the global rescue what I Do think is absolutely true\nIs that individual countries and often scoundrels I have to appeal to the U.S to a back them in their particular local battle against somebody else\nAnd often in mashed the United states in a horrible local wars in which we have no stake\nWeighed against this kind of view because when Franklin Roosevelt\nOur greatest president to by fire in American history in my view I created a really and his and produce and imagination the United nations and established a a basis for\nA post World war two order the United states signed up to an international legal order\nOr the idea is that the un by being a the place of legitimacy to decide issues of war and peace and specifically the U.N Security council or that this would be a vehicle for United Nations\nTo secure the global peace\nAnd America championed that view from Nineteen forty five on word in on the easy relationship with the exceptionalism so there was a battle\nFor the hearts and minds I Would say of America and its self image and vision and understanding of the world but there was a strong feeling that create a rule of law create\nWas a strong feeling that create a rule of law create an international trade under principled agreements or first does something called the gap now something called the world Trade Organization\nChampion international agencies to fight disease and to fight hunger\nI empower the United nations and go to war in Korea under a vote of the U.N Security council I appear I as a president or before the U.N General assembly not to attack it\nBut to to appeal for a rural based system is President Kennedy did and some of the most eloquent speeches ever made by an American president to the United nations now we have a snarling I antagonist I expressing hostility and disdain\nWhen Trump goes before the general assembly I've watched him now twice a close up and it said to my taste horrifying so I think I I'm Still clinging to that idea\nThat also America itself has had that the real safety for our country and the real security for the world and the real ability to face\nProfoundly important\nComplex challenges managing our oceans of fighting environmental disaster protecting us from the hole and the ozone does fighting climate change requires global cooperation mutual respect\nAnd the body of international law\nThat's of course what I'm arguing for in this book that that is not naive that is a a correct idea\nAnd what is true also perhaps surprising is that the opinion surveys demonstrate\nTime and again that despite\nThe backhanded way that many of us actions have treated\nThe un has sometimes mocking sometimes full disdain often orderly direct repudiation is going to war against Saddam Hussein when the U.N Security council absolutely would not back that\nThe American people by a significant majority view the United nations as a force for good typically around Seventy percent approval rating and that\nIn a country where many a state political parties like the the Republican Party of taxes called routinely get out of the un get the un out of the United states I ... from uh our shores the large majority of the American people\nHave not seen it that way that gives me hope and I suppose that's the foot hold on which this book rats\nWhether it's taking on American exceptionalism as an idea whether it's a encouraging reinvigorate nation of the United states' commitment to the United nations whether it's just\nTaking you read or by the hand and courage ing him or her to have a different view of this country's role in the world\nOr you're asking a lot you're asking are reframing on the part of the reader from everything they might have heard since they were a student in in ah in elementary school well let's take a specific case that you offer\nThat an outcome of this um reframing of the American role in the world could be for instance the end of military action in the middle east that's a briefing suggestion and wanting to make fairly early on\nWhat would that look like a this is a place where the United states has been vitally engaged in the entire post war era and even before\nAbsolutely right and in my view of the middle east is that we are still fighting the wars that were created by the imperial pretensions of Britain and France or in World War one eye when the Ottoman Empire\nFell I Britain and France the to a European imperial powers\nI decided that they would be up to divvy up the middle east I've so a friend Scott Lebanon in Britain got Palestine I and Iraq I they shared\nA influence and responsibility in Syria I and I began and

just overstretched we are completely\nIllegitimate leash where we should not be and we are not creating peace we are not creating order we created a lot of hatred a lot of instability\nAnd a lot of illusion\nWhere we are appealed to every day by some faction somewhere save us from our enemy we don't know who these enemies are\nWe review nothing we discuss nothing I when\nIt came to the one discussion we had about a Libya it had\nNothing to do with a war that overthrew\nA government it was all about and attack on the U.S embassy and it was a highly partisan a hearing to attack Hillary Clinton as secretary of state but to review the idea of NATO or\nOverthrowing a government through a military operation not approved\nBy uh the the United Nations no not the slightest interest at all so\nWe are re far from\nI what I'm suggesting uh all I can do is try to explain why I think I were on a dangerous course which I Do\nA and I'm hoping that somehow this can be at least a modest part of a\nNational discussion to regain our senses\nAre that are at a minimum we need to re democratize foreign policy if we want to have a democracy and that democracy is absolutely ... when it comes to our international outside a\n... almost ... non functional now\nBut this were locked in this sense of being stuck comes at a time when the United states is\nA a declining share of world productive capacity and declining share of world GDP um it is fascinating that this world that you're explaining to the reader\nSeems less and less suited for a twenty first century where the United states is still rich still powerful steel productive but a lot of other places in the world are too and instead of that leading to a more cooperative\nWorld system it's leading to one where of our politicians are insisting in both parties\nOn American freedom of movement and unilateralism\nThis is a part of the debate and I I make the point is an economist that\nThe American century I was a call to dated in Nineteen forty one and really I in its full glory\nIn the late forties and early fifties at an extraordinary moment when in World War two most of the other industrial countries have been destroyed by war\nAnd for the United states the war experience was a\n... unbelievable boom of industrial might\nAnd technological prowess so the United states really dominated the world economy and was so far ahead technologically and managerial you an organization ally of even Europe or Japan or China was a complete no show at the time\nOr that one could believe in in that right or wrong in that\nCapacity to shape the world's in one's image now since then the technological capacity\nFirst of course was restored to Europe early on through reconstruction the rise of Japan and the rise of many other\nAsian countries and then most consequential you are the soaring remarkable I economic rise of China in the last forty years\nSo for my take a it's exactly as you say I feel that we're like the cartoon character that runs off the cliff\nBut in the cartoon hangs there I'm believing that everything is fine until they look down and then prove that they they start to plummet\nThat's my view or not that we're going to plummet but that we haven't recognized the changing shape of the world\nIf you ask Donald Trump says he no doubt salmon idiot\nI America's the greatest we've got the biggest stock market boom we've got this we've got bad where are the superpower I we can wipe anybody trade wars are easy will contain China I think the view\nI actually taking on a substantively that claim that uh hell no one can mess with us and I view it as very naive\nI I see with my own eyes countries around the world\nSee with my own eyes countries around the world have by the way almost anywhere you go in the world the infrastructure is brighter more sparkling at airports are brighter more sparkling then you find in the United states where our infrastructure is forty or fifty years old\nOn so I don't feel that you meet and this and that does sense of bravado but\nDefinitely that is the perception from inside the United states and it's no doubt or the perception in Donald Trump's had\nThere's this idea that cooperation that interdependence is for wimps is facilities\nAre but you write cooperation is not blind trust and it should not be naive or unconditional and you posit that gains can be large and mutual you are a optimistic idealistic\nAbout an idea that still seems a long way off in our politics\nWell definitely as we uh\nHave believed for a long time actually\nThat you don't really need a broad cooperation you find coalitions of the willing at best and that sense for powerful and we can lead we can always poll\nDozens of countries along with us so the\nPhrase coalition of the willing was has been an organizing principle for how America goes to war we don't need consensus or agreement in the United Nations Security council we just need a coalition of the willing\nAnd therefore blocked by China Russia and the Security Council who cares I we can get our our lives on board and we can still go do the things that\nBig men really do and that is I absolutely the view I don't think cooperation is that for wimps and I don't think the law is for wimps I think it is the only way we figure it out in large complex societies\nTo operate without disaster and\nTo my mind this really is ah the the point\nI Know as a as an economist who's been doing these things for\nDecades that the quality of our life and the complexity of our economy\nIs not the bravado of a sudden businessman it is based on\nFunctioning systems of\nInfrastructure energy water\nFood production transport civil aviation Internet\nAnd that all of these are complex international systems that require common standards\nShared behaviors I and uh [noise] agreement on functioning eye and expertise by the way expertise it's really crucial for us to be able to have clean water in the morning\nAnd so this is not acts of bravado this is acts of complexity and basic common interest\nNow we know of course we I can say we know how many people are for whatever reason in denial but we do know scientifically that we have a shaken the planet\nWith the climate disaster\nWith a profound uh poisoning I Am destruction of the oceans are with a massive destruction of\nThe ... I buy homes in ecosystems on which we depending on which to use another when the phrase I suppose that we are the stewards for the future\nI and to get a handle on any of those is so complex even from a technical point of view\nTo be engaged in this kind of a broad vital showdown unilateral is politics when we are literally need problem solving at a highly sophisticated technical level is mind boggling to me\nWill we get the ah the rare historic privilege in\nThis era of watching another country joined the historic roll call of great powers\nOr the bases it's designed andme materials on research factors affecting sleep including comfort in support humidity levels and ease of breathing details on by about their mattresses and betting at sleep works dot com\nI'm even down there on the next freakonomics radio one of the men who helped rebuild New York city after nine eleven now helping build the city of tomorrow\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century [noise]\nHow old is city look different here's one big thing\nYou don't allow traditional vehicles\nInto the district next time freakonomics radio\nHere freakonomics radio Saturday afternoon at three and again Sunday Morning at for radio\n\n...

for being with us Hi Scott what is the situation seem like today\nWell as you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations that do have gas there very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it's getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which is like there\nIt's a small city about thirty seven thousand residence 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico\nThat's not a luxurious town I mean the houses are set pretty close together and right now it's like every block is is that almost like a scene from a disaster movie like their trees down there are wires in the street seems like every buildings to stay in some kind of damage\nOr either to the roof or to the walls I mean I saw a church\nThat was missing two

starting to really down and folks that this is going to be a very long recovery\nRight now fourteen the gesture fourteen people have been reported and confirmed but I gather nobody there are things

joined us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report [noise] because I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about you know priest molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about and what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever that newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that wasn't that\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that the problem that was going on\nIn my church you know it is I don't think of all and it hurts your face [noise]\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my faith in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell you know I did not fortunately\nNothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who have been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's\nIt certainly seems like that\nTo me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of distribution thing bishops than people whose names are plastered on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abused there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care [noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area some starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I still

comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from my ride all the practice that I still have now\nBut they're right on the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we go to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black women were dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with what I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around ...\nShe started to uh what me when I didn't do\nRight and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police white people would be even a harsher and those beatings just started to get progressive way worse and I think that the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town from her partner also started to give her aggressively worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the beatings that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was gonna say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I\nThink let me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em an individual you started to start as a way of attempting to hide and symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three day and as a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like I'm going to push my body and pushing my body and pushing the body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police\nOr not it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nMan I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing\nI turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date until another date probably for

able to make we aren't able to eat right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the

C. H. cardinal Donald Wuerl over his role in covering up two different church sexual abuse scandals the first\nIn Pennsylvania was detailed and a nine hundred page report in August that outlined sexual abuse by priests in six dioceses over which were presided he was also accused of covering up allegations against his predecessor D.C.'s cardinal Theodore ... character who resigned from the College of cardinals earlier this year [noise]\nThese are unsettling time for many of us Catholics no ... is a young man who grow up in Pennsylvania and one of Donald worlds diocese and moved to Washington DC this summer he joins us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell I've been to the point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation\nRather than ended with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person and I think it has a matter of fact on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you know\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about the parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know pre molesting kids and whatnot but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it when people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal or something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was early to thousands or the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd never been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my faith in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up\nWith anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell you know I Do not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who have been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release some disabuse thing bishops in people whose names are plastered on church building\nBack in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to have the good name of the church I suppose in front of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abused there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new areas and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of all of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I\nStill have a faith and I just much less the connection between my personal faith and the Catholic Church\n... now of Washington DC thanks for speaking with us in

tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother is incredible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from my Riley practice that I still have now\nBut that writer Lee practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and all out of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into\n[noise] well um [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we go\nTo the outside world your mother a progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around ... she started to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those meetings just started to get progressive Lee worse and\nI think if the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive we worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world in our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the beatings that she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing costs just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal instructional I think let me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big it luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women have to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nEnding eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation and I just kept thinking like African just pushed my body and pushing my body pushing the body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police\nOr not it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay with people wouldn't see me as such\nJust make my body smaller like I Would be okay with people wouldn't see me as such a threat and I kept it up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life oh\nMan I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me I'm sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date until another date probably for like six years\nWent to a casino and it's hard to write about harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about a new book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim\nIn one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and help people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to eat right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we talked about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling most as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher and my mother not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment\nComing full circle she really believed\nThat reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer Norman American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her trying to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give

is missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote I you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional ... vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is the complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they said that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under camps office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was
