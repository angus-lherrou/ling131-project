North Livermore\nOn that day when I Know that so many people are just devastated and in shock and calling back into the converse I knew I didn't have the luxury of doing that because I had hundreds as Latino students at my school that we're going to be terrified but what what was during them they were worried that their parents were going to be deported\nAnd some of their parents were she told me only making her students more nervous\nAnd it definitely has an effect on how they learn\nIn what way when you're living in fear it's really hard to learn about things like settles and body systems and I have several students who we've been trying to get their parents to come in for conferences or to discuss their child's individualized education plan\nThat won't come because they're afraid of

this country doesn't care about the safety of people and people on the other side are labeled as racist and there's just no way to to actually build bridges\nThat is how it looks if you're reading things on the Internet but if you're out there and the community and you're walking with us you'll see that there's far more than it does bring us together and divides us\nAnd so you'd be ready to to to federal people down here we are just calling the president racist and say that's that's not helpful let's let's try and work through this\nI I Would do that absolutely I don't know that I Would actually be able to come out and say he's not racist but I think I can say something along the lines as continuing to push that narrative is not helpful what is something that we can talk about that

have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system wasn't is the deal is All right here's our first listener question\nCraving heart from San Francisco California I'd like to see whether learned registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five

neighborhood\nBut then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late nineties early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by makes any

fifties amendment and Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineties amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five built a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is a candidate for governor allowed to purge the voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and isn't thinking about using himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination thing eighty percent of those Africans are members of racial minority groups\nSo they can't vote earlier or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy payment chart and I live in a lot of ... when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nAnd I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office addressed how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing I see the irony that the nation to original residents are being questioned about their residency\nCake you

I'm Brian watt today marks one hundred days since London Breed took office as mayor of San Francisco\nShe campaigned on addressing homelessness and cleaning up the streets and with prop seat a business tax to pay for homeless services on the November ballot those issues are still top of mind\n... guy Marcia Roddy sat down with mayor breed who says on her walks through the city neighborhoods she's feeling some positive energy\nI'm not yet satisfied but I'm a lot more happy today than I was when I first started\nI'm not suggesting that we solved the problems but compared to when I first started\nUm the trash the number of homeless individuals um you know just recently cracking down on drug dealing and a number of other issues\nUh I took a walk the day before yesterday I'm In the tender line and people were really excited um they were happy I was there and they said that they're starting to notice the difference\nYou talk during the campaign about a historic culture of no in San Francisco around the development of housing can you talk a bit about your administration's efforts around streamlining and getting housing built faster that has already been identified as you know potential affordable housing in the city\nI'm excited to talk about it for sure um as you know I'm One of the first things I did was to get all of the departments together responsible for\nUm approvals as it relates to housing production and infrastructure together and we meet on a regular basis to talk about solutions and you may have heard of people who would go to one department and they would be told one thing and then they'd go to another department and told something now\nAnd it was a frustrating process of trying to reconcile what they're supposed to do as it relates to their project\nWhich is why I'm bringing on a someone to manage this whole process for the purposes of making sure that we get rid of redundant policies on that department are working together instead of in isolation that we're getting approval factor for some of the the the minor\nThings that hold that project so that you know just really the culture of no we can't we can't that doesn't work we can't do that we change that to okay we're going to figure out a way to make this work\nThere is a revenue Pete's all of that voters in November are going to vote on proficiency in the city to it to bring in more revenue about homeless services you've oppose the measure I'm Wondering if that's not the answer to you and your ministry should have a plan an alternate plan to bring in New revenues to address this crisis as far\nAs I'm concerned can big business pay more um to support this yet they can but that things like a ballot measure need to be handled more responsible where are you bringing everyone to the table for the purposes of providing input and looking at the financial data\nLooking at jobs and looking at all of those things and how they play a role I Want to make sure that I can promise that this will deliver the result they're looking for and at this time\nUm that's where we're we're struggling with the challenges of props the\nSan Francisco mayor of London Breed she talked with ... guy Marcia erotic now we're going back in time because this Sunday marks the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the great San Francisco earthquake\nBut not the one you're thinking up before Nineteen oh six that was the name given to an Eighteen sixty eight quake\nThat struck on the Hayward fault killing or injuring at least thirty people in doing widespread damage ... science editor Craig Miller says the next great quake may well come in the same place those scientists are still learning about the big crack in the East Bay\n[noise] I'm standing on the corner of Clark and David streets in San Leandro you can hear some road construction down the block was a school here are some apartments\nBut at one time of course house stood here fairly imposing other fish actually because this was the Alameda County seat that is no longer the case of force and the courthouse is wrong\nBecause it fell down during an earthquake in the morning of October twenty first Eighteen sixty eight [noise]\nIt was somewhere between a magnitude six point eight and seven or\nJust about as strong as the Loma Prieta quake in Nineteen eighty nine from which the bay area took years to completely recover one thing we know is that the Eighteen sixties earthquake worsened unusual ruined Bergman is a geophysicist at the Berkeley seismology lab\nAnd the Hayward fault is kind of his baby\nHe says it over the past two thousand years the falls is produced major shakers about once every one hundred fifty years plus or minus sixty\nAnd yes if you're doing the math\nSo the Hayward fault is ready now it it has built up all the energy needs for future events that could happen today but it could also still wait a couple of decades um and then just have somewhat larger event because it took from\nScientists of calculated about one in three chance that the Hayward will break big with a magnitude six point seven event or bigger within Thirty years that's more than a little unnerving as it's considered the most urbanized fault in the country running roughly north south through almost every major city along the East Bay\nAnd so in terms of exposure of hospitals schools lifeline ... um\nIt's really I mean [noise]\nIf you have an zones the southern Cal football game or even just drive down say fourteenth street in San Leandro\n[noise] they're pretty much right on [noise] according to a recent\nStudy led by the U.S Geological Survey a seven point quake and the Hayward today\nThe U.S Geological Survey a seven point quake on the hey we're today could cause eight hundred death and Eighteen thousand injury leave more than a hundred thousand people homeless\nSo geologists have been mapping which parts of the fault are creeping that is moving slowly but constantly and where it's locked those locked portions hold the biggest quake potential because when they finally break loose far more energy is released so the big clock\nPatch that we thing I'm represents the ticking time bomb as we like to call it a pretty much goes from about San Leandro down to free mind\nIn other words along the same southern segment that shutdown San Leandro courthouse one hundred fifty years ago\nIt does seem like the Hayward's benefit jittery lately with twenty five small quakes in the past three months or so that does that mean the big event is at hand probably not Lucy Jones is a seismologist at Cal Tech and an expert on earthquake forecasting I mean on the long run it have smaller earthquakes\nSo you ride statistical test to see if there's a change in that raid and they're not seeing that\n[noise] but we do know something's coming scientists say the best defenses to speed along seismic retrofit like this one at the old Alameda high school and for every household to be prepared with emergency
