studies which link losing an hour of sleep in the spring at the spring forward time to increased heart attack stroke and traffic accidents\nAs many as Seventeen percent more accidents nationwide but before we dive into why that is let's talk about why we even switch between daylight time and standard time in the first place\nThe idea dates back centuries in Seventeen eighty four Benjamin Franklin was the American ambassador to friends\nHe was in the habit of staying up late to write by candlelight\nAnd then sleeping so [noise]\nIn a satirical essay written physician now that Perry he describes waking one more to do a lot of noise at six AM and being shocked to see the sun was already if I had not\nBeen awakened so early in the morning I sort of slapstick hours longer by the light of the sun and in exchange of lived six hours or the following night by candlelight lot her being a much more expensive liked them before\nThis is the essence of daylight saving time in a nutshell Franklin even estimated Parisian could save sixty four million pounds of candle lack the year by getting up with the sun and going to bed when it was dark which is throughout\nThe year due to the tilt of the earth the idea was kicked around again in the late Nineteen century but it wasn't until World War one when it was widely adopted by countries in the war to save energy after the end of the war was repealed\nBut then when World War two came within a month of Pearl Harbor we put in there I say I'm against the same reasons because of the war\nDavid parole literally wrote the book on the subject he's the author other sees the daylight that curious and contentious story of daylight saving time\nForward to and is it became a voluntary and several parts of the country at another point in\nCalifornia voters chose bai proposition to enact daylight saving time in Nineteen forty nine that's why it has to go before voters again if the current system is going to change prop seven would just be the first three step process if it passes the state legislature and Congress would also need to give the okay\nArizona and Hawaii already maintain standard time year round and Florida may do the opposite going to permanent daylight time one reason\nThe energy savings aren't what they used to be studies don't show much of an effect\nDan Kammen is an energy expert at UC Berkeley he says the most recent studies looking at the effects of daylight saving time show of one half to one percent energy savings or even a lot so\n... would be a wash they're not an argument for or against daylight savings time but there are a whole bunch of other features that might be interesting to take into account\nThat led me across campus to the ... lab where researchers study circadian rhythm\nDoctoral researcher Benjamin ... shows me around\nAnd I'm really interested in the way that time dictates changes in our brain our behavior our physiology\nSmart tells me that every part of our body runs on a daily cycle\nSo because we have circadian clocks in every cell in our body every Oregon at our body is made up of cells trying to get time\nWhen our timing is out of whack from missing sleep doing shift work or being jetlag it miss aligned systems like our attention and perception digestion emotions even our blood pressure\nThing falling apart look scary when you realize that all these other things around that have also fall apart and that they're also sort of fighting with each other for saying it's time to flee\nSponsorship of the cake you read the lives dream bike city from Comcast

slam dunk not necessarily it's just that the opposition might not come from where you'd expect many people think farmers like switching back and forth but that is largely a myth\nDoesn't really affect a lot of farmers you know farmers are known for working nine to five\nEvan we I guess with the farmers scaled an advocacy group for family farms\nWe actually just had our policy committee meeting to put out our ... and we didn't even included in our conversation\nThe California Farm Bureau federation also has no position on prop seven instead the hesitancy from other politicians and editorial writers is based on the last time the United states tried out year round daylight saving\nTime and they are [noise] it was Nineteen Seventy four and OPEC oil embargo had sent energy costs skyrocketing

her for two years the problem was it made winter mornings dark and cold there were some reports of increased accidents in the morning as kids were going to school in the dark here's a story and purr row again\nPublic opinion polls show that everybody like they would say return from march to call them but nobody or in the middle of winter\nSo Congress cancelled the experiment early some suggests solving this problem of dark mornings for kids by having school start at a later time and scientists agree that would be better for developing teenage brains\nBut when state lawmakers recently pushed for this many parents opposed it because later times would conflict with their work schedules Governor Brown vetoed the bill and discussions about later school start times have largely not been part of the conversations around prop seven\nSo it seems that finding agreement on the centuries old problem of how best to use the sun may still be a ways off\nI'm Daniel venting kick you eating
