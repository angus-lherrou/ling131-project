witnesses\nDr block the Ford was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that if it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own\nTo half a number one in the class I thought oh no no no no going out there so I'm gonna I'm gonna go I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school records university mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room armed with that same weapon that same\nTool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her trace there's been exploring\nThe idea of women and anger and her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power on women's anchor\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the inter ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious and it was really just missed in a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together\nAnd there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not\nJust running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example\nWhat historically was so threatening about women saying well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment\nBut when they made their new nation they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard lousy enough in this moment I think it's\nImpossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and imposed question will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Shepherd ...\nTask [laughter] so when we think about meat you one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color who were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases that having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was indeed a hill and his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand and six pioneers and leads the me too movement\nAnd then when the me too movement Iraq I think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actors has which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality\nOf the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for granted by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a race\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks in the past ... years\nAnd then we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so is women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and that kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story and it's going to extend it into our future Rebecca Traister is the author of the book good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger is out today\n[noise]\n\nThis is

Indonesia of the earthquake\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's the impact on plea deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this spill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California did not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney racing says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIt's a pretty well documented fact the police stopped search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse\nOr the various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say Sharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect\nNonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist than everybody knows that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges this new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should All right oh I I don't think they should read where people are ending child\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who say they

person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty four teen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our healthcare benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care\nAnd so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently she had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid\nEach hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWhile and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hard ball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you have some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because of the healthcare industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are at five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital there would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called them the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs\nMaryland would say absolutely yes her message really to employers as you need to push back you need to read the fine\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part

smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase or leverage but they can bring down the prices Marshall Allen at ProPublica thanks very much thanks so much

in the past they argued globalized trade hurts their members interest by off shoring jobs\nSo it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal but to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists chat down as a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nHe says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers they're earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that balance as it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper places

like science fiction Arthur Ashe ... at bell laboratories invented tweezers made of like\nThey're like laser beam fingers that can grab onto a particle of virus or an Adam and hold it in place\nAnd scientists can study the smallest forms of matter without harming them\nCanadian Donna Strickland is the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics in fifty five years she and Gerard more who from France made it possible to use super sharp laser beams to cut tiny precise holes in pretty much anything and that's been used in eye surgery around the world\nYesterday former UC Berkeley scientist James Allison won the Nobel Prize for medicine in the Nineteen nineties Alison with postdoc student max crumble and others begin working on something no one thought was possible harnessing the body's own immune system to fight cancer\nThe advances that sprang from their work we're very timely for people like Ashley Walton\nIf I had been diagnosed maybe five years prior who knows if I be here\nWasn't long ago that advanced skin cancer like Waltons was a death sentence survival rates for advanced melanoma patients were less than a year here's ... science reporter Lesley McClurg on what makes immunotherapy a game changer\n[noise]\nIn the oncology unit at UPS medical center in San Francisco and nurse rap the blood pressure cuff lately around Ashley mountains ... she likes the young for thirty four years\nThe nurses made her and her mother and down a hall to me actually is unconscious for ... sake\nFor a second Ashley warmly embraces Dr ideal doubt married now and then for many years\nActually doubted that marriage within her future and she's twenty six she found them all in the back of her head\nAnd it started morphing into the\nUgly dark\nBleeding thing that just I knew something was wrong\nDr surgically removed and then a couple of years later a tiny lump popped up and actually the abdomen\nAnd over the next few weeks it started growing and growing and tell us about the size of a wallet\nA biopsy revealed she had staged for melanoma in total shock she scour the Internet and found the average survival rate was six to nine months I saw that\nAnd I freaked out but her oncologist told her to ignore the numbers Dr doubt told me if there's any time had melanoma right now is a pretty good time to have it because there's a lot of stuff opening up to you\nThe major excitement are for you is on you know using immune checkpoint blockers an idea here is that if you have the cells turned off by what's known as the beauty one BDO one checkpoint which OK\nOkay let me try to simplify to the point is to get the immune system to do what it's supposed to do normally when nobody sees toxic material the immune cells killing\nThe cancer cells are really sneaky they put the brakes on the immune system\nAnd the checkpoint blockers stop that from happening you basically preventing that break from engaging it would it be kind of similar like cancer I kind of like this invisible clothes fit like kinda hides under and then you kind of take off that clip you I think that's a great way to describe it since the cancer is no longer invisible\nThe immune system can mount an attack\nIt was a huge breakthrough when the food and Drug Administration approved a first job to do this in two thousand eleven headlines read\nFDA approval of melanoma drug\nCalled huge step in cancer care FDA approved life extender truck melanoma drug breakthrough stir celebration among skin cancer patients\nThe technology behind that miracle drug developed back in the Nineteen nineties by a guy named max crumble and allowed at UC Berkeley\nI was very frustrated a graduate student for a few years trying to develop an antibody that would do something after many long nights\nCome home notice HIV antibody with influencing the behavior of immune cells you can drive a car you can accelerate them or you can break them and then there was really like play time he started injecting the antibodies into sick mice in a century in the very first returns my antibodies caused tumors to shrink\nNow fast forward a couple of decades to Ashley Walton story her doctors hope the technology could be the key to killing her cancer but the treatment was harrowing when actually started receiving them you know therapy the Ninety minute drips are followed by a slew of side effects\nI started getting really high fevers I got a few skin rashes castrated us\nStill her tumors were shrinking then after six months new lesions cropped up and actually the abdomen so or doctors added a second and you know therapy drawn to the next\nYear doctor right away if you expand fortunately she had a lot of jobs were added diarrhea severe stomach fan of severe knows about it I just\nGenerally felt like the life was being sucked out of me so that you go into a really dark place for several years actually hitchhiked from drug drug just to stay alive there are still many advancements being made in the field of immunotherapy that even if it doesn't carry you it gets you to the next\nBig thing that wild ride paid off she hasn't had an infusion in the last ten months so technically intermissions you're [laughter] innovation\nStories like Ashley are really exciting to on college is Dr Leonard Lichtenfeld is the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society\nSo about ... when we've gone from a time when we had nothing to offer to today and they're talking about cure for some patients with advanced melanoma\nScientist and big pharma are really hopeful about the future there's about a thousand current trials to develop new immunotherapy drugs to help more people like different kinds of cancer about thirty to forty percent of patients still do not respond to and you know therapy\nWorth the beginning of the strong we're not as the are we still have a long way to go we're going to have ups and we're going to have been held\nBack in the exam room actually in her mom

health insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan and twenty four teen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get her health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care\nAnd so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid well and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea and the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you have some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because of the health care industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are at five times and Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital they would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high priced hospitals she called them the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nYou're listening to ... up in San Francisco ... we I of

in a slight chance of showers and thunder storm activity this afternoon it take you weedy public radio it's eight forty six\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep one woman found a way to attack high health insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your uninsured\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty four teen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our health care benefits through our employers\nAnd part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid\nEach hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWell and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge list to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea and the health care world is she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money\nSo she said look you hospitals that are five times the Medicare rates\nCare industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called them the union to campaign against a hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they spent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
