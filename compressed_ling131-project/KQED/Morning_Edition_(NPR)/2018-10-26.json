billionaire George Soros says one of several public figures who've been mailed what are believed to be heightened bombs this week\nCirrhosis of hedge fund investor and philanthropists who donated to causes many of them progressive around the world and we should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDuring SARS has a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bomb or just surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody without to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wants to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important one politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen fifty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a so his ... was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived\nBy separating from his family and I think that trauma explains a lot about it the focus of it's pronounced ... politics and they live and he left hungry\nAt Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance you moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge fund in New York was a very successful\nStock market trade instead of by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars because I was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties just specialty whereas a currency peg than nipped unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England\nCouldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and when the person's right\nOr the pound collapse terrorists made enough food for sure in the u._k. economy are descended interesting chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIf the gun in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his ... he had a clear political puffins which was to build for less than\nThe he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but the switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on democratic get out the vote causes that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major slurring me because for the star us and his allies have put them up to her as to\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding in talk this isn't just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expanding Russian because actually is so that should be a fool the open society Institute He's very open about it he published a figure as a about where the donations go so I think it's hard to escape\nThe suspicion that the critics you say he ... I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where Jewish finance is a portrayed as the shattered me figure to manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a fairly clear indication of that tradition\nWell what do people in his native hungry thinkers Soros\nHe was a hero or early on in the transition away from communism things have tonnes more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism that has taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books in a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much\nSanction President Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris is kind of tight race in a former Republican stronghold against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shifts in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years boaters in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina have been sending Republicans to Congress\nBut things are changing this year Harris a conservative Baptist minister is slipping in the poll behind mccready a Democrat and former marine David ... a professor of political science at Meredith College says the Trump rally is there something that Republicans have to play harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming in on this assignment they still see that raises winnable it would've been inconceivable two decades ago for a Republican president me become into that district\nNick Clinton said because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries\nIt because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham then Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he's got like the rest of America democratic North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you've got\nYou look at the political fines I mean you can almost see the county line the shift between you know the Democratic signs are on one side of the county line and you move into another county more rural county and all of a sudden this country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political ... county commissioner ray Gasper in ... the area of the bad sixty percent Republican but he only elected Democrats\nAnd when his party dominating in statewide office said in the future that doesn't mean the entire state is turning blue\nWe have a hundred and ... and ... percent or very rule which friend to go much more Republican\nWell any Republican chairman ... says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party to the Republican Party just because there is a lot of dissatisfaction with what has been going on at the national level\nTrump certainly could be including ...

control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of rolling with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland collapse he says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how the changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop most of us will be glad when this year just over the agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact the arguments and says that's not a real effects\nBut we are in an election year so I figured

reasonable prices out there but that means we're going to have to hold this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina have stepped in to buy us soybeans\nChina went and bought a lot of buttons from Argentina left them a bit too short they had to come into the world market they bought some from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop but with terrorists taxes and quality to worry about this nerve wracking season isn't going to end when the last beans

like that got raises hollow why now\nNPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the money David ... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on

a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about uh the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit I understand you said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thinks she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah which he felt was the acceptability a black face\nYeah NBC's a nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an abnormal exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor yeah uh uh of any meat of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the weight and network is handled these comments see something bigger about\nThe way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you displace him popular collies\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even

cramming to figure out the statewide ballot initiatives we have some help from our colleagues at the pod cast bay curious today they tackled proposition ten which would give cities the ability to expand rent control\nFirst they curious reporter Jessica project takes us back in time\nTen wants to overturn costs to Hawkins but what he is Costa Hawkins to understand that we need to go back in Nineteen Ninety five\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with extended beyond demand Hawkins rental Housing Act passed\nBy one vote that shapes rent control policy across California\nThis is not laughing at data reporter for cow matters in college and the housing pod cast gimme shelter\nNow cost to Hopkins limits rent control in a few they wait\nFor example in bars rent control I'm most single family homes and contests so most of the suburbs can't have rent control it also buyers rent control on new buildings so is it building was constructed after the law took effect that building could not have rent control on it\nYou can't impose rent control on properties that were built after Nineteen Ninety five\nThe thing is about a dozen cities already had rent control laws and some had their own cut off states that had been established earlier\nThose days were frozen by cost Hawkins so in Oakland the cut off is in Nineteen eighty three Berkeley in Nineteen eighty while in San jose in San Francisco and nothing built after Nineteen Seventy nine can have rent control\nSo anything new in nice looking in San Francisco is not going to have rent control on it\nToday only Fifteen California cities have rent control it's\nReally the bigger cities so LA San Francisco Oakland San jose\nBut because of Costa ... many units in those cities are barred from having rent control in California more than one in five households pays over half its income on housing people are looking for ways to ease housing costs and some are looking towards rent control\nThis actually won't be the first attempt to overturn cost Hawkins earlier this year a bill when before state legislators\nThe skill required for votes to get out of this committee at this time there are three so at this time maybe fifty six sales passage today it didn't get too far [laughter]\nThis meeting is now journal [noise]\nNow that you understand everything about cost to Hopkins why don't we talk about prop can bake area to host Olivia Allen price and Kiki weedy reporter guy Mars righty break down the details\nSo walk us through prop tent what every voting on\nSo basically I think it's easy to look at this as a measure all about rent control I think it's largely about local control this is taking something rent control that's been you know dominated by state laws over the last couple of decades\nAnd it would turn it over to individual cities and counties in California and say if proposition ten passes what do you want to do about rent control how would you like to govern you know the prices of rent within your city within your county\nSo what is the ... actually say basically it's repealing Costa Hawkins and taking us back to the time before that law when cities could implement their own rent control laws kind of\nOn an individual basis and so you had some places like San Francisco Berkeley Oakland that already had rent control on the books before costs ... but you had the vast majority of California cities without any rent control\nLaws so if this passes and costs of Hawkins is overturned what is it actually mean like what happens the next day we suddenly have rent control everywhere\nNo you don't so there would be some cities that had you know certain pieces of their rent control that worse or explosively outlawed by Costa Hawkins if Costa ... goes away they can have vacancy control once again but for the vast majority of cities nothing would change the day after the election or what's the alternative certified\nSo it's not like we're going to have a flood of rent control was suddenly coming\nUp so that we not I think here in the bay area there's really just been one city Berkeley that's put forward a measure saying if proposition ten pounds here's exactly how we would change or how we would expand our rent control laws they want to introduce a rent control on a rolling basis for building so\nAs buildings hit their twentieth birthday they age into rent control on but for most cities they haven't figured that out and I think what you're going to see is a lot of long public comment lines at local a supervisor committees city council committees\nThat cities possibly take rent control up after you know a possible posts popped and future\nAnd in a nutshell what would this mean for renters in California and what would this mean for landlords\nSo I think there's kind of limited actual research on what rent control does and also like every housing thing it doesn't happen in a vacuum you have all these other\nHousing laws intersecting with it I think broadly speaking um the research has shown that if you are a current rent or rent control helps you stay in your unit\nAnd that if you have friends who say if you have rent control and that's particularly true for if you're a senior citizen and you may be on a fixed income rent control can help stabilize the amount that you're paying out for it and they can help you remain in a unit\nOn the flip side the evidence shows that it is a disincentive to actually build housing if you know a a developer is limited in the amount that they can make off of a rental unit all maybe they're not going to make a rental units maybe they're going to make just a you know condominiums apartments for sale\nAnd as you know California has a huge shortage of actual housing units\nSo that's the fear if you take away the incentive for development then you know we're just going to add to our actually shortage of units [noise]\n\nCan kick you in the politics and government and reporters guy Mars or righty and Olivia Allen price host as ... if you're still wondering about the rest of

working in Washington D. C. one person is now in federal custody after a nationwide bomb scare the Justice Department will hold a news conference later this afternoon to share more details\nNow this news comes on follows the discovery of two more potentially threatening packages this morning one of them was addressed to new ... New Jersey senator Cory Booker the other two former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this fast moving story I carry hire new well so what do we know that the person now in custody\nWell not much of a law enforcement source tells me it is a man based in Florida we don't yet know his name or his background or importantly whether he acted alone we also have to know whether this person was motivated by politics are personal reasons or some other reason\nThe Justice Department says it's going to hold a news conference at two thirty pm eastern time\nTo provide more details on this unfolding case only this morning investigators found a package addressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper in New York and also disclose that they had found a package in Florida address to New Jersey senator Cory Booker well a lot of\nAttention in this case it focused on Florida overnight a local police there searched a male facility what were they looking for\nLast night authorities were searching a package sorting facility in Florida in ... near Miami the operating fearing with some of the packages went through that facility and through the u._s. mail\nThey were looking for more devices but also any other clues and local TV in Florida is now beaming images of a strong law enforcement presence in plantation Florida at a site that appears to be connected to the suspect in federal custody a lot of manpower has been deployed nationwide do the postal inspectors\nThe FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives have been on the case as well as local police I'm\nIn the Miami Dade County area and also of course the New York city police department to\nAnd there's also some ongoing activity in Virginia right\nYes in Virginia the bulk of the investigation there is that the FBI lab in Quantico which has been analyzing some of these devices which look like homemade pipe bombs they've been looking for clues for\nHow the bombs were constructed and they've also been looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind no word yet on whether anything they found in that analysis has helped lead them to the suspect in South Florida\nNow that's interesting we'll have to wait and see I suppose\nSo I mean one notable thing uh this whole time is that none of these bombs that actually exploded and so there's been some speculation that maybe they couldn't explode they didn't have the capacity what investigators said about that theory\nOn a record police sources and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether the these bombs could it presented a lethal threat to anyone\nOn background overnight in earlier this morning I was hearing a law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that some former bomb analysts at the ATF have raised questions about whether these devices included a key component\nThat would have set them off that would have detonated it appeared from the photos that were made public that perhaps\nThese devices laughter that key component\nBut nonetheless police had been advising folks as had the FBI to be very careful\nWhen they were looking at any manila envelopes or any suspicious packages because uh they needed to be considered a potential threat and they law enforcement right now even is advising people to call authorities call police called the FBI facing anything suspicious\nNow we know that the New York police commissioner James O'Neill son last\nLast afternoon that the device they've recovered in New York that was addressed to the actor Robert Deniro did not pose a biological threat to not\nUm contain anthrax or any material like that but that authorities were still treating all of these parcels as potentially dangerous and the analysis may not be done yet as to what end all of these uh these bombs potential well\nSo law enforcement officials still have a long way to go here\nAnd PR as justice correspondent Carrie Johnson Carrie thank you so much for the update my pleasure [noise] I'm\nPresident Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris Harris is caught in a tight race in a former Republican stronghold against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shifts in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years voted in the Knight congressional district in North Carolina had been sending Republicans to Congress but things are changing\nThis year Harris a conservative Baptist minister is living in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine David a Clinton a professor of

other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he says like the rest of America Democrat in North

said because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte\nYoung generations of farmers are doing it too he sounds like the rest of America Democrat in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you've got\nYour work at the political finds you can almost see other county law and the shift between you know the Democratic sons were on one side or the county line and you're moving to another county more rural county and all of a sudden it's strong country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray Gasper sense says the areas about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrats\nAnd when he sees his party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state attorney blip\nWhere ... ... and started for sub or for

Democratic party\nTo the Republican Party just because there is a lot of dissatisfaction with what has been going on at the national level\nTrump certainly could be the clothing pitch for Republicans

agriculture predicts a record sleeping harvest this year that China once a major market for soybeans impose a twenty\nFive percent tariff slashing imports that knocked two dollars a bushel off the price arguments and we'll get costing him tens of thousands of dollars\nIt's one more thing that we have pretty much no control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of rolling with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op he says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop\nMost of us will be glad when this year just over\nThe agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact but ... says that's not a real sex\nBut we are in an election year so I figured there'd probably be something like that coming [noise]\n\nAs a key cos elevator enrolling to Iowa the

bought a lot of buddies from Argentina left them a bit too short they had to kill them into the world market they bought them from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop but with terrorists taxes

colleagues at the pod cast bay curious today they tackled proposition ... which would give cities the ability to expand rent control\nFirst at bay curious reporter Jessica project takes us back in time\nProbably ten wants to overturn costs to Hawkins but what he is Costa Hawkins to understand that we need to go back in Nineteen Ninety five\nIt was the year that Brad pet one sexiest man alive Amazon's hold its first book and one of my favorite Mariah Carey sons taught the CIA [noise]\nThat we're talking about housing\nWhere we're\nAt the time at the state was recovering from a housing slump\nAnd construction of new housing had slowed down that's when to politicians decided to try to curb right in the control the politicians were democratic Senator Jim Costa and Republican assembly member fell Hawkins together they drafted at the Costa Hawkins rental Housing Act\nBy one vote that shapes rent control policy across California\nThis is not laughing at data reporter for ... and co host of housing pod cast gimme shelter\nNow cost to Hawkins limits rent control in a few big wave\nFor example in bars rent control and most single family\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with extended beyond demand buildings so is the building was constructed after the law took effect that building could not have rent control on it\nYou can't impose rent control on properties that were built after Nineteen Ninety five\nThe thing is about a dozen cities already had rent control laws and some had their own cutoff date said had been established earlier\nThose dates were frozen by cost Hawkins so in Oakland the cut off is in Nineteen eighty three Berkeley in Nineteen eighty while in San jose in San Francisco and nothing built after Nineteen Seventy nine can have rent control\nSo anything new in nice looking in San Francisco is not going to have rent control on it\nToday only Fifteen California cities have rent control it's really the bigger cities\nSo LA San Francisco Oakland San jose\nBut because of Costa Hawkins many units in those cities are barred from having rent controlled in California more than one in five households pays over half its income on housing people are looking for ways to ease housing costs and some are looking towards rent control\nThis actually won't be the first attempt to overturn cost Hawkins earlier this year a bill when before state legislators\nStill required for votes to get out of this committee at this time there are three so at this time maybe fifty six fails passage today it didn't get too far [laughter]\nJust reading is now germ [noise]\nNow that you understand everything about ... Hawkins why don't we talk about ... can they carry its host Olivia Allen price and Kiki weedy reporter guy Mars or id break down the\nDetails so walk us through prop tent what every voting on so basically I think\nIt's easy to look at this as a measure of all about rent control I think it's largely about local control this is taking something rent control that's been you know dominated by state laws over the last couple of decades\nAnd it would turn it over to individual cities and counties in California and say if proposition ten passes what do you want to do about ... how would you like to govern you know the prices of rent within your city within your county\nSo what is the proper actually say basically it's repealing Costa Hawkins and taking us back to the time before that law when cities could implement their own rent control laws kind of on an individual basis and so you had some places like\nSan Francisco Berkeley Oakland that already had rent control on the books before costs ... but you had the vast majority of California cities without any rent control laws\nSo if this passes and Costa Hawkins is overturned what is it actually mean like what happens the next day we suddenly have rent control everywhere\nNo you don't so there'd be some cities that had you know certain pieces of their rent control that worse or explosively outlawed by cost the Hawkins if costs the Hawkins goes away they can have vacancy control once again but for the vast majority of cities nothing would change the day after the election or will fill us in a certified\nSo it's not like we're going to have a flood of rent control was suddenly coming\nAbsolutely not I think here in the bay area there's really just been one city Berkeley that's put forward a measure saying\nIf proposition pen pals here's exactly how we would change or how we would expand our rent control laws they want to introduce a rent control on a rolling basis for building so\nAs buildings hit their twentieth birthday they age into rent control on but for most cities they haven't figured that out and I think what you're going to see is a lot of long public comment lines at local a supervisor committees city council committees\nAs cities possibly take rent control up after you know a possible posts popped and future\nAnd in a nutshell what would this mean for renters in California and what would this mean for landlords\nSo I think there's kind of limited actual research on what rent control does and also like every\nHousing thing it doesn't happen in a vacuum you have all these other housing laws intersecting with it I think broadly speaking um the research has shown that if you are a current rent or rent control helps you stay in your unit\nAnd that if you have to if you have rent control that's particularly true for if you're a senior citizen and you may be on a fixed income rent control can help stabilize the amount that you're paying out for it and they can help you remain in the unit", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "26"}
