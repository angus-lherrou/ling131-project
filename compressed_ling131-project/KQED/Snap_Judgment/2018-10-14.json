like a nice for idiots because now you're going to her relatively drown in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely start but also get the get the log across the river and then get to safely onto the other riverbank\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAnd came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand in the form of um the rock and he was terrified and there's a rocket laws [noise]\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nAnd I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turn around and very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for\nA minute and I think that's probably when John frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed Abdul handled that pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I were the soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like petting them on the shoulder and they're like little dog like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believe that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to have dual asking what the story was here and up to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nStory was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they heard goes and they praying they mind their own business but there is this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really\nBad guy elected himself president for life and they're not allowed to freely study their

several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained the John ... we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss when in and get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living with skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned that John that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember about that myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands\nAnd the idea of killing somebody and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murder somebody I very much a\nDiamond victims of circumstances whether specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there in the same ... you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashed in their schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and to fight his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys some worry a little bit more bloody than others\n\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain and one of the characters are ... split on now is only two characters with guns to for climate and they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with just really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining and exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken extra time it was when we take guesses and it turns out it in five minutes and I I think that probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering all the time the dance just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd don't seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nAnd do one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard\nAnd that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of set as weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously mess that he had bought the story that I spend a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him to not [noise]\nServed pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there there's soldiers everywhere we don't want to him became shot anyway have Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out he he has this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere just as ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy got two guns and the anger named a knife and you remember it was like all of that and you leave one dumb kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they

he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you could tell they were there were like this is a moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on small ledge and went back and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do that you think I should do it\nAnd she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we can do and believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and we're raising up to class\nAnd it just scrambled\nUp over behind him and she wasn't expecting\nIt at all and but as I was reaching out to grab his guts drop the sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I pulled his heart and they could and he just toppled over backwards\nThe
