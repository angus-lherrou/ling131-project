country sharing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic New York autumn\nAs I rolled into New York city there's something magical about fall in Manhattan It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town feel good and things don't smell so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags New York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone the\nStreets were colorful as always and Halloween had hit the city have you ever complimented someone's costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton\nMe as a hat [laughter] I have\nWalked into Washington Square park who sat on a bench near a dog run there's nothing crazier than in New York dog park\nThese are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyards and rolling hills these are pets that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to be on the New York post\nWhen they finally get to the dog park they lose their minds\nI sat next to one of the dog owners musician named Dave even though he was in sweat and his long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco with a spike the collar and an upper lip and a permanent ...\nDavid lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now in the studio musician he was lamenting about how the city's changed there's no scene for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos who\nAre too strange to live in their hometown but now there's nothing left at the weirdos can afford he said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city there are people from all around the world is that just look at this dog park\nRocco just a crazy my an eerie is hanging with three pose a purebred German Shepherd and the French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with her nose\nLift as New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on the normal night this area's hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous\nThe bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets to me it's the adults in costume were the scariest part is\nWere the scariest part of Halloween at least when the child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend\n[noise]\nAnd they had a down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as large dirty humor\nHis face paint smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused he grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where\nI felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends was looking for where they its worst do did they live in a magical land should I Try and return them to his hollowed out tree\nI felt bad for him so he took his big white hand in mind and walking down the street have you ever gotten looks to strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in this murder for lovers [noise]\nWe\nTried to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no murders that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for a better view the\nPostal department might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailbox\nIs they created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy but when you get to that rounded top you quickly find out it's impossible to stand on especially if you're drunk desperate and dress like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was valiant he\nWasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side frozen like a very koala bears have never heard a live ... couldn't tell you what kind of noise they make this one let out little half Yeltsin runs that broke my heart\nJust as I was about to help three others Merce came running up and grab the mom lost rather have them and knocked him to the ground in a pile of blue and white for\nI felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away have you ever tried to cross the street and found yourself tackled by a gaggle of giant beer soaked stuffed animals [noise]\nThey insist that come with them and get some pizza before they caught the train and the bank you we went to Joe is on ... street sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with\nOne table a couple stools at the window most people just fight through the crowd and take their slice outside I was worried about causing a scene by walking in with these murders\nBut as soon as we entered I realized it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing there\nWas a sexy devil a hotdog a Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise]\nDavid rocker was right the diversity of this town is something else and it's still attracts a large amount of weirdos they have\nHappy Halloween everybody and until next time this has been Tom pop out in America [noise]\nBut um [noise]\nFirst Jeff Tweedy how you ban man I'm great yeah great to be happy to be here [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "28"}
