our own noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak Rosen is presidents of the American Jewish Congress\nJak words fail you know we're so sorry about this room to community\nBut has been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nLike first thought was she was a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tax not only the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was Jews have been living in America is comfortable accepted in all communities around the country\nShe changed since the fifties and sixties and anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities and here we are in one more time\nOr the ugliness not only up to the surface does periodically\nBut it seems to grip a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred Jews make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous year have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on the lawn junior cemeteries schools the SAT on Saturday it was quite a shock to the community and to America it seems\nAnd you know we always he saw the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first for march it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday that maybe at the very very least you know small consolation but\nThere there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm In this country I'm fearful that unless we mobilize ... political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe those that that has been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians those who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that'll send the message and shocked the system you know the answer to this your political leaders\nThey have the microphones most important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphones in the country\nAnd I think it starts with him changing the tone of how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our\nRepresentatives in Washington are met governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue\nAnd if we can mobilize be a little loud voice to make sure that they understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to began as\nWell and actually some we were hearing the opposite from the president has been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same race just ranting with her by marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe in ... meant the sinking that Gary hair pulling the string somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches the target here but let's listen to these nice even in Charlottesville\n\nFrom a documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in regard that had to be tailing\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston\nAnd other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong song being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having a big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all be hard to let him do that but you don't accept that in America\nBut it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make\nIt was just happened to watching currently sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nHow shocked to NBC yeah\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you the wrong county's been setting you said to myself what am I can\nYou speaking of ... leader of the nation from\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why don't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and Trump's Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nHatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphone\nShe's going to have this uh you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nHere in the mail President Trump said that there were find people on both sides in Charlottesville and you're from their permission half as much and I don't think\nThat you you can talk about Nazis and the old right and Americans I just don't think that comparison makes any sense to us America's\nPresident as an actress Congress thanks so much and again her ... her life and your

national Book Award for fiction\nBut secret Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide and tell us about the writing world which the author says is seeking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of a friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together to good news spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and\nAnother was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd ah I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're coating on a moment to literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like seeing\nThat is a quote from Jay and Jay from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more in it\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll\nNow I remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nIt seems odd to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that what happened\nWell when the when the shots started an injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they ... and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean this whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog because you presume it's like old yell or\nYour resume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog and he's going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her her life when you're thinking there\nShe has a life outside the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody asked her to party are you in a woman who's in love with a dog\nWith a giggle mammoth\nBut also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know we do have a person who\nIn trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books in certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should go this is true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there\nWere many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities in what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYeah since they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needed a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work out what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes you most of the time\nBut it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nHe wants to talk about people we talked about site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nOr it could be both ... or maybe it's a friend is the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my with my married are really does mean that is something I definitely share with my narrative she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love those species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horse than dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person to a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet that can live without me\nShe had just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio and the writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do have her only Sallis is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book is called the friend from secret newness and took it I didn't have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who want to wrestle the story of the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience for they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it all about a dog in you know with such a punch\nPick up the friend um and how much this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student writers but it's a suicide maybe when you do know
