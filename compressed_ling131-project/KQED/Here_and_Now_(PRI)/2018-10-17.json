[noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying\nWas not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talked to people here in Lucerne county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him to literally by merely covering\nOr what he said we would get into lively discussions about this sort of said well that's the press his job the candidate says something and the press is supposed to report it\nAnd they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of apologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable\n[noise] what about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump it's still predominantly\nCatholic not majority so there's a rising are evangelical population Trump's um evangelical vote was off the charts you carry a eighty percent of evangelical vote\nSo I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God she believes that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's\nAppointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nAnd that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place uh right now in twenty eight teen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area the opioid\nCrisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and or the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and thinks that it's of enormous problem and just trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump maybe at the margins\nThe unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign he hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really um sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nAgo not the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care about\nWhat about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to ...\nThese voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really care and the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's a personality over or anything else do you think that the Democrats are\nConnecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like was there and county where all they certainly did in\nThe ... twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats what other people that I talked to were Democrats are but felt that the party had left them rather than they leaving the party\n[noise] any thoughts on what might happen in the midterms\nWell I guess I Would think the uh this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats do we take the house but not the center a\nMember of the junior one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse into the minds of many people who voted for

schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to groups the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students head it smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly ... she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of stone in college and historically black college for women\nThat ... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts [noise]\nUm I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give black kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful\nTalk about what is happening for these teenagers because as you write in your book in the chapter calls why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise] it seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening one\nOf the things that's happening is that changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty\nThey start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior plane that sure well\nIf I Am a young African American student and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is I don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said\nYou know that black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that the honor students are black\nBut if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThan you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting like\nIt's just a vicious cycle because very often the kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a\nHigher tractors a lower expectation but what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in\nAnd in fact tracking often does result in re segregation would end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared\nAnd maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed in those upper attracts you\nKnow the ... the little red schools they looked at research it was probably yours in your book to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores that deal not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us to the Boston medical program the\nExpectations this brings us to the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city\nOut to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools it was kind of a failure as first talk a little bit about that and\nThen what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular they often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing\nThere's also may not ... but you had another anecdote about a young black girl who was in a school a majority white and the teacher was\nSaying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how am I going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that uh-huh and the teacher gets so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ended up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like that doesn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically\nAnd also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talking about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study\nUm they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era and some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting and so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black as we're feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about a debriefing soda so to speak in that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful but anyway the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asks why the white kids in the cafeteria\nTheir bonding in in many ways", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
