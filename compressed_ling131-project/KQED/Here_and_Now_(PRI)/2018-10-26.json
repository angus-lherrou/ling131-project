B. U. R. I'm Lisa Mullen's\nI'm Peter O'Dowd this is here and now one person has been arrested today in South Florida in connection with suspicious packages sent this week to prominent Democrats CNN and people critical of President Trump we will be watching as that story develops throughout the day\nThis morning to more packages were intercepted want address to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nThe other to James Clapper the former director of national intelligence and it brings the number of potential mail bombs to twelve and now just eleven days from the mid term elections many Americans were talking about the need to lower the temperature in national politics\nJoining us now is ... NPR's lead politics editor high demand co pay their so obviously we're going to be keeping close track of the story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though is just how divisive these crimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why\n[noise] well I you know I mean the polarization that has been at an all time high for quite some time ah you know you look back at a couple of different era in American history maybe the Nineteen sixties and the civil war I come closest or worse than than today but there is not much in between\nUh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has\nCreated the sense that the press is the enemy of the people uh he continues to fake news at his rallies and a point the finger at the pen that we're all kept in at the rallies or behind the riser is I was at a rally in Houston people were very nice to me going in\nA happy to take my question a lovely people to chat with and talked to by the end and through the middle of as a crescendo of\nJust anti a media stuff so that is what comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who has been a take no prisoners\nYou know I'm kind of politician for anybody who\nDisagrees with that but to medical to president started this week by calling for unity and then he's come to this place of that you're describing now and want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nOr the price of that I\nCould not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the American people they condemn this violence let's not get lost in who is responsible for this heinous act\nIt is the person who made and set the suspicious packages let's not forget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration know clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this but why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nI mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or become the sort of a focus of criticism\nThen he doubled down he tripled down he digs that uh you know that trench and is going to fight for every inch\nAnd you know to some respects but Sarah Sanders says is true ah the people the person who committed this act um is going to be held responsible a it's a just department that the president overseas and that person is largely responsible for what they did obviously\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Lisa Mullen\nI'm Peter O'Dowd and we're waiting for a news conference from the Justice Department just a few minutes from now will be learning new details in our top story today one person\nIs in custody in South Florida in connection with a series of suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump let's bring in Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie a tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nNPR's identifying him as Caesar ... fifty six years old from South Miami and she said and his background includes a long wrap sheet a number of charges for related to drugs and fast and also charge in two thousand two\nFor a threatening to throw place project or discharge an explosive device he also has a bankruptcy in his past and we also know he's a registered Republican you\nSaid that he has a district lung criminal record and the police were aware of him would we knew what led them to him at this point in this investigation\nWe are going to wait to hear from the Justice Department the FBI the postal inspectors in others about what exactly are led authorities took this man so quickly this is a remarkably swift investigation is President Trump has already said this morning\nWe do know that a number of the devices were not exploded so they were in ... in essence a mother load of evidence for the FBI lab in Quantico the FBI lab has been looking at whether there was any DNA are fingerprints on those devices we don't yet know whether I suspect may have left those traces which led authorities to him so quickly\nYou talk about the fact that these bombs did not explode or was one of the big question leading up to this arrest was it on purpose that the suspect with ... you know just a bad bomb maker or was it um you know something else I'm sure that's something investigators will be tracking I ... I\nUm you know something else I'm sure that something investigators will be tracking\nA ... a authorities are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone who came across such a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it weren't dangerous and to not touch it and not handle it call authorities and at the local level are called the FBI so\nIt's not yet clear to me whether this person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber or wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other issues at play in his making\nThese devices are once again we're talking to you by NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to\nGive a news conference on the latest on the investigation into the male bombings and it's happening at the bottom of the hour carry a the a rest do they expect that they're going to be making anymore do they have any idea if the man they arrested today was acting as as a lone wolf\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all the people involved in this right now we know that she's our say August the only person in federal custody I think it's the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help\nAny assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question\nWhat about the white van we saw pictures of it are on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspects because of course there were images\nOf the president there were also ... you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in this investigation but do we know anything about why investigators ah came and got to that than\nWe do know that Cesar ... was taken into custody in or near an auto zone business and that shortly thereafter people with FBI jackets and other law enforcement were seen securing this white van and transporting it up possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes\nAuthorities have not on the record get connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that question we do know that there was a massive manhunt under way for this individual than involve federal\nAnd local authorities across multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were waiting this press conference from the Justice Department of but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of the story a Republican strategist Allison Stewart is with us now Alice welcome to you\nThank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host at hill TV Jamal Simmons\nA speaker or ... or else want to start with you and you'll have a suspect in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this has been a very politically fraught past couple of days\nIt it has been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to the FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehensions so swift and\nI bring bring about a a sense of calm and and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nI I think if we're looking at this through the the political lens ... we have to give some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause of this or the motives of of this is a this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wise to say that anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law\nAnd to write league cleaned and called this despicable a despicable act\nOf political violence and it's time to have peace in the United states\nAnd all of that I'm Sorry to interrupt you ... do you want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to a really want him to try\n'em I support it so far uh every time he spoke out on the she'd get word that I bought something a little light so and then ... minutes or hours later it does or does or something that is to blame on the victims let the media\nOr you know tries to lessons in some way to make light of it in some way and I think because of the um is jobs right now and not at all to exist job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president\nOr do something well maybe he called President Obama may be all President Clinton and awkward as\nIs help and and and made sure that the FBI all the other\nSources of their disposal they were protected it you know image toward the attorney general Jeff Sessions all ages older to make sure he was going to be okay but this was a moment we're supposed to reach out and not just for the words but also with actions place\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those who do home the on the the male bombings or bombs were addressed\nUm but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe the pro Trump ... stickers on the windows of and then he is apparently a Trump supporter so how would you as a Republican strategist Alice advise leaders of the party to address is\n... ... more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks sanity from Comcast extending the Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nFavorable term and I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send a message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and uh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions\nBe heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say that in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a farm in a consistent message and as your most editing need not be Justin word but also an action\nWe were in the you're saying starting at the top meeting with the president a trial absolutely how do you think Democrats you deal with it\n[noise] well I think Democrats would do the same way that is no time to play politics thing\nWhy disagree with the rhetoric\nThat the president has been using so last year and a half a couple of years regardless of the media lock her up all the chance all the things that we've heard I don't want to go through the mall I disagree with those I'm willing to say maybe he didn't know maybe he didn't understand the impact of those words maybe even if he did he never thought anybody would take\nActions upon those words I don't blame the president for the actions that have occurred\nAfter those actions occurred the president now knows those words have impact now we can judge him was full knowledge how he got what he does next and we're so far I'm not that impressed Allison I Would love to see him do a little bit more and say a little more\nAnd one thing that you see what this kind of thing it's just an attempt to sort of terrorize people um even if you have someone who's not capable of\nOf actually creating a on an act of ...\nShe have someone who's not capable of actually creating a an active devices could explode a this is obviously a way to terrorize people are just sort of get back\nAt the other side if there is some sort of political motive which is we don't know exactly the details yet so I I think that's that's a probably a\nBig I'm a motivation there\nOkay hitting was with us if you can uh NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a lineup we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and not to important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI's New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nAh we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderers row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time off age at the Justice Department\nAnswer unanswered questions did he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there\nAs we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's tire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed to package\nAnd there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because\nThey fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate\nUm they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help and what he was planning next if anything ask for motives it's not clear right now there is a a social media account that's been linked\nTo the suspect fifty six year old she's there say off from South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who haven't been to address the use of e suspicious packages and that's one hint as to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience who are we stand now with already arrested in South Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nAh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned that a democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages did he issue a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said I'm it's confirmed that had a suspicious package mail to Tom Sawyer was intercepted had a male facility in California\nHe says we're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity ah during this very dark period where many prominent Democrats had been at a recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions\nThat you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but the so far though the people who've gotten these packages had been critics of the president I'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next door that they're taking precautions in case they are\nI have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking a yellow mental envelopes with adding that we've seen on the news for the last two days of course on some of the targets\nA were intended recipient of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper\nAnd another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet that have\nAll those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAh for the vast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages you know the images that you've seen\nNPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former FBI special agent to teachers in the criminal Justice Department at Rutgers University of Virginia a new country there yeah I'm here yes\nSo you've seen on TV a lot of the scene and have described as as Kerry just did what the packages of looked like it at what point uh if\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks than any firm Comcast extending the Internet delivers in home life by for all the ... has been the home a copycat as often happens in cases like a nice\nYeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know it's obviously are easy to get some of these materials that that it's a lot of materials or are they common and so it's really going to take\nA a a close look by law enforcement to confirm whether or not it is I'm the same stuff steak or a copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of by the ... FBI a lab\nBack in the field office looking at the actual forensics um so it's not going to be an easy call a quick call until it's actually had a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThat the threat is over yeah [noise]\nOh that's that's a great question I mean I I think of as a as a couple of things so first there's got to a charity destruction so um if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have a sense of of how ...\nHow you know what his lowly age what else is out there the other thing is just as Ikle evidence and the electronic evidence is you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records\nThat late give you a really good sense of what he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or this caller business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive these threats are so I Would say within the next\nYou know twenty four hours you're going to have search warrants executed you're going to have a done it in ... Asian or they should have a good idea of how far this has gone with this particular suspect but then there's the question of\nAgain isn't working with someone else a tracking down any potential each other or associates that made that healthy\nIt's ... am hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it'd be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrest that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a white van with all sorts of political details apparently pro Trump ... spent details on the side of it do we know for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the suspect he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to this aspect that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when a news conference aired as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they act\nAnd does the individual you're talking about fifty six years old baby Florida where he is he right\nNow he is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as authorities are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety\nWe have gotten a warning that this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started within the next few seconds once they think you dilute William ... former FBI special agent thanks very much for your insights pleasure good to be here and Republican strategist Alice Stewart hum we uh we want to thank you to please hang tight\nBecause we do expect to hear from attorney general Jeff Sessions in just a moment\n[noise]\nYou all for being here over the past week more than a dozen suspicious packages have been sent to through the United States Postal service through a media outlets a Hollywood actor and at least seven high ranking current and former political leaders in the Democratic party", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "26"}
