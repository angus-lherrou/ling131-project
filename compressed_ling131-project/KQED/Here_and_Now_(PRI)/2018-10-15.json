B. U. R. Boston and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available\nAt Tyco dot com or one eight hundred nine forced to have an auto\nThis is here and now the midterms are three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for predictions tell us what will happen in politics and the economy in technology and in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future\nSo how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of protection Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's gonna happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to earn race bat uncertain and one way that we erase uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nOne the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future our weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro that Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nRight as they always get things wrong yeah ... exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters and one of the reasons why they're so good\nAnd so many other demeans is it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at the big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise]\nUm they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate they are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's going to happen or once you think you know what's gonna happen that will change the outcome\nThis was an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make it accurate forecast but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nIn one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen right it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe\nI'm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to give me the straight good to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some prediction failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always like to say that the Nineteen seventies where the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with the population bomb by Paul Ehrlich there was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all ... they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um\nWell it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened that's\nThat's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as the person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often it's heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well and you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know I said it was going to happen you up\nAnd you know look it's a there's an old saying about the mutual funds you know you start\nFive hundred mutual funds and you to bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big and then you hold up your one or two that had begging and say look at this what a brilliant investor I Am well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat didn't gardener who is author of the book future battle and co author of super forecasting the art and science of production Dan thank you so much for joining us thank you well let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise here and now dot org\n...
