it's also six days before the election President Trump hits the campaign trail again today\nHoping to talk immigration after visiting Pittsburgh yesterday to pay respects after the synagogue shooting Democrats across the country are making their final pitch to voters many focusing their message on healthcare\nWe're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Hummer high there so you were about to join President Trump and his latest campaign pushy is heading to Florida or one of the things people have noticed about his schedule a leading up to the midterms at this point is that he seems to be focused\nMainly on Senate races as he'd given up on Republicans keeping the house\nI don't think he's given up I think Republicans are engaged in the mad scramble to keep their losses in the house as low as possible but the president has been going to red states states where he's popular he doesn't he isn't campaigning in blue\nDistricts where he's not popular and it just so happens that this year the Senate battleground is a bunch of very red states that he won where his approval rating is very high and they're just happens to be Democratic Senate incumbents are running for re election in those states so that's where he's focusing\nMeanwhile he's been talking a as we've been talking about the last twenty four hours or so about ending so called birthright citizenship he said today on Twitter that it will be ended one way or the other even though\nIt is protected by the constitution and constitutional scholars have said it would not be possible for him to ended by executive order we remember that it was a week ago Marta that he was talking about passing a middle class tax cut before the election do these last minute policy appeals work for voters\nWell he thinks they worked for his base don't forget immigration is the number one issue it's the number one culture war issues that he thinks energizes his voters that's what birthright citizenship is for he also is sending fifty two hundred troops to the border\nEven though that caravan is mostly filled with women and kids and it's hundreds of miles away from the U.S border but the ... ten percent tax cut 'em gambit is defensive and he proposed that because the tax cuts that the Republicans already passed is so unpopular\nAnd middle class people and Republicans own internal polls show that people think it was a tax cut for the rich and not for them\nSo appealing to his base but can Republicans do what they want to do in these midterms just with the base\n[noise] well that's what the president's theory is it's always all about the base with him\nAnd the problem for a lot of Republicans in these affluent educated suburban districts is they need more than the base they need independent voters and they've been struggling a members of Congress in those districts have been struggling [noise] what\nAbout the other big story of this week which is of course the the terrible

is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL RN explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also banned vaping in the workplace\nOr you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military these two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the ... commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like it and that's just not fair and not acceptable I think that what the constitution revision commission did is it\nPacked things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but so I wouldn't be popular\nThat's how Broward County top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandated State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county to have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda is sandwiched in between none of it now but by\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom than some legal experts see it this time is different Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not Emory cameras was on this year's commission on the committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not at play\nJust plain logic so when we first started meaning we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection\n... offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens I think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together\nI Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beams and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment needs to be clearly understood by voters Timothy ... is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible and so the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools\nSo that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay justice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they are voting on\nBut the legal filing that was used to make that arguing\nI think that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party and they had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters the where for here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all take who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF just walk them\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years\nOverall the total number of measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty sixteen twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgent specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a signature protection signed by registered voters\nAnd in the citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters has the last say on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting\nYeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year I other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics was another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThe process varies by state the number of senators required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be Jane Q voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group of national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to do something about\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process as a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed\nUm but there's always some exception to prove that rule and there are cases where politically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons for the most part the citizen initiative process was used when the policies are being approved and legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent soon as you see more initiatives you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty sixty initiatives was\nIn many cases to either repeal or um changed the initiatives if possible in some states allow that some don't or to pass restrictions on the process\nAnd then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty Eighteen with an issue proponents instead of letting him go to the ballot and letting it be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where initial comments withdraw and their policy still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it\nWhat is the thought about how useful a ballot questions are\nDirect democracy is is really important in the U. S. um every state but Delaware for forty nine states require voters to ratify constitutional amendments\nSo even if the legislature puts it on the ballot the voters still have to vote on it\nThe question really comes down to win the argument is about citizen initiated measures where you know an industry or a corporation or an out of the interest or grassroots volunteer efforts can put a measure on the ballot by collecting a certain number of signatures only twenty six states have any process but similar to that\nAnd by Moskowitz El Al pay a tax law firm helping businesses and

investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations mothers office has referred to the FBI that women were offing money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him\nNPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so ah there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR from someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller\nAnd what may be the case that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um that that need it was too that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact the between the women involved here in a special counsel's office it's ... it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell there are two conservative media personalities capable and Jack Bergman who I had to be linked to the story to tell us about that\nFBI and well there are two conservative media personalities Jacob will and Jack Bergman who are said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's firm supporter Chris Reddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that is unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call\nThe crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office Muller himself and that is the background for these accusations are all legit accusations this week involving\nA period of misconduct by Mahler um they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report\nThat was linked to a so called a intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified a because no one knows which things in it a true in which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who have those pages where people like actors or models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so our ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these women to say something about Miller I mean what what what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap to try to get reporters to talk about them or none of that is clear\nHowever we do know the special counsel's office has has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\nIn ... in other words if somebody was masking masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about mother and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you\nWell know email earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump
