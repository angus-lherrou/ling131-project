Senate races are in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series this week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen\nJoining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHey how ya doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen or a relative newcomer to politics compared to hell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else do we know about her\nOh just a quick bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist\nShe lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college she was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got under the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada lets us into one of the ads from Jackie residents airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equates to Dean Heller\nThey call him senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political blend first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt Nevada Dean Heller from now\nI'm sure you're right now actually support legislation traditional church but we should declare goes but\nDan Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there but the hell are broken\nPromise and loaded for repeal deciding\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads they have seemed to be making a ... you know this was the vote about a year ago maybe a little bit more\nHeller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change from Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nOr just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or ...\nSponsorship of the cake you read

Fifteen MLA Dutch Shepherd di di di you\nStop telling me what you're going to do and just doing\nDean Heller and get things done forty pieces of legislation to help our veterans parties have hassled\nDeliver justice for victims of sexual assault Dean Heller is our voice our\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking in that had are women\nYeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over Heller fifty two to thirty eight percent that's a huge drop from the summer when and how it was at about fifty percent with women\n[noise] what else do we know about how our other than the fact that he's sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally [noise]\nYet how that's really the kind of become a central issue although he until this race he was a moderate not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote on reliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada yeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste a for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed reliably sort of in\nThe middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved she's been called a peacemaker by the New York times she she called Halloran in and said you know or don't opposed Trump on this\nUm that's what the hell are seemed to change his vote and um they Adelson in turn has a given to his campaign war chest\nIs Adelson a huge player still in Nevada politics huge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest men in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need him on your side in order to hold office there\n[noise] you know this this will be the ... election to see if that is the case [noise]\nUh any sense of how the cabinet or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada\n... said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a shake up it did explode across the social media landscape here um\nAnd and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking a direct question of how women feel about how we're in the aftermath of the Kevin hearing what\nWould you say the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November\nThis election is I think it's not the heart and soul of Nevada I Do think President Trump will
