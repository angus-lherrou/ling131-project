forced to have an auto\nBusiness here and now to people in eastern Russia I told the Washington Post on friday that they recognized one of the men suspected of poisoning former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter earlier this year in England\nThey say he is a decorated military officer and if that's true it would back up the British government's claim that the two men behind the attack are Russian military intelligence officers Russia's says they're just civilians\nThe British investigation that identified the men relied on footage from closed circuit TV and help cracked the case Scotland Yard used a group of detectives detective known as super recognize or people with an uncanny ability to remember face and that got us wondering how does that work\nJosh Davis and studies super recognizing the psychology department at the University of Greenwich Hi Josh and Kenny long who used to be a detective\nIn the new Scotland yard super recognize her unit Kenny welcome to you and you are a super recognize or is that right oh suddenly am ya how in the world the network\nI haven't got a clue unquote lucky and see if I if I say once I Will remember that face again\nReally so if you saw me on the street for instance in Nineteen eighty six when I was five years old and then we met again today would would you recognize me\nI'd be quite comfortable dunk call up to a different little may says to Josh and uh yeah ... ...\nWhen did you realize un that skill\nI didn't realize until I was working in the place and I was told to go to new Scotland yard and get some testing done with don't you just Davis because I was doing very well often find people from close circuit television and I didn't have a clue I could do it until that point\nReally so in it and how does it work for you if you just see a little bit of someone's face like the un ears sticking out from beneath the cap for instance or or an eyebrow is that enough\nIt leaves you'd be amazed last year ... from the back of the head from above who's with all of a\nIs a very strange ability but when it when it comes off you are very excited the thing is every single time my Luca ... nothing discussion on not just someone if I'll be in a row style and you also have on well it's a rock star gone on stage just axons\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time

details that I pick up\nIt can be a button speak on it because you could be walking down the street and someone would walk into well gee they might smile she think oh I Know that person because you recognize the face but you don't actually know them ... and then like a a don't we know you if the problem is because if you will in the same area qualified and you'll see the fights you recognize the face\nHuh do you have to commit the face or the details of the face to memory or is it involuntary\nIs involuntary um you don't really have to try you can just be walking down the street you'll see that face signed many times I recognized some years later\nAnd you didn't notice until you were working with the police as a as a grown man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a kid that oh my gosh I've got this strange talent\nNot us tells me correct or did not have a clue awful that everybody could do to self though it was a natural but let's see if everyone and so I didn't have a clue but the second ... found out what a super recognized off doing the test with those types of ... that's ... huh\nYou are as you say took these skills to your police work and let's talk about this case of the Russian spy poisoning or insult very of course you are not involved in this investigation but take us inside that department how would this have played out behind the scenes\nSo I personally I Know the are the guys dealing with that would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to ... and ... that's a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would not go look for some people or if not with the audience people from the first each\nSo would you use many different technique like linked series with indication Web I Would take time for the postage until we notice and normally scientists and appearing mostly because of a soup recognizes were recognized that person that we've got some memory and then if we did not pass to get enough of it if it were starting to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person we're looking for\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there is some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of that evidence for you as a detective in it in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant is estimated at one point five billion cameras now in London and I think it absolutely marvelous because\nBeing on that said ... which I was we used to get so much C. C. C. become fruits wants a pitch the suspects oath I Would not always look into the suspects sometimes after the victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help self ... people\nWell what kind of cases did you crack\nA very good one more though is a mouse who has a one of ... most wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out the country of the time so I was a in London and I've seen a ... just the stuff that I've never met them before about seeing a picture of them will\nSolve going around in the ... you give me folks details but strikes robbery lost at the same and he'd been stopped several times on the police officers who hadn't recognizing the on London's most wanted but luckily struggle I mean ... when we took him back for fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell us how you found them\nWe did get actual often we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe he got me for that one sided I ah like the ... is a very unique skill\nI'm Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works the science\nSays we think they see sort of a night we think that suit for recognizes a less than one percent of the population very very few people have this ability we found some very small differences in the way that they have brains function\nAnd I think that's the sort of direction that the research may be going and future\nIs it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think it's a different function is it's quite an interesting question that because\nPeople have done research on a world champion soup and memorize as her pets can count hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested they face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing so to streams of numbers in words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that these specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact what was the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities\nNeeding to know a large number of faces wouldn't to being very necessary so so that sort of strange situation as far as the science is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associated with\nOther aspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly too in the super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis ... the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces is well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said we're very very good quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognize as a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut we low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human being\nSee TV footage is a human beings still beach computers I think in the future well what the situation is going to be it's the best algorithms working with the best humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions what\nAre the limitations that people like Kenny have\nA ... a human being leads to sleep unlike a confused or we get tied fatigue there must be limits to how many images and how many people Kenny can say I'm big before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\nWell is really I think an impressive about Kenny skill is he's ability to rule out\nThe huge number of faces the Hindus and they'll say ... to him because obviously when they're searching through CCTV footage for ... you know for a suspect Fritz ... most of the time they're actually looking at face these if people didn't know the interested in vaccines ... super recognize that can do\n[noise] Josh I Know you've worked with Scotland Yard in the past uh we know they're recruiting people like Kenny from within the forced to be tested for this skilled but but what about other places\n... can help find a mattress to fit your budget\nAnd thanks for the last minute contributions made on line we did reach our goal for the fall fundraiser so if you made a pledge thank you so much for your support we are quite grateful\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

D. Anderson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immunotherapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHere's a main insight was to understand how to block of protein on T cells that access to a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably at Dr level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of south than we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause auto immune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Alison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what is that meant for cancer treatment in general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation\nAnd creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments are sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolves including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nUh genes Allison started his\nCareer at Andy Anderson in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nThe NBA Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful argue about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combination of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that\nAre heralded in today's a Nobel Prize awards really open up avenues their great great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter pissed urged the president of the University of Texas Andy Anderson Cancer Center\nThank you so much and again congratulations thank you so much well now to Spain and the city of punted they drive population eighty thousand where you're more likely to hear chirping birds than hunting horns that's because much of the city is now car free parking spaces no traffic lights\nAnd in Ninety seven percent cut in auto traffic since Nineteen Ninety nine freelance journalist Stephen virgin wrote about this he joined us on Skype from Barcelona welcome high and did they ban cars entirely in punted ada\nWell they they banned from the initially from the historic city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extend that to a slightly bigger\nArea which is sort of the ... the nineteenth century part of the city so the city center is calm free and then it it's it's ringing to buy a areas where you are\nAnd then it's it's it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's working out very well let's say you know like most of these things there was a lot of resistance or people you know it was so stay having caused what's their\nPersonal Liberty City um but I spoke to last for the for a while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticize the even though you know this is a part of Spain where tens of rain quite a lot that's on the Atlantic side of spying on people tend to get into their cause when I was writing in\nLots of people said to me that just change their habits are they\nWhat about emergency vehicles police fire ambulances\nWell you know all all of them can get to sit there and they're also taxes you know the rule was it's quite straight to the ... said to me if he wanted to get married and they all said the bride and groom can come in a car but everyone else falls\nWhat about businesses or are they happy with this because you would think that many people would want to drive to get to a shop or a restaurant where they want to go\nWell that was you know that was a business where it was opposed to it exactly on that basis although in those cities is very very difficult to park so the reality is businesses survive better than in some small towns\nOr you know they still allow cause a pony because it's just a nicer to walk around\nThe other thing is that the authorities combined the policy of banning cars were those also banning the building a big shopping centers on the outskirts of town which tend to destroy small businesses within the town\nSo you spoke with the mayor of pointed edge or what did he say about why he wanted to do this\nWell you have you know he basically said that the old city was you know effectively a dumb said it was uh the people didn't like going uh that it was full of abandoned cars that were on\nDrugs and see it within the first months of come into office basically they cleaned it up and buying cars which is you know clearly something you know he said they'd been you know he's been searching into those for some time before he took office and I think partly because he didn't swiftly was you know there was kind of a fait accompli\nWhat about the uh to emissions or what happened to pollution as a result of this\nWill pollution according to their statistics went down within the city center by about Seventy percent or accidents sweat I'm\nA ... to ... productions\nA so almost zero and I think in the past four or five years it's been a zero of either either people in general for kills so you know these are significant gains obviously you know it's also you know general game to people's health and people walk or people cycle\nI'm you know this is what everyone it's us objects and aiming for in cities now printed address a small\nCity many people probably haven't even heard of it but there is a larger city in Spain Madrid that's actually considering doing something similar what are they thinking about in Madrid um\nMany many cities in Europe are about ... eighty thousand a hundred thousand black onto the so you know what's been done there could easily be applied and they sit in a big city like betrayed obviously",
