NBC senior politics editor is joining us now and that I Want to start with that bar fight story as you will know last night uh your classmates had letting ten went on CNN to talk quite a bit about his view of Brett Kavanaugh's drinking\nIn college he said he was often you know very drunk or any of the ... and just as a as a junior at Yale and that he threw a drink and a man and a bar who had cursed at them for mistaking his identity\nAt that point I'm ready to go towards the end of fruit who's\nA ... year the guard so here we are bred and then they were kind of a three guys fighting\nAnd now the now public police reports and if it was a glass with ice it was thrown no arrests were made and on the Senate floor this morning majority leader McConnell sarcastically dismissed it as another attack by Democrats\nTalk about a bombshell want to get all that much of what new bombshell moderate published today or from all\nOkay Beth take this up because money is also one of the classmate who has said that he felt that Brett Kavanaugh lied in his testimony downplaying his drinking\nYeah here's the problem with all of this Robin is it's not these individual uh incidents that people are talking about is the fact that judge Kavanaugh throughout this process or steadfastly insisted that he didn't none of that stuff\nThey're out that he was just incredibly\nAh academically focused a guy that he was an athlete or that he got into Yale University got into Yale Law school by working hard and\nBe incredibly diligent and yeah he had a fruit a few bruise here and there but he didn't have a drinking problem that's the problem he set the bar up so high that it it it allows his story to be picked apart little by little by little and with McConnell I'm Senator McConnell dismissing it like that it doesn't get to the the issue of whether that\nOne thing that might have happened at that bar is so important but rather why is Kevin Kevin up presenting this image of himself that it's simply\nToo easy to be checked and to be challenged by people who knew him back then went and had he done well have you decided that he wanted to come forward and say look I was at a kind of a a a

Smith who a Ford says was there a it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which\nAre his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which ah that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which an incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something that a cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country\nHave you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that our first of flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you have the same meaning it was ...\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection woman talking about flatulence such a sixteen year book page on 'em game\nBut that's not what proved means\nWell it's sort of unclear one booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a boost truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely but\nIt seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right a reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says it moved refers to anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term as your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n\nDrinking game has played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYour plate quarters you know ... ... ...\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are just devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engineer try and go the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this is this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of uh suggestions about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search on books that they have the next I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports\nYou know news likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle that the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically um but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says that a devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had me\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing Kavanaugh in his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drank so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happens if you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you\nCan you answer that question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYoung I'm curious if you have I have no drinking no wonder why thank you\nSo Chad ... who's a former classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it possible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking\nAh I I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank they're often times in which he appeared to be in the past hated\nAh and there are lots of suggestions or some people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point\nIf it was the case that he with some regularity and high school I got drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence the ...\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nAs if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event never happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and there are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is\nA Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS if\nJudge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes I Would think so\nSo they're they're both saying that that line to the committee would be a problem ... how how is this all playing out among the people that you're talking to at this point\nWell the one of the blue sort of fascinating things here is the extent to which the sort of obvious white lives as him\nAre trying to downplay for example is your what countries are sort of given up past we sort of established this on the spectrum of these sorts of false would that are are going to be considered a disqualifying for Kavanaugh and that the European countries may\nNot necessarily fit into that category so it's a well sort of have to see but this is all politics right I mean flakes\nAssertion that that would be disqualified will be absolutely heavily love and by the fact that he needs to consider what the politics are of the decision that the ... and so to the extent that we can say hey Kevin all said this thing about the yearbook which isn't exactly true", "show_name": "Here and
