group or Mike Rowe dot com\nPart of it has to do is um insurance and um\nAccess and a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen a rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd and it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse she's area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using it brought Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about right and it's All right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having um has this area and we're way over\nLast talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to you know do the interaction but that you write women who are wealthier who had insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have the C section and it's and it's and accepted norm in this part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um\nInterestingly enough I'm women that have greater

part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to

[noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen there's been your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... in the United states at this point and while it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of desk could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about their doctors who actually are performing [noise]\nYeah I soon certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they are the ones who make a recommendation for his area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nOn it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress string labor in terms of that cervical ... eye is subjected to that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on other emergencies that might be happening on only brand delivery unit that might put some pressure on them to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as an obstetrician is to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and\nFamilies to say yes um and they ask questions that they generally do say yes a highly what's your reaction to them\nAll I Would completely agree with her or the the\nOh what's your reaction to them\nAnd why would completely agree with her in the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving

for women's health\nI guess or doctor highly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or Tony goal and vice chair of quality and the department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous for Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only do I can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach deer compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this landscape series on C. section came out that Debbie World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says ... and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free a very extensive review of the evidence and they found that ... was so seeded with improved outcomes increasing including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and soon as you look at the New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by mid was in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by mid lines\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst and the turtle and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it has been association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we knew how to model of care when when women had access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows when they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nOr try to go and you work to drive down three down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\nWell first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says area and a first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are and labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make\nSurgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people you see a heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really try to make sure that people were using scientific modern\nDefinitions for progress in labor a old definitions were assumes that women would move much faster and labor than you are more modern data really prove to us we want it to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and ah and I'm enthusiasm for me back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and I said you if you were only from so now I'm here in Boston and so there's this old me mad a threat to the hospital you go to determines more or less if you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so I one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on says there and delivery rates is that\nIf you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another who take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environments the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for national birth\nOr we have a tweeter that's relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make them versus a typical delivery did did you study that\nGoing to end versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report Holly\n[noise] well I'm not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who were having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that um they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for ... to really\nUm level that playing field in in any in addition to liability reform um many in studies that I conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but I I can get sued if I don't do one\nAnd in time or perceived to be in time [noise]\nMhm [noise]\nYou're you're gonna miss me issue of reimbursement is is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery\nHowever the hospital does and that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients on and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S Adrian person is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because it's the length of the day\nJust go to Sharon in Somerville Mass Hi Sarah\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were at mandated by the doctor due to complications so chronic disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get the perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti war and um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just asked if he could labor for a little bit and I really interpret it that kind of it's questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't\nYou know push the baby out that generally and and that was really upsetting to me because\nMy two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here as the C sections were not available to me and I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute Tony are only\nWould I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of those ... and are fully fully\nDiscuss I'm Tony what about this the charge of
