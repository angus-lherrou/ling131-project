ten years ago Trump denies that but did authorize a payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen\nTrump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment\nWill story Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure she joined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about more than the night she says she slept with Trump\nEverybody wanted me to write a tell all and I was like you really don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that ethic you know Ninety seconds in a back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it would be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that are in the interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I Want it to express got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSo like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said how things transpired and why they happened the way they did and the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still sure that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I've you\nKnow it might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you're talking about at the beginning you grew up in\nBaton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food or you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called the liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know\nUm basically what I just said that I don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV's obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the block with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a a feeling for where I came from\nI wanted everyone to get a a feeling for where I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I was and I would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than the hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted it to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos living in small town in Texas was very happy\nWith you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out but then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and\nI just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell the my side of the stories of people to understand where I was coming from and at the same time all these other women were coming forward\nAnd I just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen\nUm I think we're all about to find out on what is a December twelve he was the kind of the orchestrated vests and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it\nYou know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he had messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean and that the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being in the adult entertainment business you know but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there were people who knew about this nondisclosure\nNow my fear lives mostly with just sort of crazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like\nThat but you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they are awesome\n[laughter] but what is that what does that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone would you be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted I've gotten used to it and we become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they're harbored this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask by over\nCompensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceived him at the beginning at all\nNo no not not much ice does stand by that feeling you know\nAsk anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have company is and people in a high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very\nPrivileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack social skills because no one's ever told them now and I think that was pretty obvious and\nStill holds true today how would you describe it today [noise]\nI don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hung out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report in the wall Street Journal this week uh that alleges that Trump personally directed at effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair within ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday I had just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nBut actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news that where you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nAh actually the exact opposite [laughter] rounding I she asked for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over and over\nDo not following politics closely\nUm things yes but I'm not reading the

wait and say\nOkay I Want to ask you about one more thing or that's in the news right now which is that President Trump has been talking at these rallies about Brett Kavanaugh on Christine Blasey Ford

us about this one [noise] you know this album ... by polo and pan it came out last year but then it got re released this\nYear in the states with five additional tracks and that's when it sort of came on to my radar\nUm it's got a very tropical kind of feel that route the album um and I know we're in the fall now but it's been a while since I spoke to you so I just want to catch everybody of class like this this is the sound of the summer I um it'll you still use it next time or two but\nWhen I'm screening albums to looking for stuff to play on my show if I can find\nThree or four songs on an album I'm really happy that I consider that to be a good album or this care about album though has Seventeen tracks and I think I've played something like fourteen of I'm On my show already\nSo basically like every every track on this album is great and that is like an unheard ratio for for my show to be\nInto that many of the songs but there's so many different looks I mean they have\nHave like some songs inspired by Brazilians Tom bud is some daytime disco system club ready house cut some ambient songs that kind of run the whole gamut and what would you say is the ... overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic I mean I Would say you know they've definitely got an ear for pop\n'em but it definitely is more electronic driven and or if I were to Johnny comparisons between other bans I Would say it's sort of like disclosure meets poolside\nOh I like that that's great we had to a site on the show actually they're great um yeah let's listen to\nThe next one you brought up this is the Swedish group by agra boys and this is called sport [noise]\n\n\nSo tell us what's going on here\nYou know what I Am not completely going on but I've seen a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people they're saying if the commentary on male hyper masculinity\nUm when I first heard it I just thought it was a really goofy fun track 'em and it's one of those songs like it it reminds me when I was a little kid I wasn't allowed to watch Miami Vice before I went to sleep as they would get me way to fire it up before bed\nAnd this is Tom ... has the same effect on me every time I hear it and\nObviously funny would you say it's like a good lesson to do you like\nTo listen to the song is an unbelievably find listen yes I mean like ... or after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be you'll be chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and every other time\nAs the sun moves on to become the belief
