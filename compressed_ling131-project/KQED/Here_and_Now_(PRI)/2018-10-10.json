same Wednesday that was further now analyzed by Hurricane Andrew I'm that exact when state of course the scientists will go in and figure out to be a lot of forensics down on the storm Jeremy a we know now to historic storm never in our at least recorded history has there been storm this strong hitting the for the panhandle\nUh so yeah our hearts go out to those in the path of it right now in instill in the next twelve hours jam and we have a long way to go and many more residents further inland and portions of Florida and even Georgia that are going to experience some severe impacts from Michael\nWell what can you tell us about what Michael is doing right at this moment\nWell um we know that there's been ground truth already from the wind speeds we've had a lot of visuals of that and reports of that I'm I'm really concerned for our listeners who might be further inland and thought this was going to fall apart\nUm ... it's coming across the Florida Panhandle in a pretty low terrain area and it's moving fast enough that we're still probably have some hurricane force winds in the stream southeastern part of Alabama and much of southwest Georgia officially a the storm is not expected to weaken to a tropical storm\nUntil it gets close to Macon Georgia a late tonight so there's still a large area of land that's going to be a cut up with trees coming down possibly some structural damage\nOr most of this will be west of Tallahassee so there was some better news for Tallahassee\nStill some some ways to go though some tropical storm force winds there but we cannot let our guard down further inland just because now it's come ashore uh in fact that they're back to the ... still lashing Panama City with one hundred plus ...\nWell what would you advise people who are further and and hopefully people who are on the coast of either sought shelter or are they have left the area but if they're further inland in places like let's say Tallahassee or even into Georgia and and the Carolinas what should people be doing\nWell the next six to twelve hours just don't let your guard down just because you might think the worst is pastor maybe never reaches you at the storm changes kind of shape and structure after comes ashore and moved inland all of a sudden not all the hazards are right near the center you got out or ban that still could spark up a tornado\nA wind gusts could still really be high and some of these outer bands so for the next six to twelve hours they very vigilant and then that might warn word for everybody in the path of this storm after passing as his patients\nUh there is going to be a lot of a response necessary for this\nUm and uh we have a lot of people out of populated areas impacted so\nJust patience for the curious to get

shooter where they have at least twenty victims of the shooter in an area that that\nWas December second twenty Fifteen the terror attack would claim fourteen lives in injured twenty two including Julie pious who was shot twice after her co worker opened fire during an office Christmas Party\nSix months later we met pious at her home where she showed us some of the Mentos she received during her recovery including a star of hope from one of her nurses\n[noise] the the things that get into the nice people\nEven if they have and he said to them to people [laughter]\nSo [noise] you know they can gradually savings lady or 'cause I got an award at that day forward anyway Ken Burns God's last keep renting\nWe've been following her recovery ever since pie as recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona just start over Julie ... joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just went into a new start we needed\nA fresh fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really testing there I became separated from the county when I got my uh medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town safer atmosphere and I just quieter comedy life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and I was required to resign\nI'm On my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am I responsible for medical care from here on wow and how is that working out financially um well my husband has\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay\nFor some of my co workers who have had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher since we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery\nI had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment and often times they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind out of sales\nSo I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were a stain on the county um even for that second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing\n... now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy\nSo we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking the dogs and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start from our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states off so that actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to the law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from that\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he\nGives his perspective from a supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own ...\nOf what they experienced and what was running through their mind and how law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that but just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\nI recently met a a teacher from Parkland high school in Florida [laughter] run into the building to help save people\nDuring that shooting and after I found that out about him I didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Dru Joyce thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through one of those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured\nThat they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and to save the story to become um more\nIt become um\nMore maybe I don't know natural\nOr it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke a heavier views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to to stop things from happening\nNow I I it's so frustrating to me and\nIt just always seems that at\nThe ease a obtaining weapons here but especially the the weapons like the air are Fifteen and these weapons that are made to hunt human being really that's what they're made for they're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting\nIt's made for hunting humans\nAnd it's frustrating to me that they're so readily available in this country because it seems that all the shootings these mass shootings have involved that type of weapon\nAnd do you think that anything will be done about that\nI don't think anything's going to be done any time soon unfortunately now\nWhen we talk to you in twenty sixteen you showed us some

D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poor state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue\nOf cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of the state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that inhabit Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls this Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him of the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking they are now literally a third party and California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will it be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm kind of have brand has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and indicated he'd take a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California to coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas is early childhood\nAnd during the recession state funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown using his indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running mouth\nWas as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump or the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right bacteria is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nI think the governor's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know\nI have property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property in California the taxes are way way out of whack and [noise]\nBefore there was such a move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall drugs if Lori Drew in California can do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes\nThan Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters so uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nOr there are a problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he is not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates are in persuading them to vote for for the Republican congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races\nAnd you know they're just issues and the foreign ability that I think a lot of these a new party preference and others at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on a long time senator Diane ...\nLet's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat\nBecause in California the top two vote getters face each other and the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh hearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some have said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott issued vulnerable uh maybe\nCertainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary\nUh you know I think Kevin deli on just hasn't been here her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this cabinet fingers playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but will you know I haven't seen Broadway but\nOne thing one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old he's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us\nAbout the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California and to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California\nAnd daily an argument there certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we re bind or rewind back twenty sixteen Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California\nMany of them are young people getting engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more ... and looking for a change in the Senate race but as Scott mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability for Feinstein\nActually be watching to had she seems to have a pretty substantial question right now but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversations here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls\nWell that's what Republicans were hoping to your I mean they put prop six on the ballot in fact John Cox the Republican candidate for governor really funded that drive to collect the signatures put it on the ballot polling shows it's not as popular as you might expect a because you know everyone pays the gas tax if you drive", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day":
