on the campus of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks California\nLater in the hour an update on where world nations stand on curbing carbon emissions and avoiding it climate catastrophe but first\nThursday morning two astronauts on route to the international space station had to abort their long after a booster rocket malfunctioned\nMade an emergency dissent back to earth and they're happy to report both are doing well both landing safely Rachel Feldman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and other selected subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe\nThanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure and they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic Landay ballistic descent which is so called because\nUsually they add make kind of added a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rocket is really coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because uh they were supposed to come back down to the ground and the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agency said immediately they would begin investigating around us so far that that's all we know\nWell the good news about it but it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of things that astronauts train for all the time it's not something that happens\nA lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happen but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWell ... ... but with the Soyuz capsule being the only way for humans to reach the international space station isn't this now wait a little bit of a problem there's no other way to get up there\nRight so there are um I Believe three so use missions\nPlanned at that are now kind of up in the air because the Russians face they didn't see again\nIs undertaking this investigation and so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not\nUh you know those chew crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on I asked that\nI mean that there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know if three people on the space station right now but they're scheduled to come back in December now they could extend their stay a bit but the show yes capsule they have up there that's going to bring them home\nI Believe it's only I can only stay up there through some time in January so\nThat is the longest that will be able to say before coming back down and that means that the space station probably will be an crude for some amount of time which is something that we know should be possible there are procedures in place for it but I don't believe it's ever happened before\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nIs less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems how does all of this affect voting behavior\nAnd our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... and it's nice to have you um\nLarry I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they're trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team when we're there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] the kind of political purchase a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things or if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nAh we saw them targeting\nA voter registration databases again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against 'em or election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers eat pull books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on\nI think um [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the machines or maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there is this something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still uh uh not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to attack them um and again they manufacture pull books and and a deal with registration databases\nUm electronic books or what you kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or or or or computers that are used to ... people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I last checked and I think they have they they may have denied that there were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the smaller indictments there was an indication that there was something\nThat sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised well\nI'm I'm well that's actually quite a controversial question I mean you ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways\nUm you know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructures I think um if\nWe're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines\nAnd systems um the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines used in several states um or\nPotentially the scanners that are used to scan scan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um\nQuite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities and so what we do know is\nThat if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known that um you know a a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the um what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being a retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually a defective attack on them um you would need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and would be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community think it's easier to actually affect this type of kind of\nBrute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nDuring the day right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one\nSide of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities and are taking 'em um our inner taking steps to try to um\nTry to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election be there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we are doing that\nUm there were mistakes made but a skeptic\nCan I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but\nWouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there were mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking\nThat the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well\nTaken care of and are highly unlikely to be subjected to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the states to move in directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I could just jump in real concern I point um I I\nI I think that to build on on what Charles just said uh I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's all they're all there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course is connected to the Internet um\n... the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or freedom theater ... death dot com\nUm that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states\nOr that I Know of but in other countries are election reporting attacks um and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out on social media were I was talking earlier about that level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in in in a Thirteen states at least in in some polling places and Thirteen states\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as\nRising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages in and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close\nIsn't in more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius\nBut how much does half a degree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change VIP cc this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even at one point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly da Vinci is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much great to be with you\nOn the treadmill to shut out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one of the after ... increase in global temperature oh you were each are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at science friday I'm so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nBut even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big change\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right so the parents are Grumman actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming as one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius\nAnd they found that indeed we are definitely not on track on and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd for example\n[noise] except for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to as severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming if you think about it on sea ice free Arctic in the summer and when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming\nThree times worse for insects I'm\nAlmost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me which for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of the further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent I which is just tremendous you know\nIt doesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay under two point zero degree\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen on to make that transition happened on right now\nI Am missions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent they're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty instead we essentially need to have\nThat amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year\nBy twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century so this is a tremendous transformation and the composition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about and it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty or talking about renewables projected to fly Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity I to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices on a lot of different measures I which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but not at all we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the report won't go there with that can you can you answer at least two commission do what they do they use [noise]\nShow or a show on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bike has a gym presenting this dog on a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November for that the region or freedom theater at the gym and stuff dot com\nPart together on and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nAnd had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically attach all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case and there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea on about a week ago\nAnd that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators con make sure that they feel comfortable with the times the implications for policy makers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report [noise]\nMm [noise] ah we're a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janet's in South Carolina Janice [noise]\nYes hello so so I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up confusing tape but when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what\nReally hurts us in our culture\nIs the high temperature is a record high so for example in the Midwest is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to jail or in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes when the pilot temperature is very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen\nAnd so this is really critical or the highs not just the average temperatures\nAnd it takes us back right away more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American force grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the outer atmosphere it's cool the planet at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientist will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...\nOther things like that that will instill make us grow more\nPlants and we didn't have them for food feed him till I oh you are you a farmer [noise]\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I had a small farm and on the developer energy cheaper which makes food for food feeding fuel all of the same makers and the use as little water and\nYou know everybody thinks we're going to have some you know puts the two of the atmosphere what all the plants will take it up if we switched to the renewables using plants\nBurn it let me get a comment thanks thanks for your call what about the can we saw some of the sea of to reverse some of the\nThings on it
