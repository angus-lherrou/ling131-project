over immigration many California cities have taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement\nIf if you quote unquote broke the law by coming to this country to work where there's a word up plenty that's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody four\nOr five voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice\nThis is really about rule of law and about to local control\nThis year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities the law sb fifty four is called the California values act it's also known as the sanctuary law and his drawing lawsuits from the Trump Administration in several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alameda which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union list Alameda city manager ... ... says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and taken action to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going in challenging us on that issue [noise]\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around a look down on me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal thankful for what we're doing because what we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by the sanctuary laws what happens with these people that are bad actors that are illegal and that gets\nOr are they feel that basically by us not abiding by the sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um [noise] I I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she is a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait and turned to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I'm actually I'm One of them with my wife as an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with loss Alameda in defined the state law mark ... is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest high\nHe says the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking I feel that\nThis has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and the public safety issue it just ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took admitted to actually learn what we did I think they would be we're we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally are abused I've met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThe immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\nBecause he says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other studies in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a century city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied bending the days is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of Sendai not about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our residents that they're going to be treated respectfully with dignity\nAnd at the stadiums here to serve them well we we spoke earlier with the city manager from last telling me that she said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that's not about racism why um why I'm doing this\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city will selling me to take the position that they did other than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city\nAnd that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what\nThat he is a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land\nHe oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and I do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminal should be hounded ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you're only crime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that\nI see that uh they said he should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David balancing\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is certainly what we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers um we responded behaviors responded criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from I say it makes their job more difficult what do you say\nTo them so federal authorities um are you know that they have the mandate to um to enforce federal law\nUh we do not and so it's like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law and the and and they do that so um the other pieces has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are they called me right so um the ideas to\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting

Chen or freedom theater at the gym at ... dot com honey we\nRun one of the largest jail systems in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump when there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates at our custody for local crimes not for ice issues\nAre here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place they detain are on\nSo it isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates who ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can communicate we're releasing them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day first of a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returned to the communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that's happened\nWe know of as of since January first we've had seven hundred and Seventy two through September this year individuals' criminals in our care to ice had place to detain are on that we could not\n\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters to approve of President Trump or so I mean do you what do you want that support do you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat\nLook it's a it's a bit of an oddity that's for sure and my values and my values and my values as the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education or my mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to seek a better life so I'm as the author of century state or for California I'm\nAs the leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage to the highest in the country Fifteen dollars an hour and\nAlso the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo the carbonation agreed um my values have always been for working families in California and that's why I Am I'm my goal is to be a new voice for a California's in Washington DC and\nNow it's a it's an interesting attitude that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down the state of California doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice it's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if you become the senator from California\nWell I can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this was a man that was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity tore values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency are John Kades tickets they even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nI'm either Democrats I'd be disappointed but I'd get over it in a couple of weeks and try to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country a forward together um within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that I didn't fight from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can't allow one lick tall aberration reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou've criticized Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of\nGross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations for words sooner a Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated do you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a politics I don't support the investigation of Sarah Dianne Feinstein but I Would have taken a different approach to Brent Kavanaugh on two separate count so I Would never have open the door to his confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nSenator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man ain't no partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation\nAnd I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's judicial nominees now these are as we know lifetime appointments and these are men who [noise] um oh surely will undo a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights\nA voting rights are environmental laws so [noise] uh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked so what can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent a cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things I did they have\nTo um you we witness um junior senators such as ...\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October ninth through November fourth ...

C. especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate seniority has not been working for California and I think that's what they want in today's day and age when we have a president who occupies a White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity to our values and more importantly to our people to eat I think she is fighting for California [noise]\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California to the rest of the country um I think that the comedy um and there's bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine a workers' rights women's rights are voting and civil rights as well as our environmental laws are I think it takes a different type of representation in California wants a real fighter that will fight for the values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday\nDo you think the Democrats should try to impeach President Trump if the Democrats take back the house in as\nWell I've always said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a an impeachment of uh the current president I'm\nI have not been dissuaded or for the position of taken it is not a partisan position of taking I don't think Democrats or Republicans should play around with the idea of parts of the ship for political purposes or this is based on a legalities\nAnd being the commander chief the chief executive officer of the most powerful position in the world I think there's sufficient evidence uh for the members of Congress are regardless of who controls are either chamber to move forward with impeachment now obviously\nIt's clear that the Republicans don't have the courage to move forward and do the right thing but if the uh the house has taken over by Democrats I Believe strongly that they should move forward with a impeachment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11"}
