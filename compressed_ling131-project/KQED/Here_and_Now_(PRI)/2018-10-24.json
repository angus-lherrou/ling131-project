Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout stars of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump David Ron dissent is as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education\nHiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gifts to Gail I'm against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here and at the very least we wouldn't need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now are the Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to healthcare you said you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American he was also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's had his\nTallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nThe missile defenses described ... community as one where people are sheltering themselves and homes and avoiding the streets and he's it clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognized that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if communities do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices\nCreated reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high\nLaw lists uh you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in\nReality I Want to see that President Trump you know in your debate with Ron Santo as you said he was this huge for the president you may know about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is with ads of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nPresident Trump's polling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refused to do with\nA I'm teaching my kids or what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr disasters he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and commonsense to our body politic more people have to

will be proud to grow up in\nIran just answered said if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how'd you didn't work or the ... all this money on many for the environmental plans that you have for the state\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with a check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with\nPresident Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement tried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama's stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Florida two point eight billion dollars\nI'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure\nHelp on transportation Rick Scott who again don't agree on a lot politically during this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent present is is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants the reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting governors Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of photos capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we\nSponsorship

some exciting racist to watch we've talked about the governor's race between Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for US Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane here's some what we're hearing [noise]\nBecause he had the Democrats\nI'm a Republican some of the road right now Republican candidates type cross the border I agree with\nI get you up with these funky\nThis is the situation\nThat Wendy Alaska's in Miami also with her Miami Dade rosy Patel let Jake Bernstein in Alexander ... healthcare President Trump\nCan the sitting governor the Republican Scott I'm the longtime Senator Bill Nelson has a lot going on to lead to convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and make as an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami Jaime gay Hi Robyn I'm getting closer to you and your state and I'm Glad [laughter]\nAnd when they hear in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin thanks for having me on well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat and to kill him as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets Hamilton Hamilton makes it this way\nAnd his share of a vacation that a couple of friends took\nA you know it's just one trip that he took these as gifts from develop as it turned out to be an FBI agent and I and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story the text\nIn which a gala his friend a lobbyist told them about this Hamilton ticket or that this developer hat to them Gillum respond awesome\nBut he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket is it's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent has been some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions I mean almost undoubtedly the dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think\nI think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers a question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive I'm a chair and dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship what the president and keep people in the administration Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources which been a big problem here\nAnd we need to work constructively with the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for ah but I don't think he got to be able to do anything productive already with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWhile I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary\nUm to to ... you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying or\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and being being disastrous was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided well\nSponsorship of the cake you weedy life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X Kennedy on demand\nCards deafening Theresa's tweeting support for a candidate\nEnrique I said they don't let me bring you in here because of president also has told a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugee some say undocumented immigrants making their way you know through Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are going to be like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack\nOn the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the Caribbean and same they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged garb and are they very convenient time for the president\nBush said that the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... ... all the coverage and all the attention described and has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nOr will see that on a ... depending on the journal both parties I think I read as he was a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a candidate that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was the size\nOf group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last ... then it may get so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people uh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point and Florida is a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr someone just stayed in two thousand and sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans that many of them who were already in Florida before money about all the ... Hurricane Maria over a new Puerto Ricans have seems a coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in that result\nUh for for the governor's race in ... in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not among a lift ticket from unit [noise] different interest and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum\nWill kill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise] their house has voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher facts higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out or so after and tell them why because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh daily from Terry in his you here in Tallahassee always colorful but whose ... year and I especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's Rufus and ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the ... year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "24"}
