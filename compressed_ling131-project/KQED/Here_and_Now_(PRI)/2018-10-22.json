worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are\nOutraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory\nIn the middle of the night but\nThen what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their stories told and the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram\nIt airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Kelly is with us as Well hi Sasha I think he said the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we host the ... the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the details about why it happened to the gym mystery is how 'bout that kind of on why am partly a mean day was you know the government's his cane they control the narrative but also we\nGovernment's his key that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them and not governments safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only be now to captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite rules they um with still processing wanting to happen to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when our counselors to push them into reliving and telling as well as it happened\nThat we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to buddy clearly anytime we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shopping down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government will say I wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the girls time in captivity because they were held for three years before and it does say she was down and they were really well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to is they did give us that diaries discreetly it and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and then the phone what we do is\nThe uh the does the book goes who have taken was actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of dollars in Nigeria who was taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the ... foot girls as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid is I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's of Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the sound is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... for you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a sell to the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that wide say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we ... like she\nShe did tell us I don't love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have just a pet either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay well ... has been kidnapped in children but I Will say older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nAnd then when the military engage with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and arrest ah people who looked like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is astonishing I think all the focus being on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these they called them id Pete times uh intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run through 'cause Boko Haram you know they've done just could not they then button and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to learn\nAnd that they're ... but then a lot of the uh loves entirely displaced people end up living within the community save\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have the skate spoke on her um but they will have an incredibly welcoming to the numbers displaced people who have come to made it very\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nI mean I'm made a gory is in a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize control the Nigerian military and that constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city\nSo when we with that like the second to last night that happened to be the end of Ramadan that was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know who to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women\nSponsorship of the cake you weedy life's dream bike city from

[noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI seem\nI'm not a hint ... because of it has it changed my life [noise] now on me I'm ...

got a peek at the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy ...\nMore than one box afterward only why do we thought for skin they listen to ... take on French I'm with a five minute we can we say live for\nThe addition sponsored by Google ...\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brands of content or the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and\nAlso trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAren't let's take this first change Fox is calling it the Ninety nine second sixty seconds ... be nine sixty seconds break jazz pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second you this has got a problem when there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd also the goal of the branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute blocker branded content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically upstairs you to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for the\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox split advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain it\nJohn Carroll here now media analyst thanks very much and I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThere are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam date is founder and CEO of the company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost two hundred fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd some get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own source that are buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disruptive and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specific how get around works uh right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYes so you don't let her out you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone a lock the doors and Dr ...\nAnd you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way\nYes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of ...\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's Toronto which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go at something like ...\nSponsorship that the cake you ET life's dream bike Kennedy from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with the Kennedy on demand\nAre from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nYour so I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty shifting\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving always from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with rumor or where they heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete shutter for solutions to the market but\nSo you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility and equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for that money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like Toyota ... versus continue investing was partnerships and expanding or Russia or partners\nWell speaking of rubber and Toyota neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and something that we've since day one and\nSort of very aware of in fact it taught us cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself\nWould you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people with different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace I get around checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road I tell them to see a cold are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than drop it off and then that would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in a world where for fifty years out in the town of me as sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where\nYou know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of city in suburban areas\nUm any of those curves might be self driving but they're fundamentally not you know self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network functioned is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close to even what we do today right we help owners\nShare cars efficiently in urban centers across the United states and we work with partners you know who helps ... cars or keep them on line and and continue to operate the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22"}
