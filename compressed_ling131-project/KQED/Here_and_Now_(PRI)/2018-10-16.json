throwing shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now\nThanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's\nIt's just something that ... as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen it became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate\nWhat is happening is not normal\nAnd I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary\nAnd how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know gold and ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like kind of like the old curtains better\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro that Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at for Mike Rowe dot com\nOr said that I was throwing shade on the new\nA new president you didn't even know what that term it I didn't even know what that term that after you know I started to pose some more and then I heard the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen the biggest crowd in history was really an January twenty two thousand nine\nHuge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it\nI mean a kind of picture says it All right right\nIn that case maybe more than any other than that that the picture was what prove what was true\nYes I Do get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentaries is ... very rarely is there a negative feedback in and what's interesting to me is\nIf I'm if there is uh my uh it's ground followers are have my back and they they ended up commenting back to the streets and they often point out to me\nAre people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know what they're rushing botched but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my ... just in saying what they want to say\nThis book I you've got a often either Trump tweets alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post is one I'm looking at right here\nA President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote stuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest I mean just say you're staying at bed Bedminster because you want to play golf and but to just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a\nYou know somebody in cheek right folk poke I guess\nWhat's the one that you're most proud of\nThat you like I Can't believe I thought of that\n[noise] ah the the [laughter] I after I correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\nYou know a Trump does always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points in all caps are in regards to the\nFBI and investigation um [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that the more people that have been racing and he said\nForty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other networking you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty times they've addressed on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama's was a two thousand ten states union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happens you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked that I correct myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong Eun and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff\n[laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a old owner John ... and I said there's only one rocket man\n[laughter] [noise] ... what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in a coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now that the book is actually printed\nUm I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it\n[laughter] or at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nDo you have ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post amongst around\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public offering the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use them there's another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so so what\nMine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you would you want to do something else [noise]\nNo I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from\n'em at least us politics for sure how come [noise] um because I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had\nA dynamic a a\nPerson to a photograph every day\nUm someone that I had you know admired\nSomeone who gave me incredible access and I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could\nAnd and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened\nUh because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn 'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nThe announcers and technical staff of cake you wait the radio or affiliated with the national association

available at legal zone dot com slash\nNow\nIt's here and now should students be grouped by race this year the little red schoolhouse or progressive private school in Manhattan decided to end an experiment a grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents are the minority students objected caffeine is director of the little red schoolhouse it tell us first what was your thinking in trying this\nOr we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement\nWell you said that are part of this was based on you know research just looking at a temp to isolate the minority students tend to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms\nLooking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school um that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research in this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being\nMade about them based on their identity and then as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing that being part of a larger group having colleagues as supportive of their development and other academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students to have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experience isn't that affects the minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's much much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student in and out of place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those and even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nAnd this is an unheard of in twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial or gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were getting for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nThat you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated hung on that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I I Would say two things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school and the idea that we would you know I'm actively group of people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice that's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room\nHaving a parallel experience to the other home room and the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from you know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school [noise] so what happens now a huge drop the homeroom experiment so how do you move forward\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what a what a lot of independent schools do which is to have race be one of the components of the students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan uh where you have ended this idea of grouping minorities together in a home when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remains somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so a lot of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan so thanks so much it's been a pleasure and tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educated who says there are times two kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise]\nOkay one smile go now to hear now outward and see the finalists in the annual comedy wildlife photography award photographer Tom tell them is a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom needed just a finalist how will you choose\nWhat isn't very good question like she has made the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I don't have to think about why I just that's how I view my every just like\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can often have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of a school cans are held out his mouth is wide open I think the thing it's got caught in the act from photographer marry him a gallon I mean that's laugh out loud\nIt allowed and that any one of my favorite\nI think it's actually possible just to see the animal and then think of ... that animal thinking something goes through your mind very quickly I had the vision of showing up in United her showing a new name will go to Brandon [laughter]\nIt's just a few different well other people you you said you see all the girls think do you know people's different names which is why I Love this part of the ... humid on different levels every one\nYou see well yeah I got gel nails this time we [laughter] then we have that to a komodo dragons this photo by Sergei savvy it's coal Martian [laughter] and their tails are whipping behind them and they're in an embrace and they do a little like a little Martian like\nThey do the motion like and I'm actually they shouldn't be cold komodo dragging their their relatives ... what they are I think Bangor monitors but when you see them in the bachelor they embrace dumb thing they don't see no I don't think oh and bracing there could be fighting but\nIt kind of fit that temperament they are being friendly and sleep\nWell and they're probably you know they just got stuck together or something and they were signing can't see them that they are not thinking but that's a part of it if it's about anthropomorphizing some would say um there's the exasperated grizzly Danielle ... he just looks like a guy behind you know what what next", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "16"}
