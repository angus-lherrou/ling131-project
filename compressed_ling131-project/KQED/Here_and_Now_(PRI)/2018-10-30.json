S.\nAnd Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation that mirrors what the president wants to do\nJoining us now as Alan Gomez who covers immigration for USA Today huh Alan Hi German and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which are reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and of the state where in their reside\nSo how could President Trump or undo that by executive order\nTo very good question um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight but as the U.S Supreme Court\nWho to throw in one more quote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms\nSo that's a pretty high legal hurdle to to climb when something is in law in the U.S constitution and upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some conservative I'm sort of anti immigration groups in recent years who have seized on the phrasing that you said subject to the jurors to extend their of\n'em they're claiming that somebody who's an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national of their home country they're claiming that people who come here um through birth tourism so a Chinese think of a Chinese national coming to the United states when they're pregnant\nGiving birth here are just so that their child has US citizenship and then returning back to China they're claiming those kinds of cases um do not fall within the fourteenth amendment um but as we've heard from those from the amendment\nAnd from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal hurdle to climb well\nThere are many who will look at this and say we're a week before the midterm elections and this is just a political move that he wants to excite his base even if he doesn't have any intention of actually doing this or he knows that it will go nowhere in the courts\nYeah the timing is incredible because it's not just this I mean you look at the fact that he has been hammering on the migrant caravan coming up through Mexico for weeks now I'm declaring it a national emergency and just this week and his administration announcing that they're going to send five thousand\nActive duty military troops down to the U.S border to stop them that's on top of already Twenty one hundred National Guards men that are down patrolling the border to stop what is now about thirty five hundred migrants um that are trying to make their way up\nI'm so there he's really seizing upon immigration I mean this was a strategy that worked for him obviously in twenty sixteen and when they're trying to combat what many are predicting will be this blue wave in this midterm election\nHe's just going back to the playbook that worked for him and saying hey let's just hammer down on immigration over and over and see if that works\nSs ...

eight hundred nine four seven auto\nThis year and now we had the rare opportunity last week to speak with Alan Greenspan the man who led the Federal Reserve from Nineteen eighty seven to two thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think the space recruiter combination of not worth the feathers during which remember short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and trigger thirty year treasury bond very moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nTo impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian willed rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWe have more than two it's more directly related\nTo her structure new company for example the so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which are very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of who very new\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whatever your grocery and areas or worse for being prices from pre ... or whether you're on the west coast or\nWhere the issue of heart took stock prices were everyone talks about so the only thing about this country is very diverse and if the parents wherever you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge of this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much lower\nTwo thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future\nAll we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity flying uh well basically because fear you know when to deal with fear is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it and the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks in the book and so I might add discussing was all over the long term outlook is all about\nWhat we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show\nIs that in title ... which are mandated by law a gradually having an extra bleed browsing out gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar on so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners but what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging right thousand official actuaries of the Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds\nAnd balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent and definitely into the future do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFirst of all do I think it's going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there so long as you\nDon't do it cause the overall total government that is all over the rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation\nWhen you say inflation is a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates and ... century bc Greece but not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat you say to people who say that you kept interest rates too low I joined the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nRecent we should've rates low as ... unemployment rate so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace and the dot com boom which now moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did we move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below a brief usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept fooling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo it is does low interest rates were not a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that into that and so I\nThink that what we specifically learnt strangely for the first time in two thousand and it is there are two conditions is hard for crisis\nOne is a toxic asset lies a secure at times to mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and one day or financed by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell I don't know general\nNow that that was just extraordinary period or to narrow it it it would have been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep rates down during that period of very low unemployment\nThat was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are\nHaving a difficult time in many cases hiring people and their dad it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's it's not lower productivity but it's an issue or when you get to sort of tight labor market\nWage rates begin to Iran has of necessity and it's the wage rate rises which affect the cost of production\nRate rises which affects the cost of production and induced corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up that's where the problem is if I wasn't really big on\n[noise] I Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talked about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nOr creative destruction is a process by which people do two things they continuously dressed but the investment is displacing\nOlder clip but more importantly it engenders unemployment the\nIt's the process where Trump fortunately it was a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically this report in the book and it was the result of creative destruction\nWhich means essentially for example when a open hearth runners

Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married\nRoberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrels all\nThen this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that I'm afraid to enjoy the community that diverse than the diversity in the community is for all hell\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches\nUm that all made him feel at home um that they creams that delicatessens and the often commented that he could hear the emotion Hebrew and a dozen other languages spoken as he walked down the street that community\nHe actually learns uber didn't pay get gas or do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on scroll hill\n[noise] um\n[noise] they're not just neighborhood I think I'm certainly had\nSome of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhood neighborhood is make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think what's reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd probably also taken the lead troops community where I grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and a puppet Daniel tiger had this question for lady ...\n...\n[noise]\nHave you read that would a lot today in\nAnd I didn't know what it means [noise]\nMeans [noise]\nSomebody getting killed in\n... you know\nThat as\nI Know a lot of people talking about it right now many people are talking about a lot of people are sad scared about it you know [noise]\nThat talked about some other day and if you like [noise]\nThat sound or courtesy of the Fred Rogers company late ... lady overland goes on to change\nThe subject to a picnic but Daniel tiger says he doesn't feel like a picnic a she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] I think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid and there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to ground that's where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said what's that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers and firefighters the ambulances that doctors the nurses everyone\nUm has surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with some of the identify with the helpers and not those who who are cause destruction\nI've seen a lot a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days look for the helpers\nYes\nAs part of that same special\n[noise] uh as part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence lets us and\nI've been terribly concerned about them graphic display of violence which the ... media has been showing recently\nAnd I played for your protection and the poor oh you're young children\nThere is just so much that a very young child can take with out of being overwhelming\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\n[noise] well I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from India where we can talk and share\nUm are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good national attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the final inside course undermines that message so looking for help help to see the good that is still around us for granted you said that we have one life to live on this earth and\nWe can spend that time encouraging people to demean the fly simply hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children ... and others ten years this life I'm In very meaningful and creative way\nWere British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that he would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn their feelings on normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express their anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people\nUm and I and I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and neighbor in the greater sense of the world and everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor\nUm and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds some all face symbolic races um said that we can live together on this earth and very productive ways\nWhat's this been like for you living right they're outside of Pittsburgh\nAnd it's [laughter] I'm like it very hard I think I'm meeting and talking with semester teachers um in early childhood programs might minor background to try this out in early childhood and so I've been talking to some of the teachers and the
