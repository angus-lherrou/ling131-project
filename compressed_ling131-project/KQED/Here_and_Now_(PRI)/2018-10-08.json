San Francisco's gubernatorial debate between Republican John Cox and Democrat Gavin Newsom\nI'd like to hear your thoughts about the debate or who you thought better presented himself and the reasons why that your analysis of it not necessarily just why you support one or the other candidate but what about this particular\nHead to head conversation affected you most and why eight six six\nEight nine three five seven to two that there are calling numbers state wide whether you were in the San Francisco bay area San Diego county Monterey Bay area or throughout the five county Southern California region eight six six eight nine three\nFive seven to two lead person to another uh selections from the debate this one about their different policies on gun control\nI certainly favor keeping guns out of the hands of people who are dangerous people who are mentally ill and uh but you know the second amendment is an important amendment\nLet's let's be honest with you with a John's record he said gun\nSafety laws are quote unquote a waste of time he prides himself in a lifetime member of the national Rifle Association doesn't believe in wait times ah and has been a strong advocate for concealed weapons concealed carry legislation\nOr in every one of these cases I think he's wrong and you're like John thankfully in in a position of real\nLeadership and influence in the state of California\nBecause we would not have had the progressive record on gun safety that we had that if they literally countless supplies\nIn this state I'm very proud of the fact that I took on the n._r._a. with proposition sixty three and we want and we're about to be the first state in America to require the same background checks we do on guns for all ammunition purchases that begins in January of next year it's an example of a start\nFor all ammunition purchases that begins in January of next year it's an example of a stark contrast between John and myself I Believe gun safety laws work my dad's Gavin Newsom John\n... prior to that they talked about their differing views on gun control Sarah in the mid Wilshire district of Los Angeles you wanted to talk about that well what did you think after hearing that exchange\nIt was also part of the exchange where led you\nTo John Cox about what he would do in terms of gun control he literally said I don't know and\nWell I Try not to go just to print party line I find it really just in tenth horrifying that somebody would have an answer I don't know and expect us to talk to them as opposed to getting a I'm a strong foundation about just exactly keep going down helping make sure that we don't get an end in the hands of\nPeople who uh who shouldn't have\nThem overall what was your sense of how directly the two candidates he answered the questions\nIt seems to me that new soon answered the questions endless was happy to ...\nIs is very specific or mark 'em and it talks basically and\nSarah I appreciate your being with us we're at eight six six eight nine three five seven to two which are state wide call in program following the only scheduled gubernatorial debate here in California I'm let's bring into our conversation Sean Walsh Republican political analyst he\nWas an advisor to California Governor Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger and also worked in the administrations of a president Ronald Reagan and President George H W. Bush Sean thank you for for being with us today a first of all your thoughts about the two candidates and in and\nHow they responded who did you think was more direct\nWell first I guess if you have to frame of the debate itself it's prime time somewhere in the world in London but certainly not prime time and California\nAnd so uh with regards to the candidates themselves um there was really up to John Cox to try and drop blood or drug contests a contrast if you look at the polling numbers and I just don't think he did it today it felt a little bit like Garrison Keillor you know the nice Midwestern\nOr immigrant to California a soft versus Gavin Newsom the slick politician\nAnd I think John could have taken the band was er Cox and drawn that contrast going after him on labor unions on the fact that the tax structure is really disastrous uh gone after months single payer and the you know trillion dollar cost them their pension problems but he really didn't\nHit him hard enough in where he is you know special interests bases and ah I'm not sure the advances cause a lot he didn't hurt himself but I don't think he did the contracts they need to do\nJohn Walsh Republican political analyst also with us Matt Rodriguez democratic strategist founder of or drink as strategies in Los Angeles he was a former senior Obama advisor in two thousand eight I met your sense of how the two are compared with each other\nYeah I it it was really kind of obvious right I thought I thought cautious and you you alluded to earlier I thought he was much better and I've heard him in the past him he had been really shaky are both in terms of California issues as well as just as presentation\nSo I think we're all gather was clearly more polished at an ad had twenty point proposals for everything that had come up I Do think Cox was much much better than I've heard him before we're cautious trying to do is really drive this you know question in this debate into a\nA sort of back and forth on what is California looked down and where is it going because for all the talk of our great California is doing there are a lot of issues out there there's everything and so some of them have gotten to debate somebody didn't pensions the cost of living income inequality housing homelessness or any sort of touched on some of those issues some of those they didn't\nUh but I think what he's trying to say is look for all of this one party rule it's in the state look at some of the huge problems that we have and there's a lot of people are struggling in this state once you get off the coast\nA new some did exactly what you'd expect him to do we spend a government a long time and so he was ready with with with twenty point answers for each sub subject came up I just don't think Cox did enough to really frame his sort of more mackerel case that I'm something new and we need something new\nThe bottom line is for as much as people are talking about great California's we have real issues that that only Democrats could have been responsible for 'cause they'd been in power for so long and so with unfettered power\nBut I don't think he was quite able to really do that so I thought he did fine the need is better than I heard it before but I just don't see where this move the needle for him and any significant\nWay once again we have our phone lines available for you to call in whether you join us from Southern California the San Francisco bay area\nA throughout the Monterey Bay area as well uh we're at eight six six eight nine three five seven to two so you can take part in

radio entities here in\nCalifornia housing reporter Matt live in math thank you for being with us a Saturn Scott Shafer the moderator came right out of the gay talking about California's housing shortage and the astronomically high housing prices hear your thoughts on how the two candidates differentiated themselves\nLook I don't think you heard any of the war adequate different from what either but it it said on HBO that has a say\nFor the heart I Need to reform the quality act that is I'm a I'm In a in some actually one thing that was way to do is a discussion\nIs a discussion of tax reform and they're like you mentioned about their teeth Scott is but it said oh you're talking about Thirteen\nUm which I think that got me a little bit as a pack but he was basically saying it to solve the housing crisis we're gonna have to tackle some elements a pack their team which is often considered the third way out in California politics\nAnd did you come away with the sense of uh where new some might be willing to go with daddy certainly left the door open\nFor a prop Thirteen reform\nYeah I think ... you know intentionally kind of vague on each is typically why what he plans to do with it you\nKnow he's never ever talked about what Pilates Thirteen eight\nUm he is trying to basically we can figure ... cities approach their decision to do\nTo save for vacant land um cities have anything to have like he mentioned to put a target on a piece of land instead of housing um you know it is not going to get into the details of what he's going to do um\nBut it would be interesting to see that that and not other elements that his has a plan what he actually stressed\nRight hand or when it comes to the California environmental quality act known as C ... um Gavin Newsom expressed a little bit of of openness there back up but how far as you said he's willing to go to reform sequel\nAnd by hub foundation presenting Chris Hedges Noam Chomsky and ... a vital speaking on U.S foreign

San Diego listening on NPR member station KCPW PBS I Know well with us from Oakland listening on ... you know well what stood out most for you\nFrankly I was very shocked by Cox's I'm discounting other prior statements on gay and trance folks and um the way he tried to somehow\nMake it equivalent to Obama and Clinton um evolving that kind of things that he ... the kind of words he was using I Would think qualify as hate speech\nAnd are not in line with California as the as far as I can tell and I I honestly he not a Californian and its comes loud and clear when you start making comments about transvestites in classrooms and\nOther forms of hate speech and trying to discount the statement and erase them away as somehow being involved um was really\nI don't know what the word is not cool not OK and he should not even be running all kinds of your points\nNow well thanks for your call in Oakland listening on ... I mean you got to talk with John Walsh Republican political analyst Sean uh did you think that Koch should have done more to um distance himself from his earlier statements are on these cultural issues\n[noise] well I don't know I mean what do you say about stuff like that and you know when Scott Shafer opened up the show or you know he talked about that issue it's very important for large segments of the California public uh\nVery important for large segments of the California public a particularly in San Francisco where cake UD hosted this issue this these issues matter matters in the East Bay matters in West Hollywood in LA so I think it was a legitimate issue to raise and I honestly what else do you say\nI'll take the man at face value that he has been educated as to um you know equal rights and human rights in this matter and he's accepting of\nA same sex adoption and same sex marriage so I take him to face value or he could have gone back in and probably rallied a little bit of the more conservative base by a quid vacating on that but he didn't so you know I think he did about as well as he could answering that question\nA ... democratic strategist what did you think of Cox's response on that question you\nKnow he really just wanted didn't want to answer I mean at the end of the day he's trying to make this race about the economy housing affordability and and kind of political reform ah so he was just trying to run away from that stuff is as quickly as he could in the modern era that's hard to do these things keep keep coming out\nTo the answer it while or not you know any anyone who's already uh uh upset about what he said that is likely not going to be moved by that I Do think this goes to show how ugly this race could have benefits were closer race cabinet is not really need to do engage hard he's not been spending a lot of money if they were really going back and forth you'd see quotes like that really led up\nAh I think tried to walk away with it out and walk away from it I don't think he did it took me a good job of an insurance wearing what are you going to say so I I think we're on what you do you try to just move on but he was not he was looking to stay as far away from that quote as he possibly could\nLet's talk about the ah statements the claims were made by the two candidates in last hours debate politifact California reporter for Capital Public radio Chris Nichols Chris you've been fact checking and dad what did you find that maybe doesn't pass the test of a U.S being factual\nWell good morning we we had been fact checking we um\nWe heard John Cox spend a lot of his time making claims about California's high taxes high cost of housing\nWe've done a number of fact checks on that past generally he's he's right on those one that that we're going to be looking into that it's a little bit questionable or or potentially misleading is a claim a he made about San Francisco having a highest property crime rate in the nation and then\nImmediately essentially connecting Gavin Newsom to that saying he\nHad been mayor there for eight years I mean that's correct but you have to of course remember that the last time\nKnew she was mayor or studying any policies in that city was back in January of two thousand eleven\nUm we are also looking at claims\nMade by new some where he essentially said that Cox says pirated from on immigration issues that again there's probably some truth there we did a recent fact check where we looked at the family separation issue when it comes to that ... says has essentially tried to\nUh put some distance between himself and Trump has said he did oppose strongly oppose that child separation policy so as with a lot of statements there's a bit of truth and then there are some misleading portions of it as well\nIs there any more that you're still in the process of researching a firm claims this morning well\nWill also be looking at a comment that I gather new some made a when he said that essentially John Cox said said gun safety laws are a waste of time or we would like to you know look at the facts on that one that's quite a remarkable statement I'm In we will probably be looking at some statements\nThat John Cox made when it comes to wildfires and the emissions that they cause he essentially made a comparison between wildfires producing\nMore pollutants than our cars do we've looked at that in the past that's only true if you consider one specific type of pollutants particulate matter cars on the other hand produce far more", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "08"}
