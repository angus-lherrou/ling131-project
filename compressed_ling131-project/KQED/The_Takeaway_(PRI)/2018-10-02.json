captains for migrant children this time around critics say it's a crisis of the government's own making joining me now to discuss this is Bob more an independent journalist based in El Paso who writes about the border for publications like Texas Monthly and the Washington Post\nHigh Bob Hi thanks for having me\nThanks for being with us and mark Greenberg the former head of the U.S department of

now has more than twelve thousand\nEight hundred kids in its custody that's five times as many as last year how did we get here\nOne topic a staff says is now well over thirty thousand according to numbers I got yesterday uh children have been crossing the border unaccompanied from Central America in large numbers sense around two thousand four key mark and talk about how the Obama administration dealt with it\nBut the Trump Administration has changed some policies\nYou have overall sort of this climate out there that makes immigrant families very unlikely to step forward and try to take sponsorship\nOf these children who arrive at the border on a company and then you had the implementation of very specific\nPolicies particularly a new requirement that any family that wants to sponsor one of these children who arrives at the border without a parent or guardian which is usually another family member must now submit their fingerprints to\nIce as well as the fingerprints of any adult in the household\nMost of these families of course have at least one undocumented member in the household and this is just had\nA massive chilling effect on the willingness of these families to take these children and so they're sitting in federal custody which increasingly means thousands of them are sitting in these temporary facilities in parents are either in the desert here in Texas or or out in homestead Florida\nMark I'm going to ask we're being told that this is the highest number of migrant children being held in detention ever a but in twenty four Tina's not mentioned in at that point you are with the Obama administration there were far more unaccompanied children crossing the border what's the difference between twenty fourteen and today\nSo first that's exactly right that this is the highest number ever in custody\nIt is not because this is the highest number of arrivals ever the number of arrivals is greater this year than it was last year but it's not nearly as high as it was in twenty fourteen or twenty sixteen the reason that a much larger number of children or her in\nMore on the search to uncover what really happened during the

really for the first time for a change for freedoms for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting and powerful kind of civic movement that really had no precedent in Mexico\nAnd that a movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall of the movement grew in strength and the demands became sharper and more articulate it\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students\nWith the terrible shootout and massacre that took place during the protests meet him in the public square at ... in Mexico city on October second when dozens of students and

just simply wasn't true it was a lie and what actually happened which we discovered slowly over the years that in fact the president had placed snipers in those buildings that overlooks the square

I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what's happened to the last year it's been almost a year since um the hobby might seem allegations came out\nTo have the last year it's been almost a year since um the hobby might seem allegations came out and there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of our society\nWe start talking about what consent looks like from cells in our daily lives in orange ... and then they thing\nWhat is consent how is it being defined today and has that definition evolved\nA word you can also that question I still do it is essentially an agreement between new many to people as to whether we move forward with sex or not\nBut it is incredibly difficult to define which is one of the things we found out in the peace and how you get to the point of consent is constantly up for debate one of the things that we're doing in this piece was affirmative consent you know needing to have a solid yes before you move forward with any kind of um sexual interaction\nAnd that on the face of it it's great because that would just spell any kind of confusion around this topic but when we actually think about it you know needing to you have a yes when you strict someone's\nHand when you kiss someone not always seen as very sexy thought maybe that's a problem with our society and a ... for sexy and very month is maybe we need to not redefining them\n[noise] and then the question becomes all part of the question in this film is what can be gained by talking to the people who have hurt you and I think that's a really delicate\nPlace to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nI think that it taught me depends on your situation how that trauma has manifested itself and how you feel about that particular scenario paying out\nWhat we tracked in this documentary is a case of two adults who ten years ago had sex one person ... consensual sex a drunken incident won't pass some cool about rape and they sat down and had a face to face conversation\nI told myself that was in training and that the things I thought I ... just take a real like boiling not not wanting to follow the final question\nTheir soccer I don't remember how it started in your room wired

we really don't have a lot of options for how to handle situations so often happens give the guy or even decades ago um I said this is one option to face it with conversation and dialogue\nIsn't there I mean I I Would also say it's a pretty dangerous way to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own called the person or I just\nKnow says something that ... up a lot of feeling yeah definitely and and as I said it's definitely not for everyone and wouldn't recommend to without seeking professional advice as to um [noise] yeah I mean there's a lot it's a very controversial technique it can cause ... station\nUm it can be seen as a too soft and approach but some people I mean some people do decide to go through the criminal justice system this is just an old tentative option that I wasn't aware of before making this documentary in that we wanted to bring to the table as a possibility for some people\nIs there any other way that people should be thinking about getting to that level of reconciliation without a face to face meeting and I think we often talk about forgiveness in a way that that's the end goal but is it\n[noise] no I mean and and they were sort of justice sessions I should say that the end goal is not necessarily forgiveness um the majority of justice sessions allow the survivors to be in the driver's seat\nAnd so it's up to them whether they forgave or not or whether they want more sessions or whether they want to continue the conversation or whether they want to just\nLet it go there obviously many different ways in which individuals find healing and find closure and this is definitely not a building and ... every one I Would say that they're all limited options because you know I feel the criminal justice system is\nOften fails us in when we want to handle these situations and six out of a thousand cases of sexual assault go without convictions and so we have very limited options but this is just one of the ones that we tried to showcase hair\nAnd at the beginning of the film you mentioned your own experience um that you said falls into the sort of gray area of consent did that experience make you change the way you think about trauma\nI think that it's an interesting time to talk about ... if the last few days have been if anything it's that trauma is real and lasting and can run extremely deep I've been surprised over the last year will say that that experience have had a lasting\nImpact and that I Do
