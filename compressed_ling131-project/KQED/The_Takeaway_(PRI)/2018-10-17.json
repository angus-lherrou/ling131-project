E. O. P. P. I. C. mark Bolger sorry who will be a seated between Senator Feinstein and Kevin do the on the state senator and guy this is a\nAlong the way to debate in fact you could say we'd been waiting Eighteen years since the last time I and Feinstein debated a a an opponent in a U.S Senate race was a two thousand against Tom Campbell the Republican that's right and we just talked about their voters eligible to\nVote this year for the first time that have never had Dianne Feinstein debate and a U.S Senate debate in their lifetime and it's odd that it's we're almost you know a little less than three weeks away from election day this feels like kind of the first\nConfrontation or first kind of event this entire US Senate campaign it's so rare to have a competitive Senate campaign we haven't had many California and the last couple of decades and this one has been kind of waged at a distance throughout you know throughout this whole summer\nAnd because of California's top two primary system we have two Democrats facing off a Dianne Feinstein of course has been there since she was elected in the year the woman in Nineteen Ninety to a senior Barbara Boxer was also elected she is now retired of course replaced by Kamala Harris\nA but this has been a a debate that Kevin deli own has been asking for for a long time and sort of like in the governor's race where we only had one debate kick you and he was the host of that one a week ago\nA Senator Feinstein has a ... at least I guess you could say use the excuse that she's been back in Washington doing the business of being a U.S senator but they did agree to this one event today and guy we as we were thinking about this broadcast wondering should we even call it a debate because it really it's more of a conversation like the governor's\nA conversation with John Cox and Gavin Newsom was last week that's right and\nCertainly not the kind of debate Kevin de Leon was probably hoping for in the U.S Senate race just seeing some of the early pictures of from the CPI sea event in San Francisco looks like a small room you know a few chairs set up with no debt water at the desk I think for someone like Kevin daily on who wants to display the kind of fire that it's made\nOur others US Senator ... Harris a you know a vastly rising in popularity this is a hard setting to do that you're in a closed space you're you're with\nA Dianne Feinstein you know sitting just across from you you don't want to seem like\nI'm being able to build homes for people\nOr that they can afford is important in all of this somehow some way always touches on government it does on the local level and it does on the national level\nSo I think being for those things that improve life for people in this great state and provide for their economic wellbeing\nAre those things that I Want to deal with and haven't been described that more as we go on\nThank you very much you Senator Feinstein the next question comes to you and then we'll go to a senator down eighty five percent of Californians in our most recent poll said that they were they supported hey I'm a path to\nLegal status for undocumented immigrants I'm going to ask you the same question which I asked um leader Pelosi and leader McCarthy when they were with us in a\nA couple of forums in August what steps would you take in the next Congress to move forward the proposals for immigration\nReform well first of all on the leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee that is the committee would handle immigration\nIf we are in the majority if the Democrats are in the majority there will be a comprehensive immigration reform plan before our committee we've been there before about five years ago with one it came out\nA after weeks and maybe a hundred amendments in committee which is unusual\nAnd he passed the Senate and was never taken up by the house there is a real need for a major immigration bill and I believe\nUh that if Democrats control the United States Senate you will see one come out of the committee and you will see one day passed out by the Senate\nThank you what would you do Well Mark\nThank you\nWhat would you do Well Mark let me see what I I just repeated a few moments ago is is is I Believe that our nation has turned its back on our family\nTheir immigrants um that we haven't betrayed American children um because we have a hunting down their mothers and fathers pursue them with our ice agents\nUm let me tell you the story about Roma level who's a constituent of mine is a hard working a loving father of two daughters ... Roma low a\nFirm highland park was stopped and apprehended I'm just one block before\nHe was dropping off his daughter and her ... middle school\nUm he was the humanized\nI'm uh right in front of his daughters and he was detained in jail um I and others intervene to secure his release but role models story is is not unique as we know that fits the story of of millions of of of\nFolks here in California and throughout the country but\nBecause of the lack of action\nIn Washington I've had to lead in California\nOr by moving forward and protecting a California family is from Donald Trump by moving\nForward century state measure which is now the law the land of the state of California even though we were sued by attorney general Jeff Sessions we had a Republican or judge you stayed very clearly it's constitutional it's a lot of land to California because of the inaction\nIn Washington I've had to lead to to provide tens of millions of dollars for legal resources\nFor our young dreamers who knows no other country about the United states of ... a night six America and no no other state than California um\nWe need to do something immediately on this issue um we have a White House that has politicize ice and his\nUse it as a weapon for their own electro a game or throughout the country and and and I think it is important to sort of\nContrast that ice was created through the homeland security act and the homeland security act are are senior center didn't vote for the homeland security act and therefore the creation of a vice agents that have lost their way instead of pursuing a terrorist as well as a criminal violent felons\nThey're pursuing mothers and fathers were ... were selling fruits\nOr on the street every single day and this is issue obviously that I take it personal my mother had the courage of her convictions or to cross the border into come to this country worker\nFingers to the bone and put a roof over my head if it wasn't for her and millions of others like her 'cause my story is not unique it's not original it's a story so many other hardworking immigrants in California but\nWe need to have action and Washington seeing that the cruel reality is there has been no action for decades Washington [noise]\nLet's move forward with another question I was sitting in an an a plus Angeles Times today that um it it's on the one year anniversary of the women who came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct in Sacramento that was that was an issue which um\nI Know that you um southwest has a a Senate pro tem yeah last year when we were on stage together last January um that that was a very um you know serious topic of discussion there\nSo I'd like to hear from ... year wedding sounds lessons that you've learned around um the sexual misconduct allegations that well inform you going forward and what are your thoughts about how they are what Santa crafts are saying about the fact that um if\nThey had to take control of Congress that uh that uh the allegations that were raised about Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be a should there but here in more detail for let me say this\nI don't believe that any woman should suffer from sexual harassment and certainly sexual assaults um especially when the only thing she's trying to do is do her job um\n[noise] I remember last year reading a letter that was signed by one hundred and forty women from the capital community and it was a letter that has a huge impact on me and I worked very closely with the female senators I'm from the California state Senate and together under our leadership or we move\nForward most comprehensive internal reforms in the history of the California state Senate or we actually now today a outsource any independent investigation to a legal law firm that's free of any political influence\nWe establish a one eight hundred hotline and we also created a climate survey and an anonymous climate surveys so all staff members could contribute their thoughts and feelings\nAre about this issue of sexual harassment and sexual solve I I think it's a model that we're very proud of and I think it's a model that I'd like to take the Washington DC I think that the U.S Congress had\nA letter signed by over one thousand women\nIn the U.S Congress and to date there's been no action by the members of the United States Congress and I think can either she'll\nActually got it writes in her op ed piece a few weeks ago in New York Times that when she was subjected to humiliation before the Congress than the ... the country when I'm a\nAnother a Supreme Court nominee was before the U.S Senate Judiciary committee um she'd wish that there was a of a process\nIn the Senate Judiciary committee as well as you've sent US Senate as a whole to deal with victims of sex\nA model but I'd like to take to Washington DC I think that the U.S Congress had a letter signed by over one thousand women\nIn the U.S Congress and today there's been no action by the members of the United States Congress and I think can either she'll\nActually got a writes in Rockford peace but a few weeks ago in New York Times that when she was subjected to humiliation before the Congress than the ... the country when I'm a\nA another a Supreme Court nominee was before the U.S Senate Judiciary committee should wish that there was a of a process in the Senate Judiciary committee as well as you've sent US Senate as a whole to deal with victims of sexual harassment and assault and those individuals will coming before\nThe U.S Senate Judiciary committee for confirmation that they had a process but no process existed I think we witness said during the hearings 'em and Thirty years after\nA Anita Hill there is so no process in the U.S Senate or overall the U.S Congress that's what I wanted to do I want to take that and I think it's a model that we can use because this was not a\nThis is a cultural issue into to suicidal issue that impacts all of our spaces and I think men in particular has to take a very strong role a leading role to deal with this issue first and foremost because of his men with the vast majority of the perpetrators of both sexual assault and harassment in in this country\nAnd what about revisiting the allegation against cap I Would say yes\nAh I fought very hard to make sure that Brett Kavanaugh was not confirmed a by the U.S Senate I made phone calls to a ... a in Alaska and let our phone bank operation in Los Angeles or so the answer is yes\nUnquestionably Senator Feinstein you've\nBeen in the middle of this issue for the last few weeks and uh\nGun laws and environmental policy\nAssert again environmental policy we could read it it could be either protection or climate change too fast differences\n\nWhat would you do to take action and those areas other than speak out against them or what you actually do to represent Californians in these areas where policy at the federal level it's going in a different direction yeah\nWell that that's why we have to export California values to Washington and not the other way round because oftentimes that's Washington speak at two we can do this\nOr we can do that or it's no no no and if we take no for an answer continuously than than we accept the attitude of defeat us some and we just throw our our hands up in the air and I think that's a Washington has become and that's why California continue to be the leader not just for the nation but for\nThe entire world on this issue climate change for example I Believe that it is every Charles God's given rights to breathe clean air into their lungs I represent an area that has six major\nFreeways are crisscrossing district like a hydra headed monster that chokes they air the oxygen out of young girls lungs I have a elementary schools and they have hold public buildings and Jason's\nTo freeways are and we have all this carbon dioxide greenhouse gas enough and other dirty ugly pollution that our children reasons were lungs their number one reason for absenteeism in our public school system in California\nIsn't due to asthma and currently in California we have seven\nOf the most top ten polluted cities in America several cities in the Los Angeles based scenario in Southern California and surely in Central Valley so what we did in California is we doubled down and all the naysayers said we couldn't do it but we took on the fossil\nFuel industry and other very powerful political interests and we called Bush the most far reaching comprehensive climate change policy in the history\nOf the United states of America One hundred percent clean energy is this is something that we can do because we can take these environmental challenges and convert them to real economic opportunities putting everyday folks to work so the politicians in Ohio\nIn West Virginia and Kentucky quite frankly they have failed their constituents knowing and understanding that cold right now is is decreasing dramatically the consumption both domestically as well as internationally\nBut have yet to use the courage of their convictions in Washington to position\nThe people that they supposedly care deeply about\nThe constituents of coal miner or whose father was a coal miner or his grandfather was a coal miner and his father was a coal miner to convert them to clean energy policies that will really grow this economy we need to work with a Republican colleagues in Texas and in Iowa and elsewhere and say we can actually grow the economy\nIf that means taking own glory red white and blue and put it in on top of the turbine or the solar rays to make a patriotic and so be it\nBut we can grow this economy reduce or greenhouse gas emissions give our ... our children a real opportunity to read clean air into their lungs and grow this economy and this was something that can be done but we cannot let the new series of Washington always say that it cannot be done\nSenator Feinstein I Do I have a chance either on to that question well absolutely\nUm I I'd like to hear your thoughts about you know on abortion cherries or ... minutes or environmental protection or all of the above\nOkay wait out where they're just kind of ... actually I think we're in agreement okay I did the assault weapons legislation that was a lot for ten years I was the author of it um\nBefore I went to the Senate there was a shooting in one on one California street and a large number of people I think everybody here probably knows that were killed and I thought well all the time has come to really take weapons of war off the street\nAnd we wrote the bell and it was a law the only way I can get it through Kevin with us on the set of ten years which we did and down the numbers began to drop over time\nAn unfortunate way or the bail 'em sunset uh we met her at least a second bailout was senator Murphy and we have I think\nOver forty cosponsors on it um improving it uh as as we could um that bill will go nowhere in a Republican dominated\nSenate and house and that's reason to change things so we can do something or to keep weapons of war off of our street I feel as absolutely passionately and\n... you know I never thought that we would see school shootings\nAnd since Sandy Hook there hadn't been over two hundred school shootings was on tone four hundred a children Rwandan orange or killed we have to stop this\nAnd so I Am very dedicated a to that cause um I I think um\n\nIt it's very hard and back there on issues like this it's different from California but I think we've done a bell or that's been introduced and I hope\nI think we've done a bill or that's been introduced and I hope we have a chance of moving it we won't unless it becomes a Democratic Senate and then if it does I think we can move 'em a ban on assault weapons and I think that would be a major step forward for this country\nThank you very hungry the chance to add anything if we want to know guns has been you know it was too I Would say that\nUm I I agree um we have to do something immediately because too many of our children are dying\nUm let me tell you very quickly about young troop uh ones which to view beautiful nine year old tiger all lived about a block and a half away from me she was playing rambunctious Lee and her mother's kitchen and a two gang members were outside and shot\nAt each other and um the the bull appears to the kitchen wall an either or in the temple and um they took her off life support about um a few days right before Christmas [noise] um\nThe stories about young trooper ... are not unique because it happened in California cities in a in the country every single day and we need to do something because the last time we had any meaningful action in Washington DC was\nTwenty five years ago um we lost a golden opportunity between two thousand nine\nAnd two thousand eleven when we had a Democratic president when we had a democratic controlled Congress we should have used that opportunity in ... we had to strike at that moment to read you this old weapons fan but we did it\nAnd as a result we in California at elite once again the entire nation on the issue of bullets Sunday you should go spends on the issue\nOf magazines I have a one hundred fifty thirty five twenty five bullets which are now illegal in the state of California Senator Feinstein we want to make a quick comment about a\nUS Senator their lands comment about we missed an opportunity about the missing opportunity a gun on guns yeah it was between two thousand I don't think we disagree on that I think we are in a line that I that we can move on if unless\nUnless you've got something else you'd like to say on that um many other topics\nBut one thing that I I Do that that surface early on was health health care and\nUh throughout the last session of Congress a lot of the Democratic activity was around repeal and replace a efforts by Republicans in Congress that may or may not come out again but since there's been you know a lot of discussion around universal health coverage Medicare for all\nI'm Single payer what are your views on um extending health coverage I'm a I'm a universal basis and uh how do we pay for it\nWell I Believe in universal healthcare question is how to get it whether we shift everything that to medical care\nUnder the federal government or we do it in steps and here's what I Believe I Believe there should be a public option and that the government should have an option that people can opt into if they want\nUm we've looked at the coverage figures in this state and I think there are two point seven million people who have no coverage about a million and a half or undocumented so no federal program can apply to them\nBut uh we can still uh take some good action that would give people more coverage\nAnd one of them is reducing the age uh for eligibility Medicare to fifty five allowing people to buy in another is allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs which would drive prices down\nHaving a public option of a plan put together by the government that people can voluntarily opt into because it was competitive\nAnd essentially a take steps like that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
