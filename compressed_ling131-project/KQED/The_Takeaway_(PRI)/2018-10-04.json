black working class rural Americans\nBecause a lot of these areas are poor they struggle with economic development opportunities a lot more than than urban areas but they also have healthcare challenges specifically\nAs we know minorities often have health care disparities from diabetes to sickle cell obesity but they don't necessarily have the access to health care that you would have\nSay in a city you can have dozens and dozens of churches for example but no hospitals for miles and miles and that's a real challenge for them and something something that has has not been addressed frankly by by the folks that that get elected in those parts of of the country a lot of times and in your\nPiece you went to Georgia to report this out why did you choose that state\nWhat's yours was really really important because in Georgia there is obviously a very high profile given a tornado contest where possibly be first African American woman could be elected governor in the country and that Stacey Abrams and Stacey Abrams actually started her campaign\nIn South Georgia where a lot of these black rural voters lists\nAnd the reason that that's important is because you know about a third of the rural folks in Georgia are people of color\nAnd so unlike other contest local contest for example that may be\nDilute the power of people of color frankly because of of racial gerrymandering you know in a statewide contest these are the voters that can really be key to to those kinds of victory and frankly you know what she has done go into a lot of these places that had been forgotten\nYou know by Democrats in recent cycles could make the difference in that in that contest and others in in the south where you have a large populations of black folks especially in rural counties\nAaron one thing that comes across in your piece is that the black rural populations that you spoke to felt disaffected by politics that seems to be shifting and I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about that well one thing that's important\nTo think about for these folks is\nBecause they felt like they they they were electing people who were forgetting about them kind of in between election times you know they they were they were\nVoting for people who then did not come back and give them like I said the economic development that they were looking for or the health care that they need and so they felt like\nAt least in these off presidential year elections that their vote didn't count you know you've got now\nFolks to look like they're running in more of these places are in in in several these counties that I went to you have incumbents who've been in office for years in some cases even white conservative lawmakers at the local level\nRepresenting majority black counties and and I wondered you know how that possible well these people have gone unchallenged\nFor so long or people you know have not paid attention to those local level elections and so these people have stayed in office but but now that starting to change if folks are starting to get more engaged in these local uh down ballot races and realizing that that they can also make a difference\nRight and and what's interesting also is that I interviewed therapists marsh is a journalist and a couple of weeks ago and she was talking about how white progressive rural voters\nFeel that their perspectives have been forgotten in the Trump country narrative freight did rural black voters also feel like they were being left out of the media narrative or was that just something that wasn't even a concern for them now I think it definitely\nIs a concern because you know I brought this up to them you know doing my reporting it now a lot of the nodded their heads in agreement I you know they're not front of mind when you think about rural voters or even farmers I mean black people there's never been a time in this country when black people have not been connected to the land\nAnd so the idea that somehow we have been distance from that narrative is is really interesting to me I mean I'm from the south and so obviously for me that's not something that's foreign but but for a lot of folks that that are in cities and maybe you know either don't have relatives are aren't getting back\nTo to that part of the country to see family or friends it\nDoesn't always occur to folks that yes there are black people living in rural areas in and quite a lot of them frankly\nI'm curious if you think there could be the potential for coalitions to be formed between say more progressive white rural voters and rural black voters who might be able to see some opportunities there for\nCross pollination if you will of ideas or is that just is it too early to tell right now ... you know I think\nIt's entirely possible and I say that because again when you're in a small place like that you know these are folks that are interacting\nSo much I mean not to suggest that there are still places like that where there there is segregation and people are living in different parts of town but the town is so much smaller than say a big city and so these are folks that really do\nKnow each other you know I I think of a recent campaign stop that Stacey Abrams head down and plains Georgia which is the hometown of former President Jimmy Carter\nAnd you know the idea that the two of them would be on the campaign trail together President Carter had endorsed her\nThey're talking about rural healthcare that's something that affects both those progressive white rural voters and black rural voters and so you know understanding that they do have shared interests I I think does prevent an opportunity for just that kind of coalition\nTalk about ... the Associated Press

a woman is a victim of domestic violence finding a way out\nIs not easy\nBut for immigrant women especially those who are undocumented things can be even more complicated in fact immigrant women are nearly twice as likely as the general population to experience to mystic violent\nThese women may not be aware of the legal options available to them or those options themselves may be limited many of them say they fear deportation if they contact\nOver the last several decades a secretive network of let the nuts her sprung up in California to help those suffering from domestic abuse women who had actually open\nSponsorship of particularly the live stream by Dan fridge master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature and political science and infection will be held on Monday October Fifteen yeah Mel a Dutch Shepherd ...\nOpinion chips and even medical and legal advice presser says there are about one hundred and fifty other let the women nationwide doing work similar to what she saw in California and she told me about one of the women she followed in her reporting\nSo I've all women in ... and she's opening her home in one of the women who who she's working with as a woman who I call Sylvia um she has been in an abusive relationship for many years and for a while\nShe was struggling to leave because she was nervous about going public with her story at all since Trump was elected she became much more nervous about the threat of deportation and in particular about losing her children and so\nShe came to Valentino house and stay for a week and now they're launching a sees her regularly to check in on her and she understands that this is a long process right now the average an average woman tries seven times to leave her\nAbusive partner in this country when you're an immigrant women that can be even more difficult what is a you visa\nAnd how does it play into this conversation I'll step back a little so the violence against women act as first passed in Nineteen Ninety four and it was the first federal legislative package that was designed to end violence against women and it included\nA piece of legislation that provided a path to permanent residency for\nAbused immigrant women who spouses were their abusers and who are also us at a center permanent residents so really small fraction immigrant women\nIn two thousand but the reauthorization of the violence against women act that was expanded and you'd be so it was created and offered a path to permanent residency for immigrant women who were victims of violent crime and who were willing to\nHelp with the investigation and prosecution of that crime was bipartisan legislation so that ... is that where does it stand today in the past four years we've seen an enormous backlog grow in tiny fourteen the government was granting use these as two women who had applied five months earlier if you apply today evil eight nine years for a visa\nThere isn't a hundred and twenty thousand person that clock so they're kept at ten thousand a year\nUm and the same timeframe you've seen the number of educators drop from Ninety three to sixty at the last official tally\nWhy is there such a delay and is that delay what spring these women in part to seek services quote unquote underground\nIt's hard to understand why there's such a delaying why there hasn't been a surplus or an addition of adjudicated top speed up the process\nIt's a good question about whether that delays driving people under God of course we don't know causation necessarily but definitely the woman who I was speaking to her opening their homes were finding that survivors who came to them just didn't want to wait nine years they couldn't wait nine years right\nSo that means that for nine years they don't have the protection of award private so they can't necessarily support their children and that's what the result is designed to do to to give people a pathway to residency so that they would be able to leave safely and to support their families\nAnd you know the Obama administration um how do you know had very controversial policies regarding immigration I'm Wondering are these would have been more concerned under today's circumstances under the Trump Administration or is there equal concern under the Obama administration is so what's the difference\nToday I was wondering the same thing and I was actually I'm somewhat surprised to learn that the concern is much much higher today than it was under Obama's administration the concern of ... and the concern of the concern of deportation a lot of the women who were\nComing to the safe holiday is essentially under the Obama administration\nDidn't feel as if it was as risky to come forward to the police they felt as if\nObama's deportation priorities were much clear and now those priorities have been widened so broadly that they really just don't know\nOne of the other things I heard a lot in this reporting was that women stopped particularly afraid about separation of families it's just all over the news in this way that they believe that it's possible that their family too can be separated\nWhen these women come to volunteer you know do they end up staying just temporarily do they end up going back to their abusive partners like what have you seen\nYeah so ... estimates that about half of the women who have stayed with her have gone back to their partners it's really really difficult police and half of last\nSome stay for a night some stay for two months so it really depends on the woman and Valentino is feeling is it's up to them and she'll do what what works best for them I mean I've met I met some women who opening their homes who found that the survivors stayed with them for as long as a year\nOne of the problems at the shelter system is that there's an expiration date I'm with you are if you are lucky enough to find a better than a shelter which is extremely hard to do\nYou often has sixty or Ninety Days maximum and then you have to get out and so these them and feel like the least they can do is kind of the extent that stay why does the network needs to be a secret\nSome of the women don't necessarily call it a secret and would actually speak about it publicly others feel as if it's too risky to say I'm bringing in women whose partners are\nAbusing them because they feel as if there's a possibility that it's easier will then come after them so many of them have kids that are living with you know and they're trying to protect their families and they're trying to protect their communities\nAnd in part it's because the survivors themselves want to disappear they feel as if if they can't get a restraining order I don't feel safe going to the police they can't get a restraining order they don't want to live in the same cities or their abusers they prefer to move to a different town and start a new life\nAnd so they would prefer if their location was secret and for the women who are opening their homes respected on it\nAct on it that is there anything we should be thinking about culturally because we're talking about Latinos in particular are there any uh cultural distinctions that come up and dealing with domestic violence\nThere's so much work that needs to be kind of a ground level just take out and then to ... comfortable talking among people who they know about what's going on in their home or what's going on in the workplace and we can't be family to see that can't be the same time\nWith the pressure is a
