Government uses troll farm to orchestrate digital attacks against dissidents and journalists including Christianity than Hubbard into Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting on these social media campaigns\nFrom farms are basically you know the best way to picture them would be like a call center like you would have you know to to field public relations were crusts or customer request something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations or the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this is for tax content that was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that is positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels of the Saudi Government well it would be pretty\nImpossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy is an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that ah say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government said we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of the suffered as somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman man who was you know the sort of the fact or ruler up the kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these trolls were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a ... that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that\nIt becomes in a way unreasonable they also try to game the algorithms to Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics so if there's hashtags picks up or there's some cases may have actually been create created by them\nThey can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that\nAnd don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know you just take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia\nAgain this is an authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers are government owned there's not a lot of public engagement or civil society and they're not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this is going to be this crazy technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really have the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they were able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just they don't know they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who's going to our trolls are called er sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on the social media to base of trying to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they say that apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trending lists on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective\nAnd um they they they end up playing a role social media plays a very large role in these countries and just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media doesn't any country\nBut the the differences Saudi Arabia is that they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they get on Twitter they can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them perceived their own their own government\nYou reported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person well\nWe know that there was the Saudi engineer or Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then to basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this person that he has been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using his access to the company and his his access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because I'm ... staff um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns was he ...\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed have this last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter he was very prolific on Twitter he would tweet in Arabic he would treat an English he would interact with people he would have post articles and\nYou also so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views\nBut you know somebody like to have that many followers just on his own Twitter account so\nThey put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments and lots and lots of abuse and and and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list the play where you know trying to influence the way that the content he was putting out as being received by people\nAnd we should also be clear that Twitter as a company has been under\nFire for a while now for what it allows and doesn't allow on his platform and how it controls when people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they are said anything about all this time folks from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or how\nA who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or to how their platform is being used in this instance I'm\nNot aware of any direct response for Twitter till the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about other ways that they tried to do this there was you know they put out information\nA few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of bought network I think they called it that they had taken down that was sort of a pro pro Saudi bought network that Twitter had taken down\nSo you know there there there are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when Twitter executive speak about this they say you know well we we want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking\nThings down and less otherwise necessary so I I mean I think for what are they they're trying to find a balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also stepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are enough areas\nThan Hubbard is the ... bureau chief for the New York times Ben thanks so much for your reporting on this so thank you [noise]\nDo you take away supported by as
