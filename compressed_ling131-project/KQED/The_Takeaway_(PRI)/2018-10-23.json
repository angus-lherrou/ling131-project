back in the studio with me\nThe latest investigation from the Trump team takes this deeper behind the scenes of the Trump Organization in a report that reveals a disturbing pattern of deception and fraud Andrea great to have you back on the show it is always great to be here\nSo one of the big questions we have is what is the Trump Organization is it a real estate company is it a construction company like why did they do\nSo the Trump Organization starts out building buildings which is what Donald Trump father Fred had done\nThen Donald Trump diversified and he goes into casinos a sort of number of developments and he runs into an awful lot of trouble with the banks because his project start failing banks don't want to lend to him so that starts this new thing\nAround the beginning of this century where he starts licensing his name and that's the way that the Trump Organization has always presented it we license our name we don't actually do the construction not what we found is that\nDonald Trump and his children even ... junior in particular would go around and they would imply to people that their family had\nEquity stakes ownership stake in projects and that the sales of these projects were going fantastically Ninety percent soul sold out these are the kinds of terms that were being used when in fact they didn't have an ownership stake they weren't\nSold out the way that they probably just restructure it was it they would get their fees no matter what so they would get paid the project would frequently fail\nAnd people who had invested in them bought in would lose their money\nAnd the trumps would move onto another project\nAnd say the same thing we had begun to see this in various projects but what we didn't realize was how consistent was the fact that it's a pattern was what was alarming to us because it suggests\nThat it is a business model it's not just a fluke is not just a project or a couple of projects combat\nAnd there's a about a dozen deals that you guys focus on in this episode and in particular there's one on the Trump ocean club in Panama City sounds a little bit about why that's so important\nSo the deal caught our attention for a few reasons one is that Panama is a place in the world that has a low rating on scales of corruption meaning that it is very corrupt at the time the Trump Organization got in Transparency International\nRated it worse for example than Saudi Arabia\nVery low worse than India so this is a country that is also known for being a place where various narco traffickers want to run their money money laundering and want to run their money because there's all of this banking secrecy in Panama this is a project that went bankrupt\nAnd we have we serve on earth through this extraordinary process our colleagues at ProPublica on earth the audio tape up even trumped in an interview she did in two thousand and eight where she was asked about this project\nProjects or at least for now it's filled with salt over Ninety percent of it and we saw that five hundred percent premium marketed ever prior to our entry\nNone of those things were true and although the interview was published the audio has never been heard before and you can hear how this mechanism works and it's okay to say I'm going to build the world's best building I'm going to build\nA such a beautiful building everybody's going to want to buy and there's actually a concept of legal concepts ... free which is fine you can say that it's when you start to make\nSpecific material representations ends you do it repeatedly that it becomes a question of whether there was actually a criminal fraud committed here now having said that a lot of the stuff happened a long time ago very far away so there are all kinds of\nQuestions have jurisdiction there are questions of statute of limitation but I think what this deep dive has done is really\nSort of make it clear to us that these are not fluke situations but they're actually a feature of the Trump business model and they sort of really changed the way that we view this licensing model which seemed like a really great idea of no banks lend lend you you just sell your name you don't have to worry about getting the financing\nBut that is in fact what happened in fact what happened is they got people specifically to buy in based on lies and miss representations early on what\nIs the Trump Organization up to now and it's funny that you mentioned the name and just over the weekend there were some New Yorkers who pulled the a lot of money together to get the name off of their building an understanding\nThat they do they took they took a like a cherry pick her up and took off the letters of this building which is something that's happened since Trump's than president there are still Trump projects around the world that they are actively working on their working in projects in the Dominican Republic they're working in projects in India\nThey're working in projects in Indonesia both Trump sons are now on on the campaign trail campaigning for the causes and candidates of their father\nCampaigning for the causes and candidates have their father but at the same time they're also going around the world\nSelling condos to potential investors that we don't know who they are also the president hasn't fully divested from his businesses he has not there was even one point in twenty Seventeen when Eric Trump admitted to Forbes magazine they actually we're still talking about it\nOfficially he's given up the day to day control but he can still make money from it\nAnd that is the thing that ethics experts say is so confusing you never know in any given situation whether he is making a decision as\nThe head of the Trump Organization because he could have some personal profit or if he's doing it\nBecause he's the president of the United states\nShouldn't that be I don't know illegal\n[laughter] I think to some extent what has happened with Donald Trump and it's it's sort of like broken the ethics systems for example the situation has just come up with a guide to Saudi Arabia\nBecause he's done business with the Saudis and he took this initially sort of muted position on what looked like the murder of an American journalist resident in Turkey and people were like well why is he doing that is it because of his business ties\nAnd the fundamental instability of this situation is that it's impossible to know\nNow you also want to send out a little message to your listeners on the podcast go for it\nRight

on pregnancy and childbirth or other related medical conditions but forty years later how well is the pregnancy discrimination act protecting the modern workforce\nDeborah dinner is an associate law professor at Emory University and she joins me now Debra thanks for being with us\nHello thanks for having me so tell us how is this law meant to protect pregnant women [noise]\nWell what the pregnancy discrimination ACT UP Nineteen Seventy eight does and I'll call it the PTA is it a men's title seven of the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four and title seven is a law\nThat prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex as well as race color religion and national origin\nAnd what the PTA does is it the fines sex discrimination to include pregnancy and discrimination on the basis of related medical conditions including childbirth\nSo what are some of the limitations to this law I understand it's a conditional lock and you tell us what that means\nSo what's the pregnancy discrimination act does if it says that you can't refuse to hire someone just\nBecause she's pregnant or you can't deny a promotion to pregnant women because you have stereotypes about mother had\nAnd it requires that pregnant persons persons affected by childbirth be treated just the same as other persons who are similar in quote their ability or inability to work\nIt's a requirement effectively at the same treatment so the biggest limitation of the PTA is that it's only an anti discrimination mandate\nAnd it leaves many workers bereft of protection and so what it doesn't require it doesn't guarantee enough ferment of entitlement turned accommodation in the workplace so let's imagine a managerial\nProfessional in a fortune five hundred company whose fortunate enough I'm lucky enough to work in a workplace that gives\nGenerous paid leave so if she broke her legs she could get say four weeks of paid leave similarly if she became pregnant and ... needed leave before childbirth or after childbirth she could get four weeks of paid childbirth because she would be treated the same\nBut let's imagine people who work in warehouses like in the recent New York times article\nThey work in low income jobs um where they are much less likely to have generalized protections for disability so they're damned player gets no for example no light duty accommodations to any worker when they fall L and that workplace and anti discrimination mandate does not get you very far\nSo just the requirement under the PTA that pregnant workers be treated the same as other temporarily disabled workers doesn't get that much protection said they won't be given light duty which poses a risk to their health and the health of their fetuses\nNow I Wonder if does have anything to do with the fact that pregnancy is considered a disability laws in this law because it feels like we're we're treating pregnancy the same as we would a quote unquote disability is not as a separate category is\nThat right [noise] yeah the law it's important to recognize that's not actually mention the word disability what the law says\nIs that sex discrimination under title seven includes pregnancy and then it gives you an example and it says that for example pregnant women should get the same benefits as other employees who are similar\nIn their ability or inability to work\nSo it might be helpful to explain a little bit where this idea of temporary disability came from feminists lawyers in the seventies where really worried that any law that specially protected pregnant women would lead\nTo hiring discrimination and so they promote it kind of approach that which sex neutral that analogy eyes between pregnancy and temporary disability in order to use anti discrimination\nAs a kind of bootstrap to get pregnant women some of the benefits that were available for temporarily disabled workers generally\nYoungest the UPS the Supreme Court expanded what would count as disparate treatment on the basis of pregnancy or what what count as kind of a differential treatment of pregnancy that was on last fall\nSo if an employer for example against accommodations to a large percentage of its workforce for whatever reason but not to pregnant workers that now can be considered unlawful another advance in a law we've seen is that stereotyping pregnant women\nIs itself in a way that leads to kind of an adverse employment action firing our\nFailure to promote or than Alex benefits that those kinds of gender stereotypes either themselves unlawful what what what gender stereotypes are you referring to well for example I think that one of the calls and the woman from New Jersey who\nI was told by her supervisor that she needed to take more time off work or have a kind of less demanding job because she should spend more time with the baby\nThose are the kinds of gender stereotypes that are actually I'm Still very prevalent the notion that a new mother won't be able to be as committed to the workforce because she's now committed\nTo her child more than she has her job those are the kinds of gender stereotypes that could be president of unlawful sex discrimination I got the PTA\nDeborah dinner is associate law professor at Emory University and she has a book coming out called the sex equality dilemma\nWork family and legal change it Neal liberal America there but thanks
