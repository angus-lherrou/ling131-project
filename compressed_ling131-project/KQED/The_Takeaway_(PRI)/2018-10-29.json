states history at times of great position is polarization alienation we have seen an uprise repeatedly in this kind of violence before and after the civil war\nIn the late Nineteen century during the

terrorism hate crimes\nReston sit along the fault lines of our society what we're seeing right now you're quite right is far more acute now that it's being in our modern memory but don't forget one Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorist bombings in the United states\nSo this is or not this is in terms of the violence

reacting to these uh recent events\n[noise] well I think that most of us view this as a resurgence of violence that has been a constant in this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical you try to lump lights the premises violence and with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacist terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has been you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing ham because a number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents who were trying to vote part of the problem of lumping white supremacist terrorism and with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacist terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream stake in the politics\nA lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacist terrorists are not far removed from the views that are being espoused by the geo Pete and particularly by Trump\nYou don't see as much pushback in terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as as an Amazon terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for

GBH radio in Boston [noise]\nPut American voters head to the polls next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle the winners of the midterms have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map it happens every ten years\nAnd it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level here to explain more is Denise Ross barber she's the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to the takeaway\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after the twenty\nTwenty census is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and re draw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\n... where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or new congressional district needs to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district in that may have to get rearranged into two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district\nI mean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can't just keep adding to the number of congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust alliance get drawn with regards to who's in what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change and what kind of a role\nIs redistricting playing in our upcoming midterm elections\nIn the vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that currently twenty nine governors and more than eight hundred state legislators who are in this year's\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new maps\nShow it's a fairly important process that takes place every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team because they won't be up and twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting pens\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors what are you seeing as far as money concern\nIn addition to the fact that the U.S house is at play in terms of slipping from Republican to Democrat\nThis is a very serious and major election at the state level because most states hold their big races during the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to Gallup PTA there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip\nBased on the upcoming election so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee which is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat\nUm and his group to NPR see has given directly to state candidates and political parties almost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the Pennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gave fifty thousand dollars and supportive of Ohio redistricting\nMeasure and this is just money that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have data on how much money these entities and others are spending independently on state races\nI mean you said it's hard to tell how much money they're spending independently are we able to find out who's funding efforts in state and local races\nCertainly the ... were able to know who is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective was that for them in terms of redistricting well I mean they obviously\nTook clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers were most vulnerable and which seats within those chambers were most\nVulnerable and really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country or in at least a vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also swung Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting not at all\nSponsorship as a cake you eighty

their year and they're worried more about their health insurance and whether or not they have a job and you know who draws a redistricting boundaries this kind of politically ... [laughter]\nThe whole process involves just a lot of ... and it's really\nA game that played primarily by the insiders of the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are\nPaying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the anti RC are very aware of it\nDenise Ross barber is managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise thanks for being with us thank you very much and\n[noise] [noise]\nThey take away is supported by huge originals on roadside attraction presenting diaper cloud starring Susan around in as a mother struggling to free her captured journalist son also starting math Omer and eating out though in theaters friday\nAnd babble European made language learning program babbled teachers practically conversation into your Russian Swedish and other languages available maps or or online or a B B.
