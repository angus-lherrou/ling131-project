when many people took to the streets to protest the bt government\nAt first it was a left wing protesters we tended to have here in Brazil and then in the meantime or after the first one the second one that when it got bigger and bigger it\nIt was a simulated as a a right wing movement\nAnd then from then on the started organizing themselves or they went to the streets are against it again in

a sudden character because well I don't believe that we have a fifty percent of the population dental father writes sauce I mean it just to be ten percent thoughts\nEvery last election and less Thirty

Brazil and also what's happening across the world\nYeah definitely it's a great\nReason for concern in well perhaps we are now in the frontline of something a lot bigger\nI'd like to consider it a backlash of many other advances we've had in this last decade in Brazil that seems to be the case at least\nBecause there was this a progressive governments for ... years and then you have this reaction that very conservative and besides the reactionary\nIn Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have been\nIn the United states it's been only Thirty years of democracy at this

equally\nEverybody\nNeeds Thomas I never see you again\nWhat that's just the off the gums as a matter of fact that's about the dumbest thing I ever heard of [noise] they don't want me to you because of something that happened two hundred years ago\nThat's the film's protagonist Peter who returns home to fight for his land in Louisiana as he tries to court his love interest Maria when I sat down with Sasha he told me why the films still resonates with viewers in twenty Eighteen\nLand ownership is an important part of the story and there was a statistic that someone in the film said that like every week black folks are losing a thousand acres of land and\nBy the year X Y Z black people won't have anything and I thought that was a really powerful idea this sense this idea of ownership and land ownership and the relationship that cultures have to the land in as people who have who are of African native dissent\nHaving this relationship and report the land and this ownership of the land in this you know sort of European system of\nWhat it means to own land well we're here so if we're going to participate we might as well be owners as well that was an important sort of subplot in the story that when you mix that in with feminism color resume class\nThere's a lot there\nDid you learn anything about your dad that you didn't know it didn't have a sense of through this film\nWell you know my parents split when I was young and\nHe moved on to another relationship the the woman that he was in a relationship with before he died\nShe's from the region and she worked on the film and had a hand in sort of clawing him into the world and why it's interesting and important but inside of the romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents\nYou know what that courtship might've been like because it was just something very I don't want to see simple but something so tender about the way the characters interact that it's it's very genuine that you can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny\nYou know I mean someone said recently who saw the film that it it has a very eighties vibe what does that mean well I was a kid in the eighties so what does that well you'll if you're a kid from the eighties you will love the\nParents of designer jeans everyone's ... rocket designer jeans everyone's but male and female looks great there's a photo Matt you know I don't know for those who are old enough\nTo ... days we used to have to take film right actually get a developed right out of little hut\nThat was usually stationed in a parking lot there was a photo Matt you know so the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really swelled the pacing everything so quick now but I think the pacing of the film is\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling the story of how my father would make everyone listened to the soundtrack and he made me listen to it too that's the one thing that I always remembered\nBut in some instances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way was kind of ahead of time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely the way it is\nDo you think that when you look at black film today in twenty eight teams\nDo you think that there is enough nuance uh black everyday life in those films similar to the way that your dad was able to bring that life is I think that is one of the most compelling things that you're talking about is just how nuanced and how delicate these portrayals word do you see the filmmakers are getting better at that well I think\nThese portrayals word do you see the filmmakers are getting better at that\nWell I think Hollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to beat and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes why marketing money\nOkay this very specific group of black people like these hair care products that you can sell stuff to people I get it but I think this sort of box that that same litter you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small it doesn't fit anymore and um\nYou look at you know my man childish can be no you know you look at this sort of new wave of okay here are some other black people to who have stories to tell who are great and so I have hope that things are changing but you know change never comes as quickly as you'd like\nYou're also a filmmaker are there any projects um that you're working on coming out\nWorking on a four part film about the Wu Tang clan there twenty fifth anniversary this year and um to really understand Wu Tang clan I mean you can listen to their music and enjoyed it sounds great but like to really peel back the lyrics is to have a real understanding of\nWho they are and where they come from and as I tell people all the time to understand hip hop or blues jazz you know all these art forms or reflection of in a reaction to the environment and so to tell the story you got to understand the environment all the things that they went through to become who they are and so\nTo me the music is the cherry on top it's all the other stuff the environment the social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling\nIs there anything that you're taking away from your dad's filmmaking process and incorporating it into the work that you do\nWell saying something every time I have the opportunity to make a film I say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop\nFashion and you you learn about a Sunday Best and most people you say Sunday Best and they think it means we're a nice suit but they don't realize it means in certain states it was mandated by their slaves and nice outfit so they can go to church and worship God that's white\nOr supposedly white there aren't a lot of people looked like me who have the opportunity to say things and so I like to entertain people but I think it's also important to say something so every film I Do and my father would definitely feel very strongly about that [noise]\nSasha Jenkins is a writer and
