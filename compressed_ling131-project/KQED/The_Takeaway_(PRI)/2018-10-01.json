for the first time\nShe told the magazine that Fernando raped and assaulted her in a hotel in Las Vegas in two thousand nine at the time she said she went to the police and even got examined by medical professionals ultimately she agreed to an out of court settlement for three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nBut now she's coming forward with her full story and she has the lawsuit documents to prove it some of which are assigned ... himself\nFor NATO denies the allegations and it's called the story quote unquote fake news his lawyers have said that they will sue the magazine joining me now to discuss\nDo the magazine joining me now to discuss this issue arena Ahmed freelance sports writer and co host of the burning all down podcast Shereen thanks for being with us\nHigh thanks you for having me something that we need some of your guidance on this story here so let's go for the basics of this who is the woman in question Katherine my your gut and how did she and wrote Ronaldo first meet\nWell Kevin or does actually from Las Vegas Nevada at the time she was twenty five and we're talking about this occurred in two thousand nine she was working at a night club\nAnd she was an aspiring models slash actress and she was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which is a policy I guess you can see his entourage\nSo he according to deter Spiegel article and her her account she noticed her pulled her aside\nAnd she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't sure and then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warnings for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has the story that he's a documented a sane\nChristie honoring all to himself in a conversation with his lawyer has actually said that she said no several times she said stop so this is part of what happened and he confirmed that in his own words so I mean afterwards she was in shock as most survivors are\nShe didn't know what to do and she was very intimidated by him and ... and then when she confided in somebody finally who advised her to go to the hospital and filed the police report\nYou know everybody's reaction was saying oh what's but he's so big he's so powerful and you'll get lost in this so coupled with her own trauma and the mounting fear of who he was because this isn't some too but player in a semi pro league this is arguably one of the best players and aspiring at that time\nSo it was you know it's pretty pretty mortified and she knew and what should be up against it didn't help that her first lawyer was not\nAs experienced and couldn't guide right away that needed to be but I mean she was not buying actress she didn't have twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with a system\nShore and this is this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where has the U.S media been on this story it this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nUm and I will say this very honestly as because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this white culture because\nThis is first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five\nBarely won anywhere it made no waves I think I just found a blurb on the guardian about it when I started this research myself and one of my co host friend also had been talking about this for a long time we want to do examining we pitched this story about sixteen different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know\nThe reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that Christian or an all do have an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representative you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nAnd that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not um as popular here I Would argue as maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think is is applicable here as well\nAbsolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlet [laughter] and no one wanted to ... nobody wanted to store and I'm like how can this not be possible that this is the first time this happened to the same thing with David ... the a\nCritical keeper for Manchester United was also just before the euro's implicated in a very brutal rape case a sexual assault of two workers sex workers\nBut also we we should also be clear though that that he that that ... has responded and denying these allegations right\nWell of course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid Catherine my work out three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars in NDA like let's not forget that that happened and she has the documentation I mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that\nYour speakers would not and this is something we have to address when we talk about media would not have printed that saves da da da and cross cities in legal has gone over a hundred times if Christie honor and all those teams going to sue ... because that would have done a year and a half ago to have an even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nRight and it and it also it was interesting to me that we are in this moment this me to moment\nA particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry a is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a real lack of attention to this given for example the Larry Nassar are stories that have come out in the sports world and other issues I'm I'm really surprised that the lack of attention from the American media here\nI'm not it was the same thing with David to hand look what happened with Kobe Bryant he was given basic you know a pass by the media which was complicit in this I'm not surprised at all but I'm happy to see that her stories being shared now\nSyrian Ahmed is a freelance sports writer and co host of the burned it all down

starting today's sixteen year old and New York state will no longer automatically be charged as adults in criminal courts thanks to the so called raise the age legislation passed last year as a result sixteen and Seventeen year old being detained at New York city's notorious Rikers Island jail\nTo be moved out by two day New York in North Carolina where the last two states in the nation to make this change here to bring us up to speed on these two huge changes to New York criminal justice system is our dear friend\nCindy Rodriguez then he covers urban affairs here at our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before Cindy thanks for being with us high tens ... Devi here so what exactly are the changes going into effect\nToday one is regarding housing and the other one is how the sixteen year olds are being charged\nRight right that's correct so said this law will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds and that they're facing it in so this is the start of the loss of this is the first phase of the law so if you're arrested\nAnd you're sixteen years old today um and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court if it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been a special youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm is the case involves sexual assaults if it involves any serious physical injury if it involves a weapon um it will stay in this youth part an adult criminal court\nOtherwise it will go to family court unless a prosecutor claims there's extraordinary circumstances and the judge agrees with that and then the case will stay\nAnd what about this move that the sixteen and Seventeen year olds do have to be moved out of Rikers Island which we know has been the center of so much controversy around or just how people have been treated at\nThe at the facility et cetera so it was today the day and what's happening yes that's true too so another thing to mention is that this law has not retroactive so that means if you're already serving in prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and Rikers Island and just to give a freer national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country\nUm it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you are there and that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything\nUm your case will continue through the adult criminal justice system but you will be moved off the island and in fact as of yesterday I was told that all Ninety three sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nThat were on Rikers Island are now out of there now let's talk about where they're going to go so they're going to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx\nAnd so they've all been moved there\nNow why this push for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this uh this change\nSo there's there's been said the laws years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in twenty fourteen when federal prosecutors started investigating how sixteen and Seventeen year olds were being treated\n'em an Rikers Island and they found that guards were using\nExcessive force on them they were striking them in the had repeatedly they were over using solitary confinement\nUm and so that was part of the effort to get them off of Rikers Island I'm In addition to that we have this young man named college sprout or who was in ... he was arrested for stealing a backpack\nUm that case was ultimately dismissed but he stayed there for three years he was in solitary confinement he was attacked by other inmates and by correction officers and he was very traumatized by that experience um he was out on sheet his family couldn't meet that three thousand dollars bell\nSo when he came out um his story was told by this journalist Jennifer ... from the New Yorker I got a lot of attention\nUm then he started suffering a lot with mental health issues and ultimately he killed himself so all of that is what is the backdrop of where we are today\nAnd there's been um lots of talk it particularly from uh New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan to essentially shutdown Rikers Island um and it's complex by twenty twenty seven twenty twenty seven\nI'm of course where all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly\nHow does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it's it's in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop it to about five thousand\nSo um [noise] this is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mention that to move people off the jails is to close down records I was going to be controversial said the plan is that\nThe city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up new jails in Burroughs um some of these would be ... that are more integrated into the community um to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process\nAnd there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are slated for and there's been tremendous opposition so far\nWhat about you mentioned clique prouder and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people in and out [noise]\nUm right so there is a whole debates about an effort to change\nA whole debates about an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which\nUm seems like it won't happen there is no something pretty interesting that's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis massive bailout that's being planned by the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and said that um mass bailout is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nAnd women who are incarcerated um there's about five that's about five hundred people um they were trying to raise five million dollars and the bailouts are supposed to happen\nThrough out the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see some of these people being built out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting the city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids every part\nOf the planning process has been guided by this puzzle city Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Cindy thank you tend to you know [noise]\nThat comment for this show up on our
