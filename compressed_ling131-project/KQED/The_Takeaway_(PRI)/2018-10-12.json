C. L. U. on the campus of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks California\nLater in the hour a primatologist takes us into the world to South America squirrel monkeys and what they teach us about our own evolution but first the Maya invented a sophisticated mathematics system that included the number zero zero how to be invented\nThey use this in their calendars and astronomical studies they also had farming systems in a complex political structure to govern the sprawling city networks\nHe was a complicated place and the full story is getting even more complex last month scientists survey data mining mega city in Guatemala\nThat I had over sixty thousand structures and this week researchers say that the money I may have also had a salt industry on the coast of president they believed\nThese results were published in the proceedings of the national academies of science here to tell us about the ... economy is Heather ... she's an author on that study and professor of anthropology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge welcome to science friday\nThank you it's a great pleasure to be here\nIt's aren't great pleasure to have you thank you you can make salt in a variety of ways so what technique do the Mayans where were they were they using to make salt [noise]\nWell I like people around the world of course everybody need dietary salt in ancient civilizations and other farming cultures as as well but uh the my uh collected salt from salt flats off the north coast of the Yucatan but in in other areas like the coast\nOf belief where it rains a lot and you you they don't have the solar vat of operation possibilities they were boiling frying in pots over fires and they\nWe found a inside their beliefs are below the sea floor we found wouldn't buildings which indicate they were doing that a ... production indoors on a massive scale\nWhat what was this surprising you know an expected [noise]\nUh yes it was I was really doing a reached a survey looking towards site or after having worked at elsewhere on the coast and I was looking in shallow areas\nBecause in the water because I knew but we did that if I feel of a ride and we found site said or about a meter below the sea floor and we excavated them and they had pottery that identified as salt making pottery\nThat's been published a book on on the fine salt like all of the ancient Maya but\nIn two thousand and four we made a major discovery and that was that below the sea floor it's mangroves Pete and the Pete which has resulted from the feel of a rise a\nIt preserved within posts and now we've mapped over four thousand with a map four thousand I'm forty two wouldn't post and other architectural elements\n[noise]\nFresh air coming after one o'clock\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in May of Nineteen fifty nine a small squirrel monkey from the jungles of Peru sat atop an American Jupiter rocket waiting her blast off into space\nMiss Baker was her name and after nine minutes of weightlessness she fell back to earth where she became an instant celebrity inundated with Leathers letters from school children and even in mobbed at a press conference was\nOne of the first two American Animals successfully launched into and returned from space mission bakers flight was a study and how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth\nAnalyzing their communications the structures of their societies and their brainy ways that they navigate their world as my next guest says Anita stone and assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks\nWelcome to science friday thank you it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood as one of the first animals that went into space wow what got you fascinated with study\nThough I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research and I started reading about squirrel monkey\nAnd became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazonian Brazil for twelve months and I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise]\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [laughter] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow ... show how many do you study how many you their group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly and I do do that\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the patron or freedom theater at the gym at ... dot com\nMax so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise] okay so we're monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree\nAnd uh they spent a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nUh they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of school monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their prayer or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYet so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd out with a head up and then they bite off the head kind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter]\nAnd I understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a Washington is wait why or why haven't they do that\nYeah so I've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low\nAnd once the adult lost desert the ness the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] it was once we're not leaving cellphone right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here lots\nOf of of of the other one of the spider markets let's let's hear that clip\n[noise] I\n... I should spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I didn't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver yeah um but when there's you know ten of them in a treats kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nMhm we have another clip that sounds a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm\n[noise]\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there's an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's the sound that we hear is that right is that this usually this is those are square monkeys and we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because we're monkeys sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of swear monkeys instead of bird and\nHow hard was it how much time as are taking you to know the difference in the study the sounds they make\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant\nHe's the monkey was for her and she knows everything about square monkeys and so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nHow long have you been doing that for a little longer he started with with\nHe can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nHow long have you been doing that for a little longer\nShe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well do you call him the yes sometimes he does me like it he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language or evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nYeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in social groups that we're increasingly large and so manual grooming sort of the the kind we seen bad dunes andme attacks\nBecame less less feasible really and so the ideas that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact and social bonds with their their friends\nUm and that would leave the hands also free for other tasks\nUm and the idea that that eventually would have evolved into human language now square monkeys for living in groups or poop so large they're actually\nYou can hear the PBS NewsHour this afternoon at three here on cake Huey public radio [noise]\n\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year salmon and go on the most important journey of their lives after living years in the wild wild oceans they must\nSponsorship of ... the live stream bike has a gym presenting this dog on a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth at the gym or freedom theater at the gym at that dot com\nYou arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like any good trip you need a map and not just the composition showing you where north dues you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to use it straight nor do more north east\nEast than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\n... what did they have long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of beer beer map is there Meg matter and what about there in Lansing dwelling cousins and when your lips fish living quiet landlocked lines you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nYou explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me you know I just I just said about but sandman live impressive lions right they travel all the way how many miles do their journeys type\nThat is pretty impressive and their journeys can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\nAnd and they usually actually these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct [laughter] and they don't just have to navigate upstream may have\nTo find the right stream to go how does he do there's been a day don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS\nOf some sort and [noise] you know this\nAh same and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally would use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and then the term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon being laughed exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake in\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish has never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\n... and ... and yet you found that they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these in why\nThat's an interesting question a so CNN when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different\nComponents one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as my field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAnother aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict are favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\n[noise] do they have little magnets in their bodies that can do that\nSo they're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear\nBut it's one of the leading hypotheses is that a salmon\nAnd other species\nHave tiny chains of magma tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property ... and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nThough these structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm now why why is it important to your wives and why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of feces that could go to the ocean\nRetain a map sense just to point out of curiosity\nAnd we also wanted to know um if it land examine\nAlso possess disability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse and not know amounts of these days but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort\nOf magnetic environments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo\nThe aid from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ battery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested and so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil\nAnd essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us\nTo alter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know from my basic physics you know one grade schools have if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnetized the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them setting their magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf there were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of night on tight right that right somehow connect within herself\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\n\nSo we evaluate the movement fishing event by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above this testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos\nOf our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale the night ...\n... so what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nThat we have a whole number of ... of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look at ... magnetic resolution of this map so having a theory that points moving them closer and closer together and to see how finer core scale their responses actually are\nMhm so uh could you save endangered sermon man by knowing some more about them\nI mean it always helps to know more information about us bases that you're trying to conserve knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and probably a tool\nIn Santa conservation but certainly not the only thing that we can do I think for them yeah well good luck to you and your future experiments All right thank you very much\nMichelle
