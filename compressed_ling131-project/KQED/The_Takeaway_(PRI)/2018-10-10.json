public schools should be reflection of our thinking\nThat's Carolyn Johnson and she worked for nearly four decades since a fourth grade teacher and spent about twenty five of those years in Yahoo city\nIn that time she noticed glaring proficiency problems\nWhen I was teaching fourth grade it was just too many that cannot read connect because if you can't reach can do math you can do anything\nAnd she says there was widespread instability well I'm\nAnd she says there was widespread instability\nWhat I'm saying and out of school and in public is going to a tunnel they're saying

reaching a fraction of ... cities twenty four hundred public school students\nAnd to help the poor school district in the state of Mississippi it's going to take a lot more than one teacher with a dream especially in a town in a county with high poverty that shows no signs of letting up\nSour Klein or as a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity and she recently traveled together through city as part of the abandoned in America series that we've been highlighting all week yeah I Do the school district\nThe municipal school district there is one of the worst in the state of Mississippi and that's one of the reasons why we decided to go there to talk to the people there to find out how they feel about their education system and to find out what can or is being done about it\nNow you visited four of the districts public schools can you tell us or described for listeners a little bit about what you saw what were the conditions like\nSo few of the schools are actually in very good shape they are modern there's new tables in the high school cafeteria and those were in good shape the oldest building and used by the district is Webster elementary school and this is for\nChildren who are just starting out this is for pre K. kindergarten and first grade students and the desks were marred from years of use their bathroom was a partially out of order\nThere with peeling paint in the hallways and you could tell that you know it had been repeated and repeated and repeated over and over again this is the facility where the heating system had gone out a couple of years ago and some parents tried to pay to have it fixed tried to help the school district\nAnd um then the heating system couldn't keep up last winter and one parent had to go and pick his child up early from school so it's in it's in rough shape and the issue is that they don't have\nThere are there just isn't a tax base there it's it's very low they don't have a lot of income coming in so they don't have the resources to pour into this old\nFacility let's talk a little bit about um race and how the demographics of the schools are playing into what you saw down their\nShirt so what I found in my reporting is that in Mississippi this is this happen has happened across the state forty nine of a hundred and forty five school districts\nAre more than three quarters African American Nineteen districts are more than three quarters white um so the schools there have re segregated in in a big way and this is particularly true in ... city\nWhere in Nineteen Seventy I'm black students entered white schools for the first time and they're after that period white students started going to private school or they moved out to Yahoo county and the school district there now is Ninety eight percent black\nAnd if you look across the state of Mississippi none of the districts that are more than three quarters lock R. Rated a or B none of the districts that are more than three quarters white R. Rated the or F the gravity of this situation cannot be overstated\nNow is that you mentioned that the tax base but is that really the only reason why the schools are where are you seeing the discrepancies in schools is it only financial what else was driving this\nSo there's there's a lot to buy the Southern Poverty Law Center and it was filed in twenty Seventeen it's on hold right now I'm actually a judge in Mississippi [noise] decided that the state of Mississippi couldn't be sued over this but I'm\nThe lawsuit against the state and it says that still have a separate and unequal school system that that there are differences between the quality of education there is a difference between the quality of education that black students are receiving end of quality of education that white students are receiving teacher retention quality of facilities\nUm income plays into all of this\n[noise] now you spoke to the districts new superintendent and the person's name is Georgia Ingram\nWas that that will challenge you face in the upcoming Eighteen Nineteen yeah at balances is to get committed to support the law that teacher and the ... and to lay should and we increase the reason that she made an ad teacher capacity to laugh at it\n[noise] she's the districts third superintendent in four years which indicates to me and not just instability but what's what's happening there\nIt's definitely a is definitely an unstable situation and when a district\nGets poor marks year after year after year it's very hard to retain a leader but what you know local folks were saying is that they need someone to stick around they need someone to stay and implement a plan\nSarah plain or as a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity Sarah thanks for joining us

the show gave us resident went missing for earlier this month is turkey now it's her does official tells the New York times that he was killed in the Saudi conflict pianist stumble on orders of the highest levels of\nThe Saudi Government with me on the line is Carlotta Gall to assemble bureau chief for the New York times Carlotta thanks for joining us pleasure to be with you can you remind our listeners who could show he is and why he was being targeted by the Saudi Government\n[noise] so he was one of the most outspoken critics but the most interesting thing for a lot of us who knew him\nOver the years was that he was well connected to the government he had served in the government you become a spokesman for some senior officials so for us we knew him that way\nAnd then lately she'd taken up a\nPoster with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away from Saudi Arabia and basically set up and self imposed exile in his in his criticism had increased so he was a real so on and the side as we see clearly now with his fate\nAnd you've been speaking to sources within the Turkish government car lot of what are the new developments here\nSo we've been following the day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the that the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and\nThey talked early on of his possible death\nUm and now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very from signs from Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public that\nClearly giving it to John honest to publish that those two groups of Saturday that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn to the second over a week ago and these officials that came flew in on private planes on the left the same day I'm\nSure the Saudi officials are\nTurkish officials Saudi officials Fifteen of them on two separate planes they came in in in a different times that day and they left\nThe same day and the judge officials are saying they were essentially I hit squad they were responsible for killing him this memory in his body and somehow disposing of it so the the mystery remains the investigation the types of now\nMounted an investigation they're asking the access to the consulate which of course is diplomatic ... that are also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid details in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nThe details all gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among their equipment we know they took several books is an suitcases out of the embassy or consulate building putting them and they'll call\n'em we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details um there's even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the premises off to it\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all in the United states obviously has close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play and the Turks I think have been keen to get international support on this because\nI'm everyone knows Saudi Arabia is a very powerful and rich nation especially in the Muslim world and so everybody being looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based\nHas been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from President Trump but also from vice president Pence and I think\nImportantly a more and more comments coming out of from congressman and senator so the American I think sided waking up and taking this more seriously as the information is coming out and it's becoming more and more clear what happened\nThis is a moment in which the United states
