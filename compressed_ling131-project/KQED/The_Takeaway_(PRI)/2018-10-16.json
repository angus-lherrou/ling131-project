back with you on the take away today I tend to have them in a video released this week Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren backed up her long contest getting claimed that she has Native American ancestry with results from a DNA test and Italian\nEight back to two thousand and twelve let her Republican challenger for the Senate Scott Brown accused\nWarn of using her Native American heritage to advance her career grand league brewers contributing editor for tribal affairs that high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation Hi Graham high your reaction to Elizabeth Warren's decision to take this test and put out this video I\nThought it was very interesting I Want to be very clear I'm not here to discredit her story or the common knowledge of her family that that she's been passed down I was more concerned about the way it was talked about and and I think the method this conversation with Elizabeth Warren\nAnd also President Trump has been very problematic from the beginning and I think using a DNA test to\nValidate that history ... was probably the wrong approach [noise]\nIt's interesting there because you don't want to criticize that gets her intentions for doing this but then it was actually what she did write the message the way that it was done with the issue a DNA test itself was it that it was covered ah by the media\nInappropriate we I think it's all of the above when we're covering Indian country will recover and tribal communities\nWe have to take not just look at the language we use but the way we talk about them the problem I had with senator warns approach was that it kind of fosters a narrative that as damaging to native people to give you a little bit of contacts I have a very similar story to Senator Warren I Am\nNot much darker than she is a outwardly the place where that video shot is probably just a couple of miles from my home I live in Norman, Oklahoma and that's where I'm Talking to you from now and so I don't fault her for wanting to know more about her history or in fact I Would encourage her to do so but I I think\nWhen you invite people to talk about the degree of of your blood quantum which is the degree of your Indian blood which is something that is documented by the government in in my case certainly you're opening up two conversations that feed into stereotypes and myths about native people\nBlood quantum is a very uh ... subject it's an institution of colonialism it was something that was put in place to essentially weed out our levels of of of native blood so by putting a stop on me\nA degree to which you're allowed to join your tribe which is a choice that tribes are able to make as they are sovereign nations\nThen it makes it less likely that your children will be able to be tribal members if they don't have the same amount of Indian blood is you do my tribe for instance the Cherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member\nUm to say that someone who is one eighth as more of a say or is more native than someone who is one thirty second for instance\nI I think is wrong I'm we're not just talking about a racial distinction here we're talking about a political distinctions has a citizenship question I Am a citizen of a sovereign nation as well as being a descendent of an indigenous person\nCan you help us understand a little bit more when you talk about blood quantum what does that mean a Native American community\nSo when the government put many of us on the trail of tears\nMy great great great grandfather for instance they wrote his name down\nWhere he was from and where he was headed to that record still stands and it makes it easy easier to trace my lineage back to my Cherokee roots that way I can show the nation that I Am a descendent of this person I Am a member of this nation and I can be enrolled as such\nNow some tribes have blood quantum in place uh my my son for instance is also part of Iowa\n... the ... nation of Oklahoma you have to be one fourth\nPilot to join the Navajo Nation is similar\nBut when it comes to a DNA test I think we need to keep in mind that a DNA test doesn't prove that you're a Native American there is no DNA test to shed say definitively you aren't indigenous person\nWhen it comes to tribal issues DNA tests are used to show who your parents are just show that lineage to show that you are a descendent of this person it's not a test that you can take to say yes I Am tired or I Am Cherokee or I Am Navajo\nI'm Wondering in terms of the media coverage of this did you feel like native perspective we're being included in the reaction to senator warrants decision um to release this video\nLike there was a lot of attention given to Senator Warren how she feels about Trump's rhetoric towards her which I Will agree is is not okay it's not acceptable the way President Trump speaks to her about race\nBut I felt there was more emphasis on how Senator Warren was affected by it rather than how her response affects indigenous people I think\nHer response helps foster this narrative that like I said to her blood quantum is important or that a DNA test can prove that your indigenous neither one of those things are true in reactions I have seen from indigenous scholars writers and just regular tribal members off the street\nIs is mostly one of anger they're not happy with the way that this has shaped the public discussion\nThey don't feel like Senator Warren has made efforts to understand them or their perspective\nAnd they feel again like\nTheir own narrative is being perverted and the public eye I think we need to keep in mind that when we're talking about indigenous communities we're talking about some of the most isolated communities in the country and I don't just mean physically yes some of those communities are isolated physically but there is an invisibility problem with Indian country\nNon native people by and large don't understand Indian country they don't under\nThings are true it reactions I have seen from indigenous scholars writers and just regular tribal members off the street is is mostly one of anger they're not happy with the way that this has shaped the public discussion they don't feel like Senator Warren has made efforts to understand them or their perspective\nAnd they feel again like their own narrative is being perverted and the public eye I think we need to keep in mind that when we're talking about indigenous communities we're talking about some of the most isolated communities in the country and I don't just mean physically yes some of those communities are isolated physically but there's an invisibility problem with Indian country\nNon native people by and large don't understand Indian country they don't understand sovereignty they don't understand a tribal membership and they don't understand like I was saying that this is a citizenship question as well as a racial distinction\nI think all of those things together just compound the problem of misperceptions and stereotype that permeates popular culture when it comes to Native American people\n... brewer is a reporter with the high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation grand thanks so much for your insights thanks for having [noise]\nSupport for the takeaway comes from

Fordham University and the author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights also with us is David ... author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center\nAnd Tanya I Want to pick up what you what is the driving force behind men in particular some men of color to have joined this group is that racism is it ... is it both\nIs both I mean talk about a paramedic intersection all example that is the conflation together of both the jet anti gender bias\nAnd racial bias the ways in which there is a I guess you know you would say for a toxic white masculinity and men of color are no exception to set of\nBeing seduced by the superficial power that that ah offers up\nIs it becoming easier to sell in this current climate\nIt is most definitely easy to sell because it combined both ah quotes of Martin Luther king about not being racist at the same time that it talks about whiteness as being a culture that is worth uplifting\nIf you could take away from this ah racism\nI'm just curious how it is that people of color who are not by definition white can engage with that type of thinking\nBecause what they do is they disassociate this idea of white and he says culture from racism and any anti blackness has also reduce the IDF oh it's not about black and I said about fat\nBlack culture David what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this a new form of hate group ideology that we're seeing across the United states [noise] well\nIn some ways it's actually very old I mean you know you started during this when I was covering Miriam nations and Idaho in late seventies early eighties\nAnd date to claim that they were only for a white [laughter]\nAnd it's one of the realities of for its promises group says that you know the claim to just be for white and\nDefending white interests but notably they're pro white advocacy becomes a tax on other races but that's not how they sell themselves and of course what really is the underlying dynamic here\nIs less white supremacist them than authoritarianism and that's what they're selling\nAnd authoritarianism crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries\nI'm you know we've got one of our main sort of a ... groups out here on the west coast is called patriot prayer and they're headed by a guy who's Japanese American and his right hand man has this big Simone drive so uh yeah ... and I see all kinds of non white is joining their rights\nBut when I talk to them every one of them has what we call it right wing authoritarian personality\nTania you wanted to weigh in here will\nSay that I just wanted to throw in the idea that um it's not new but yes it is in some respects and and as much as that\nNow these white supremacist groups are claiming to be welcoming to people of color I'm not just that they're pro white and is is just about culture and that they're not actually racist but they were OK with having non white members be part of their bandwagon\nAnd while they may be very much by authoritarianism and I agree with you there they're also spouting lots of\nWhite rhetoric and they don't think we should be dismissing that as I say in his budget has about authoritarianism it doesn't mean it's not about race\nYeah no that's absolutely right um it it is it's very interesting mix and it's also it's an interesting mix of all the new because\nAh they're marketing it in ways that I mean to always the radical right was very backward looking and the shape of the ... radical right as very savvy very media savvy and very forward looking which is a problematic\nWell I also want to talk about the initial response to this here at at least in New York City um the NYPD the New York police department said on Monday that it did have plans to arrest a nine members of the Proud Boys and three more anti fascist opponents but\nFootage from the fight that night shows the police arriving they disperse the crowd but none of the Proud Boys actually were arrested and there were some accusations that the police the NYPD didn't do enough\nTo stop the attackers there was also an assumption that there was support here from the implicit support for the the the Proud Boys from the NYPD David do you think there's a level of support within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys\nI Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement system throughout the country right now and it's being you know very heavily politicized by organizations like the oath keepers\nA which specifically you know centrally patriot very far right organization that is recruiting law enforcement uh a on there\nBeing invested in the white supremacists authoritarianism\nI think are very much swayed by the idea that what they are serving our it's just about free speech I think the smoke our chest spouting their ideas\nAnd I think that part of the underlying problem here is\nThe stereotype of the United states as being so absolute is about free speech that you can say any kind of hateful thing on the street and it doesn't matter and it doesn't seem to me that it results in violence although history shows how intimately ... intertwined racist speech is with racist violence\nI Do want to point out that we did reach out to the NYPD to take away did for comment about their response specifically to this incident and also\nThe claim that Gavin McGinnis said that he actually was supported by the end my P. D. so I'm going to read you a brief um a response from the NYPD and they said that they called McGinnis an individual who's a provocateur tour who does not speak for the NYPD\nThey say the NYPD is a diverse institution dedicated to keeping safe all eight point five million New Yorkers violence and disorder like what occurred on October twelve is unacceptable and will not be tolerated and the the statement does go on to what they did respond to this request\nAt the national level what do you see uh do you see this as a trend that's going to continue to catch on is this something that'll come back underground what's your experience tell you\nYeah my experiences doesnt really helped [laughter] just because this is all ... I'm I'm obviously I think we all hope it goes back on the ground but I'm not very helpful in that regard because I think this is very much a creature of the Internet\nDavid night where it is the author of alt America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center and tiny Hernandez is a professor of law at Fordham University and author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights\nComing up we'll look at the economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia stay with us [noise]\nOf the takeaway comes from ... a language that teachers realized conversations in a new language like\nSpanish French foreign Germans battles ten to Fifteen minute lessons are available in the app store or online at ...
