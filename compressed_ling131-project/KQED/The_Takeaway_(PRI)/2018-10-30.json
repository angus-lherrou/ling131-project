years\nEvery ... feeling between three hundred seven hundred barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico Taylor Energy has cleaned up some of the math but they've also been feeling the government to avoid a phone clean up on the site and if the spill is not stop soon it's\nOn track to become one of the worst in us history\nMichael ... is a reporter with the Associated Press and he's been reporting on the Taylor oil spill for years Michael thanks for joining us thanks for having me after shift to this spill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which were put together by independent researcher from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily\nFrom multiple wells around a platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan in two thousand and four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years is that your energy company based in New Orleans that doesn't have the assets anymore is essentially only exist to fight the spill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end this leak they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started here down below the surface and the Gulf\nObviously there's a money issue here but what is it about this spill that why is it taking so long for this to stop this looks like it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard\nWell hadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that that's true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that though while I mean that's I think that's open to debate certainly and um the government's position is very different that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do what they can the problem is\nIs that when that hurricane roll through and knocked over\nThe uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of a settlement that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life that's the company the company says no company did kill some of the wealth they said but\nThey said that nothing more can be done without causing potentially greater risk if they go in there and they\nTake the settlement away could make a week even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government\nAnd the company about what needs to be done next but the government police or something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else down there below the surface\nI'm just wondering the killer oil spill is back in the news but its rivaling this BP oil spill in twenty can I Can't forget the image in since the BP

can be ...\nBy waves and water and it doesn't have quite the same impact also the company has said that there is no evidence\nThat this oil from the tail ... is reaching shores about twelve miles off the coast of Louisiana and the slick stretch for miles every day or almost every day but\nFlex also have an impact on the environment whether we can feed them or not I mean who's supposed to make sure
