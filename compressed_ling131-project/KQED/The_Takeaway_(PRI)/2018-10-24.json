almost two weeks ago from Honduras\nThe migrants have now reached southern Mexico where many requesting asylum others will continue the arduous weeks long journey by flipped to the United states the president has made no secret of his feelings about certain groups of immigrants [noise]\nYou wouldn't believe how bad the streets [noise]\nYour animals they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime there rape is they are not our friends believe me I don't Jay Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United states\nSo we want to take some time today to do some

you're going to find everything I guess what we're not allowed in August we want to say [noise]\nHere to help us unpack all of this is Ron next and the New York times correspondent covering the department of homeland security Ron thanks for being with us and thanks for having me\nSo lots of stuff to take into consideration here we just heard the president's comments about uh they're being middle Easterners and the caravan he later said he had no proof of that but\nClearly this was a dog whistle I'm thinking who within the caravan Ron what do we know\nThese are people that are primarily migrating and speaking to a an asylum primarily coming from Honduras and I understand that there's some people from Guatemala and maybe a couple of other places in the northern trying all countries [noise] but uh and looks largely like it's it's a group of people coming from Honduras\nNow we also heard I'm Mike Pence vice president Mike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who we're seeing that there are about ten terrorists or suspected terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that they are set around the caravan let's take a listen to a vice president Pence\nWill it's inconceivable that there are not um people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand\nPeople eventually toward our border\n... well let me let me just ... I mean in in the last fiscal year\nAre we are apprehended more than more than ten\nTerrorists were suspected terrorists per day at our southern border from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as other than Mexico that means from the middle east region\nRon does other than Mexico mean from the middle east\nLived in Mexico includes everybody from Mexico\nOkay not a direct women are okay no\nNo including people from the northern triangle and and that's primarily who's been referred to as other than in Mexico but it it really does include anyone who is not from Mexico and nuts because\nTraditionally up until a few years ago most of the people seeking to come across the border either get asylum or across the border illegally were people from Mexico\nAnd non what about those stats the vice president is citing about terrorists being apprehended at the border\nThat staff that the vice president mentions come from um customs and border protection the parent agency of border patrol and it basically says that\nThe agency prevents tend known or suspected terrorists from traveling to are entering the United states every day and just go two thousand ah Seventeen\nIt makes no mention of them being apprehended at the border and it doesn't say specifically that they're coming\nTo the southwest border that typically has meant that these people are being stopped from coming with the airports so yeah it it's called fleeting as that that is meant to be one thing with\nThe whole care of and it and it has nothing to do as far as I can tell with this caravan of people\nHe's also made some claims about him is Thirteen and I don't want to minimize the concern about him is Thirteen um but I Do want to check with you to see is there any evidence of MS Thirteen so far being a part of this group or having any influence over this group\nI haven't seen anything that that suggests that image Thirteen or ... is a part of the group in the president's comments about the camera and go in the middle of a caravan and you'll see him as Thirteen I I don't know what your mess Thirteen would look like I mean there are certainly\nYou know a members that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who is ... in Rochester team looks like that so [noise] you know as far as as I Know and from my colleagues on the ground here and and my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles out when it comes to race and politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans nervous here around do you think that's why they're doubling down on this rhetoric just two weeks before the midterm election\nThink the immigration I'm you know obviously it it helped him president get elected and this has been one of\nWhat does that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who's ... MS Thirteen looks like that so [noise] you know as far as as I Know and from my colleagues on the ground here and and my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles so when it comes to race and politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans nervous here around do you think that's why they're doubling down on this rhetoric just two weeks before the midterm election\nI think immigration I'm you know obviously it it helped him president good elected and this has been one of which is not the signature issue for this administration\nAnd I think that for a lot of Republicans ... place whoa a particularly now UC cameras with this crowd of people coming to the country and you can point to see they're they're they are they're the people who are trying to to get into our country\nUm so I think for them you know it's it's an issue or that they feel they can do some traction with as you know political scientists and posters are predicting a blue wave particularly high in terms of taking a house representative\nYeah we've also heard a Mike Pence said that it is a the caravan of the Venezuelan plot um the president has suggested that the caravan as being supported by Democrats and George source of his name has been tossed about\nCan we confirm any of those claims\nThere is no evidence that the Democrats are George Soros or Venezuela have sponsors of this particular care man and woman but this is something that happened earlier this year too there was a caravan of people coming to the U.S and most of them\nActually didn't make the trip to the U.S it it sort of petered out before it actually got to the U.S border so ultimately we don't know what's gonna happen\nWith this group of people because they're about a thousand miles away\nRight which is more than Miami to New York from what I Am right now yeah right and they're walking right so take\nThat into consideration thank you Ron Nixon is a correspondent for the New York times covering the department of homeland security Ron thank you so much thank you [noise]\nGo to the way it comes from European made language learning program babble teaches practical conversation into your Russia Swedish another language on the app store or online a B.

Daniel\nVenting as an editor and reporter for ... D science in San Francisco and she's been reporting on the measure as well as the origins of the practice and the case against it today Danielle thanks for being with us on the takeaway\nThank you for having me so what is where did this ballot measure come from who wanted to eliminate daylight saving time in California\n[noise] this is from the state assembly member it's sponsored by a state assembly member in San jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents um it was his dentist actually showed him medical studies\nThat link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spraying increased stroke traffic accidents and heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to ... o'clock changes\nThere's pretty good data that that loss of sleep on throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented fan and puts them at higher risk of all of those things\nSo it's not just that we're grumpier there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for ... like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why a prop seven wants to be a white white folks are pushing props up [noise]\nYeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice test which clocks so there's some popular support for keeping the clocks steady or around also when we are using daylight savings time we have that more light in the evening and there is some economic\nBenefit because in public health benefit because people are exercising their out eating at restaurants they're playing sport to watch their dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place can\nYou remind us [noise] yeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time auditors in the late Seventeen hundred\nHe was living in France he was the American ambassador to Paris and it was his habit to sleep or to work late late into the evening riding by candlelight until three or four in the morning and then he would sleep until about noon\nAnd one morning he got woken up by this loud sound at six AM and realize oh the sun's up I could be I could be using the sunlight to write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles on but it wasn't until World War one\nThat it was really adopted by countries it was a Germany\nThat was the first country to Institute it and then I'm all of the countries that were involved in the war effort adopted daylight saving time to save energy and he did use to save some energy it doesn't save much now it seems um\nIt was then made optional between the wars brought back again and the United states for World War two\nAnd in California voters and voted to Institute that the daylight saving time schedule that we have now uh in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switch to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil crisis can you tell us what happened\nThat [noise] [noise] yeah I'm President Nixon ordered year round daylight saving time for two years to save to save energy during the OPEC oil embargo by it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold there\nDark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress ended the experiment I'm a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you you mentioned\nUh in Nineteen forty nine now some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switched to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil crisis can you tell us what happened that\n[noise] yeah I'm President Nixon had ordered year round daylight savings time for two years to save to save energy during the OPEC oil embargo\nBut it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold there dark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress ended the government um a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um those of us in the north and maybe hurts those of us in the south who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator but the share of light versus dark is of course much more drastic in the northern latitudes [noise] you know on the equator we have\nTwelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light so for instance California if there's proposition passed and California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in the in the shortest days of the year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state that would it wouldn't rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners um for what they thought about this idea and there were lots of folks who supported as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California voter\nHello I'm Alexis from Los Angeles as the California and and it's pointless measures that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness education athlete for immigration reform\nLifted them even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take I Know\nWe've just got a coming up on the end of the segment here but it's not an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to make this change\nYou know the fiscal impact it's really unclear it would require some extra money to coordinate airline flights and you know with other states but it also could save money with decreased accidents and increased
