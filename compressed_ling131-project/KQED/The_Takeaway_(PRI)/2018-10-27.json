speaking to today from the stage with opera house at the Brooklyn Academy of music in New York City [noise]\nAnd here are not for how safe for the story that is so small it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room this ground\nIt's actually about a real opera singer not a super famous upper singer or anything like that person go free makes about half of our living singing the other half she makes recording audio books and about a year ago she was staying at a hotel\nAnd she had a deadline when his children's books that she was supposed to be recording and hotel room was kind of noise is using other noise from the street and digital driver quiet places you went into the closet put pillows all around two dead and the sound\nSound before with microphone and then the court and the microphone went under the door of the closet out to her laptop because her laptop had a fair and that made noise that's what causes the door\nSo it's pitch dark except for the light from her eye pad which had the text of the book that you're supposed to read that you began\nThe exciting exploits an effort doesn't alf written by Tricia sugar rack and married it by kind give free\nChapter one where his asthma the enchanted\nForest was deep and green splashed 'cause it would it be incredible if I just ... the entire audio book [noise]\nHe paid like eighty five bucks for the future [noise]\nActually I can put you to hold audio book because current gets exactly like two and a half sentences into this book and she stumbled on words he was like oh wait I'll just I'll just start again at the start from

[noise]\n[laughter]\nOh my God [noise]\nThe guy told me at first she thought like this isn't going to be that hard right after all she has the pet is why she could call the front desk on Skype right and there was a problem\nThis wife I was like half of one bar and it kept just cutting out but I found the hotel number\nIs ... is on the recording into six six one nine six zero zero [noise] down there [noise]\n\nThank you for calling the hotel we can relate to the phone for additional information about the hotel we get our website\nAnd then of course like the longest hotel phone menu ever\nSat down and have nice boy scouting for [noise]\nFor the team in his office\nAnd like trying to pressure zero to get to the operator and I'm thinking the wife I was gonna cut out at any moment so I'm listening to like this giant long menu and finally I hear\nIt anytime you're listening to an operator hey [noise]\nLike eight [noise]\nReservation Ajmi thinking they succeeded Hi I'm actually in room eleven thirty\nCan you hear me can you hear me [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just like total silence nothing happens except every now and then turn\nJust laughed to herself [noise]\nOne minute and forty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds from forty four seconds and then when the recording you're here [laughter] [noise]\nNow and then she tries to handle again thinking she told me later you know this can really be true I just kept this got to be with us going to work\nOne wall because it had the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after ... yourself in she hears people\nShe hears people do you hear some German tourists\nWalking towards her down the hall and\nFortunately she actually has the skills\nFor this very situation [noise]\nGermans come to the door of the room they whisper to each other for\nA little bit and then they do nothing [noise]\n[noise]\nHer husband is I don't know ... or a singer and if I was turned off she checked her mom you're nothing back she found her mom and ready then somebody taps on the door the hotel room and cause the ... are you okay\nCan you come to the

she was so nice oh my gosh she was so nice\nI Know this is a weird question but like is it appropriate to tip in a situation like that [noise]\nI don't know I didn't think of it than\nNot turned remember issued an opera singer right an opera is all about the spectacle you know eighty people on the stage and horses and vengeance being grand feeling it was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her or him back closet right all the action takes place in a space not much bigger than your body it is the symbolism pot imaginable there's literally no movement in this plot if someone would just age this as an opera\nHow would that go [laughter] [noise]\nUm it might be minimal and music actually a right [noise]\nLike you're repeating beam over and over and over again with me yelling help [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd you know people say those kinds of things in interviews and then I put the quarter to be under the story and make sure that then they put a little funky music under it and maybe you've heard our show [noise]\nBut when we did this interview like three or four weeks ago I wrote a witness and if a once in my life I don't have to let the story stop here I'm actually going to be in an opera house very soon I can retire with this I can take that to the next logical step by step it never gets you to step you need an opera house for\nAnd
