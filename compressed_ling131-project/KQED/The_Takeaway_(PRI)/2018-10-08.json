stricter work requirements for public assistance at the same time unemployment is at three point seven percent and the stock market is booming\nSo is the war on poverty really one well this week we're working with the center for Public Integrity to check in on parts of the country that are still struggling with poverty our first stop today pre city oh Texas the small poor border town depends on its relationship with all he not on Mexico just steps away across the Rio Grande\nThe town would also be directly impacted by the president's proposed border wall [noise]\nI think\nThere's a lot of\nHours from places like\nThat I mean that's why [noise]\nThey love and solace here to tell us all about this he's the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway good to be with your temperature so what is per city of Texas like ...\nPercent of your Texas is sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nIn our reporters who hunter Hussein who spent some time this summer down there found a place that really cut against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on its cross border sister town in Mexico ... Mexico and as a result quite literally people depend on ... for\nThe basics of life groceries water a transportation family there is such a cultural connection almost a symbiosis there that were border wall to be built um most of the people there feel as if the community would be not only cut off but even killed by its own country and they feel that\nThe debate in Washington is a world away from the reality that they're living down there I ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty or not a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel go well beyond a border wall they don't want the wall at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going to quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty is largely over what is the main concern for folks and ... if it's not immigration if it's not the wall is poverty or is it something else [noise]\nPoverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health a very odd twist it in the story is that if you have a a an injury or if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere's only the most rudimentary basic medical care available in ... in ... and you have to rely on the hospitals and knock out to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be met a pact to a Texas a city that\nAre in minimum will be an hour away and if you really need serious care it could be four hours away by car so as a result of people feel very isolated they feel that a Washington and the federal government in a way is not eating their concerns\nThis is a place for up until a couple of years ago the many of the streets were unpaved him a city literally a dirt road town so something that you would expect to not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty\nWhy is this now and it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative in effect for health care um Americans having to go across the border into Mexico to get health care I just want to make sure I understood that correctly\nThat's that's true and I even for a non critical carrier your dentist might be there is certainly a other\nSundry isn't in daily necessities might be there to sail health both in an acute situation but also to and and just keeping yourself a fender keeping your family fed and making sure that that you have the basics of daily life and this was a really the reality there and\nIf it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to to flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... where they have to come to bear\nOh it also seems to you again also fly in the ... in the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall\nUm when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities\nYou know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country um and we'll be focusing on those throughout throughout the week but tell us why\nYou chose the places you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells the story that's different about the nation's war on poverty\nYou alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump by as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market\nIs at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well must underscore that but there are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that\nThey are struggling and might be an issue of education we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell her incredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where housing is such an issue on everyone's mind or should I say the lack there of\nHow we go to a place like Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota where people feel incredibly disenfranchised so all these places that we may have only gone to sex but a representative of many other places throughout the country whether\nIt's the uh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana

to participate or even if they can participate the reality for a lot of people\nSimply when you're working three jobs and just trying to make ends meet and keep your head above the poverty line it's

of twenty five people selected by the MacArthur Foundation to receive what's in formerly known as a MacArthur genius fellowship a grant of six hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that recipients can use however they'd like over the course of five years it allows us\nTo be able to practice our and to have space and time to create new work\nWithout having to have the burden of figuring out where our income is going to be derived from you know we don't have to find supplemental jobs to be able to do the work that we do we can actually just beat the writers that we were sort of been pushing to be all of our career\nMore recently has already carved out an impressive career for herself writing the Broadway bound musical into proud about the temptations and serving in the writers' room for the Showtime series shameless she's also authored a series of place set in Detroit a city that's central to her identity [noise]\nI'm from Detroit I was born and raised there and my husband's from Detroit in my family lives there and so for me Detroit is personal it's about family I always say that Detroit is also a metaphor for black America in this country and then therefore America large I think so when people are\nLooking at the city where sort of looking at the social narrative a a narrative of our race and economics and our nation and so for me it's important to be writing about that in\nWriting from a place of within a\nSo much love for the city because I have some of his family there and and I have such a really particular upbringing there and so\nI don't feel like Detroit has had very human picture painted about it in terms of media exposure and so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that's held more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent plays you take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and I'm at very young ages and um something that's become a huge problem in in the United states how do you take a topic like that\nAnd bring it to the stage and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic\nWell first of all I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park Michigan which has a\nA I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit um and so because of that I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I've spent so much time in so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships or\nTo teaching because of that as a public school teachers and privacy with teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles and so my flight pipeline is about looking at it through a mother who's trying to write her son but also a mother who's a teacher and a public school so we get to see\nHer relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and his relationships that private school system and we're looking at\nBasically within the two forms of education how institutions can fail children an educator both in the public school maybe infrastructure ally but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not\nHaving enough space for the total humanity in their emotion out of the young especially young black and brown boys and our nation\nAnd so that was important for me to try to explore\nOur producer who was putting the segment together found a an interview that you've done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now as opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think\nYou were referring there to the opportunities that women of color specifically have within a the creative fields tell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color play right\n[noise] well I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochures of things and it looks like if a structural change you know you have to change in leadership and we're seeing that evidenced in\nLarge and small wave and our nation right now right leadership it comes from the top down\nAnd so on because that in theater in particular it it means programming is decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron\nHow they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience they're they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to have a very diverse backgrounds and for women of color\nTo be in positions of power and where they are making those decisions\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November for that the patron or freedom theater FHM ... death dot com\nOr what I feel that it doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color in the audience there has\nTo be a an entire collective shift that invites audiences of diverse backgrounds entered the house to have an experience together that's what makes the special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\n... Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development I think that there's an assumption about what people of color will not spend that money on and that is ... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or wall spend it on things out of the significant fall\nI think it is also it's about cultivating a relationship that makes people want to spend their money on something that's what the your head and figure it out but I Do also think\nAffordability of ticket is a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed in theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when you're talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means\nYou cannot expect people to come to you leave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house while I'm not that I can I have\nMy food so it comes to your house and eat junk food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples like why would I spend money comes out to eat the food and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to\nYou have to me give me some samples to bring me out and show me that I'm not just a flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship was that if that kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active about\nDominique worry so it's a playwright whose work includes skeleton crew and pipelines thank you so much so many thank you [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat takes away we'll be right back to bring us when he won the Nobel subscribe to the last ... hot hats on I tunes or\nMm\nSupport for kick you eat eat today comes from S H M presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical\nFrom the creators of Les Mis [noise] or job or nine through November for that but yes agent or feed him the details of FHM as half dot com and by Comcast Business offering Internet voice some video solutions\nDesigned to help businesses maximize performance so the focus can remain on employees and customers learn more business dot com cast on Tom we invite you to rediscover the magic of the American circus with a four hour mini series\nChronicling the rise and fall of one of our nation's most iconic forms of entertainment to\nThe circus premieres tonight at nine o'clock on ...
