our\nQuestion for the ... year old fashioned describe your reaction to when you got there was\nFor [noise] a\nSo the first part of my reaction to hearing that we had a possible match\nOr just validated my unbelievable faith and confidence in mental image of law enforcement and in particular of the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who worked there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had to print\nI was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves\nA it's important to say as as is in the complaint\nOr that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say is what we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which if subjected to the right combination of heat or chocolate friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device that recording\n[laughter] could you tell us plainly why was the target [noise]\n[noise]\nI don't know and then uh what you might uh normally expect a man apart if appears to be a partisan but that would be a determined by the facts as the case goes forward and I'm not able to comment on that [noise]\nWe're not going to be wary of education stance at this um [noise]\nWhat tone [noise]\nGiving you [noise] were\nFocus not on the talk but on the work the work of the men and women in law enforcement here and the work that was done over the last week is

habitat for endangered green sea turtles and monk seals\nToday it is mostly underwater hurricane will lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in chip you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\n[noise] well it was quite stunning [noise] um I had\nSponsorship that they can't you do you live stream science than any firm Comcast extend Internet delivers in home life high for all devices in the home\nHe said that might a head into French forget shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures of here and now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical because the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles 'cause I'm digs their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd there are only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one or that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah I'm the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points for the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the during area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses can they turn to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional\nSandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... sand did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer's yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's still a very strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or other other problems that you first see happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice island uh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... says last year as hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking or with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island to come back someday\n[noise] there is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was moved by the hurricane to the north and north east\nThe trade when waves\nMay push that Sam back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion\nOr building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling sea level around two thousand years ago we are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming the signing a don't exist\nThat chip Fletcher a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yes thank you\nAnd on the conversation now with connections to climate is meant pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of ... according to government figures out today\nOne of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody but our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing chowder easy executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he\nSays if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because the focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nAre lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic crafts there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made an extra activism than there is in rent and sorts of St ability\nUm so actually what we need to rethink be searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policy shift about the way the match in politics the lady imagining\nI actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rate what they mean something like oh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity\nUm but I actually know I can do nice pair comparison right um they are very high growth rates in China we are very high growth safe in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is a lot of what we associate with gross\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution will mean other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talking about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really [laughter]\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there is like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nGets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like\nHow have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice what\nKind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so I could sort of not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that it's trying to move the needle to give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money\nIs going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary thought how movement give us an example\nYou can think of to sort of a tendencies one is the sort of rise above sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation\nAnother would be very local organizations but with a sort of very grand division or this will be groups like cooperation Jackson, Mississippi who are really trying to build a sort of eat go I'm sustainable society from the ground up meaning look\nOh meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nA system of greater democratic government they are trying to and they are succeeding in some ways a to build a sort of ego sustainable city from the ground up including agriculture including manufacturing\nComing up on fresh air Terry Gross talks with music critic Anthony to criticize about his biography of Lou Reed depressed was also reached friend and interviewed many people he knew including two of his former wives stay with us there'll be some music trend and I'm sure fresh air it starts at one [noise]\nUm [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from carbon I offering secure data protection solutions for growing businesses\nIncluding automatic back up for services in computers high availability and disaster recovery solutions an automated data migration\nLearn more carbon I dot com and from Sen gauge working to make higher education more affordable with the same gauge unlimited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each textbooks online homework access codes and study guides\nSend gauge unlimited C.
