was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's we're both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me

saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make\nDecisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that one of our program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes from the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with that when you make right with another person usually it's something they've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays a kind of the bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things that many of the episodes are really funny uh the one that we have today is\nA more serious one and here's Johnny books there\nIn two thousand and eight ... received a letter for jury duty you\nKnow lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing oh no I Hope it don't give jury duty but I was more serious than interested in like the the process and you know I like to watch and stuff like law and order and other things like that\n... co workers might over here he took\nThe call outside behind his office building [noise] it was there\nSaid he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI Fox incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince\nEveryone to choose life imprisonment when in\nFact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one descending those votes fan could have passed so that would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole [noise] know would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nUm [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something fan never expected or wanted\n... mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness should or even a hands if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing\nThat there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with are still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her Mrs ... how do you mean\nWell I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that are like ... ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nAlready did begin to apply but I didn't have the\nCourage to [noise] finishers and it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like a really read things up [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was that the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents who the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always has been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want pasta or a family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of is deet\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nFor not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not drying [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or\nEven the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain and our intelligence acted upon by an external forests in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Marilyn a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too forward ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Maryland right\nI have no ill will toward Mr burglar I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply shelter forward to her original email just fan once you send two years ago the one who can stop thinking about when I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that fan consumed by guilt\nWould read so much interest so little but what I don't understand is why Marilyn sent in the mail in the first place\n... ah you know I have\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get package at all or some\n... some of that stuff I don't know\nSome some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in the hotel suite downtown where I can stop offering a food that she can see opera fusing you want to have a coffee or tea know\nMaryland is told in stately with smiling eyes she's in ... to the crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll makes you you have Marilyn there 'cause she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about a safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off it's worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our powders to cause some out of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow and I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPowell appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years it\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting now so that's a ...\n... um um [noise] I'm\nTen years after the trial and everyone her friends or family\nHave all moved on to win Maryland red Ben's article\nShe signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay center the death penalty\nI thought I had that I I thought I had literally died it didn't even register because I'm just like you know what just happened what have they done you know\nMy whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing\n'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he has and I want people to know you know everybody has their own that if you involved in a heinous crime that the two monster but he went to the monster\n[noise]\nI think there is no okay so she is going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk\nFor I think that probably then they sit in at the end it's been yeah yeah fan\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before he gets it [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice their fans span this at the door [noise]\nAnd then I've gone to an insane I mean there are some errands here now how do you\nThat then there was no okay\nI get a lot of Venn lingers in the door the hotel room down or have over there uh he's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous [noise] and so\nThere were there with a lifetime Maryland in Spanish and been in the same room was ten years ago if you have to trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar spent that and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty
