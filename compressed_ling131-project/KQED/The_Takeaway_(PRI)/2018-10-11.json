we've been talking with reporters at the center for Public Integrity about their series abandoned in America which explores cities and towns across the country where poverty is inescapable\nIn St Louis Missouri a major component of the crisis is affordable housing there just isn't enough of it and for many of the residents who do manage to get a subsidized place to live conditions only add to the indignity of living and working in poverty\nMole inside the apartment and so they did was set of getting rid of the mole they just have a say so after a lot of the stuff was coming through you

paid for with help from a federal section ... voucher program but even though she works full time January says the assistance she's getting is not enough\nAnybody that is one ... for or other some housing assistance they need it nobody is using that if they are low income families you know again sables words people were three part time job is not a deal if\nThere's a big discrepancy in St Louis and economy that President Trump likes to boast is stronger than ever and the stagnant under class of people trapped in poverty and challenged every month to keep a roof over their heads that's what we teach the beach I'm a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity found in her reporting\nIn St Louis especially in the city of about twenty six point seven percent\nOf the people there are living below the federal poverty level is very difficult if you are very low or extremely low income to find affordable housing and specially if you need a sense\nThe last time the city opened its housing choice voucher commonly known as section eight and twenty fourteen so when you have people waiting years hoping that they'll be able to receive a voucher\nA for housing that will accommodate them and their children I'm there also are waiting list for a public housing in the city in the county as well\nNow what are your options if you are waiting for a section ... voucher ... what do you do in the meantime\nIt's not really a pretty picture and people are either an unstable conditions there living with family members that might even be facing homelessness where they're living in sub par a housing conditions as they wait for years to find housing\nI'm curious if you can help us understand how the section eight voucher program work and um I Know it's a complicated program there are many different kinds but what what is it generally do\nYes so with the U.S section ... housing choice voucher system it allows for a person to seek housing through a privately owned property um and\nThe federal government will pay a subsidy to the section eight accepting landlord and the tenant will pay the difference uh based on their income\nTell us about January Harris January here is um lives out in Ferguson, Missouri she lives in the county of St Louis within a week of her moving into her\nTown home for her and her youngest daughter Michael Brown was killed by police officer in that housing complex is just\nA two minute drive away and she had worked for most of her time as an adult down at least I went back to her work history back to two thousand\nAnd so she is technically checking off the personal responsibility boxes that\nPresident Trump Ben Ben Carson has said are ways to get out of this system but at the end of the day it's just not enough she does make money she does technically an above the state minimum wage jobs seven eighty five\nBut even with that it's it's hard for her to make ends meet because as soon as she got her job at um a local nonprofit in St Louis before she got her first paycheck her rent had increase\nSo I get paid by the water goes completely for the rest of us who are getting those were\nNot receiving any child for\nI work every day for ... I mean they they made a problem like this is supposed to be specific voted family says reservations were they not me say this and there's no way to get off I was literally probably\nShe's essentially not able even with her current employment able to even get off of section ... housing right now because money is just too tight\nIs the housing situation that you're describing where there's limited housing available and long wait times for section ... vouchers is that being exacerbated by gentrification\nAt all\nI think when it comes to public housing and section eight housing I'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my sense a through my reporting is that\nThey housing authorities are wander highly underfunded um and that is not a partisan or something unique to this administration\nInto it can be difficult to find landlords who want to accept a section eight housing choice voucher holders because of all the stigma that come with that rented that's racism or whether that's your fear that they may not care for the property\nAnd also for the landlord a there is a long process of paperwork and inspections that goes into whether or not you choose to be a section eight lamb or so I think it's a lot of bureaucracy at play the reason why it's so hard to find affordable housing\nWell let's also talk about um what the current administration's stance is when it comes to public housing I'm thinking specifically about Ben Carson a HUD secretary who essentially ... did a twenty Fifteen rule\nThat require communities that receive hot funding make an effort to integrate their neighborhoods where does that stand\nIn the Nineteen fifties in the Nineteen sixties\nStance in the Nineteen fifties and the Nineteen sixties there was a wave of white flight to the suburbs\nAnd what you have now is a county that is mostly white and in the city it's pretty much predominantly black\nSo there is concerned that there will be more division because of the undoing of this rule because it's no longer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your communities\nThe president has said that the war on poverty is largely over a desire to reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually um when I was visiting various communities especially along the north side\nPeople are just pointing around saying hey look at this look at all these empty houses look at all these abandoned homes nobody is coming here and people are concerned about how they're going to make ends meet\nThat economic prowess and growth that Trump sees for America doesn't really reconcile with what I saw in much of the city\nThat he should be to them as a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity ... thanks for your reporting Oh thank you

black women running for federal office forty one black women are running for the house thirty five of whom are Democrats\nThat's the most in recent years according to the center for American women and politics at Rutgers University\nThese women are trying to close the big representation gap but that heightened visibility comes with a different set of challenges in late August coyote more is the only black woman in Vermont legislature dropped out of her reelection race because of racist on line threats and harassment\nBlack women also face extra hurdles when campaigning like gathering funding and national endorsements\nKimberly peeler Allen is here to talk about these issues and she's the co founder of higher heights for America and organization working to elect black women for public office Kimberly thanks for joining us\nAs a pleasure to be here what an interesting topic this is um let's talk a little bit about motivation right what I mean we were hearing this is the year if the woman and everybody wants to run for office but there's one is particularly driving women of color more specifically black women to run for office well I think it is um\nYou know this confluence of events that we aren't that we find ourselves in a black woman had been running and doing the work behind the scenes for generations you know thinking back to like Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan you know women had been in black women have been in the trenches\nAnd now there is this new sense of urgency we're seeing the attempt and in many cases the actual reality of the roll back for the last fifty years of progress\nAnd we're seeing that black women are saying I Can't let this happen to my community so I'm going to step up and run and it is um that combined with\nUh the electorate realizing that you know over eighty percent of our elected officials across the country are white and male\nAnd that is you know by no means represents the diversity in this nation and the electorate is saying you know we need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd these black women are speaking to my issues are regardless of you know the fact that they're black or they can appeal to everybody and it has really been a great um catalysts for all of these women to run such strong primaries and you know we're really looking forward\nTo some great pickups on November sex so let's talk a little bit about that because there are some challenges specifically and we know politics is is like any other industry right there are challenges as we mentioned to funding and and getting support here\nUm yesterday and the show we talked about how important black women are to the Democratic party they've been called the backbone of the Democratic party Ninety percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and yet they still lacking representation and the party's leadership one of the guests that we had raised this notion of viability of black women candidates\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think black women candidates are thought of by the Democratic party as less viable because of who they are because they can't raise the money because they won't give them to support what is that about um I think that's exactly it ice higher heights was born out of the notion\nThat we needed a space for a black woman a political home for black women and Glenda car and I we knew from our experience that the factors that make a black woman a viable candidate or not necessarily the same as our white counterparts\nAnd we know that by mobilizing our networks because that is what we do just you know to make life happen for so many of us\nAnd the volunteer effort and the word of mouth and then also be bringing our authentic selves or to the campaign trail has really been a a great factor in the successes so we've always looked at\nKennedy to a walk in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm on bought and on boss we look at what kind of\nA volunteer structure they have we look at a you know do they have\nEnough money to reach their constituents we don't need you know the hundreds of millions of dollars that so many of these races costs but do you have the baseline of what it's going to take for you to reach your target voters and do you have a solid campaign plan\nAnd you know are you in line with issues that we believe will make sure that black women in their communities and their families thrive\nWe should also note that Nineteen of the black women who are running for the house are challenging incumbents here now that could work to their favor or not depending on what we talked about which is funding you know how often is the ability to raise money part of the viability of a candidate right because you mentioned you don't need hundreds and millions and millions of dollars but\nAre there specific barriers to fund raising that black women candidates face in particular\nYeah well I think there is you know just unfortunately the um institutional wealth\nOr we haven't been here that long we've had a challenges to our communities that have not allowed us to a map or the the type of wealth that some of our counterparts have uh the fact that black women are making a sixty three cents on the dollar just you know from the jump you know we we need our whole dollar if we're going to be competitive\nThe jump you know we we need our whole dollar if we're going to be competitive but I think it is also thinking through it's not just that the large checks but ah being able to mobilize our networks for those you know monthly five dollar contributions that add up over time\nAnd see those ah you know contributions as a strength because they're not just dollars but they're also voters and most likely volunteers and it's also a question of actually getting people to the polls I mean you can spend all the money you want I think we saw that\nHere in New York will out of what I Would send you a copy of Cortez who nobody thought you know this person was going to win and then she wins ... people showed up at the polls how important is that for black women candidates absolutely\nIt is that that is the deciding factor we have to show up and show out at the polls to make sure that our voices are heard make sure that we have voices around the decision making tables that reflect our priorities and there's a lot of racist this that and just in the midterms will be watching Stacey Abrams had a bunch of other folks\nKimberly pillar Allen is the cofounder of higher heights for America Kimberly thanks for being with us thank
