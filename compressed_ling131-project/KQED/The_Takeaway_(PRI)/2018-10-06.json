and I was in the orchestra and it was early in my freshman year and I had made friends in high school but didn't really have orchestra friends yet and we were taking an orchestra trip so that was a little nerve wracking\nWhen you're a freshman disqualifies the demi crisis among bus ride to Seattle sharing a hotel room with someone you don't know\nBut there's this one girl Lindsay she and had to

coincidences when you're young teens or twenties lots of coincidences involve your grandmother you're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands coincidence is also happened to you in or near airplanes or on Craig's list\nFor many of you coincidences where the answer to your prayers are how'd you find you're missing bike\nAlso they're coincidences hidden in your name your keys you're close your address we heard\nStories about a lost roll of film discovered coincidentally in the stomach of a decomposing high enough\nAbout the man who got his favorite T shirt back from a stranger's naps ac in Slovakia about the woman who is dating not one but two mark Steven Anderson's at the same time\nBut the student whose car broke down in rush hour on a busy highway

what how how are you feeling like I'm feeling a little bit better now like me to just [noise]\nWas the only way to survive throwing up in front of a subway car full of strangers have a nice girl your age do it with you\nAnd numbers so many coincidences with numbers\nOne woman told us how she was at Thanksgiving with her extended family and I suddenly realized that six of them had the exact same number of letters in their names twenty three letters\nMichael Arthur antibody Barry Elizabeth that the Audi William Arthur ...\nThere was a guy at the mall doing surveys that test people their phone number it's obvious the guy who surveying starts to make up a number he says nine three three four five six\nWhen he'd read out that last number said eight and I tried to that bad for a second but I was cool and I said no sir I'm Sorry that's not your phone number you said well why is it that my phone number and I said because that's my phone number\nThat's my life on the phone number that you just made up is actually my phone number [noise]\nThese stories reminded me of an old Chinese saying I once heard\nActually I wanted a couple of weeks ago and I have no idea how old it is but it goes like this food shelter ... that's my friend un U. N. D. food shelter ...\nAnd what if any\nIf there is no coincidence ... story\nNo coincidence no story\nTo imply that of course life's Earl developed in ways that we can predict\nSo is it like if you heard a story with a coincidence afterwards you might be like no coincidence no story like that yes the expression you use it to quote is it like a corny thing to say mostly I think of no it won't be on this do you ever use it\nWhen the foreign aid [laughter]\nOr the risk of being corny I'm going to say in today's show no coincidence no story while the man's a way we're going to sneak these coincidence stories onto their\nAll the stories you'll hear today it first aired on our show in twenty teens and they're all verified true stories that my colleagues hid for me until the actual interview so wouldn't spoil it surprise which is also why there is so much unprofessional giggling us our\nAnd full disclosure I came into this topic a coincidence skeptic believing that a coincidence is just a coincidence nothing more [noise]\nI judged I confronted weakness I countered wide eyed faith with statistical probability and by the end well\nAct one grandma's [noise] like Oliver is living in Nicaragua right now we talked on Skype about four months ago he was on the phone to his friend Camille who goes by Kenny he mentioned her that the screen saver on his iPhone had been the same picture for a long time that he wanted to change it\nMagic and what she must have been feeling seeing that photo suddenly dislike flooded\nYeah she has a she is must I think should be really good uh poker [laughter]\n[noise] and [noise]\nSo how's mother says nothing goes home for later that night she tells her daughter this was the one this was the man who might have been she explained\nThat the reason they hadn't married was because her father how ... grandfather\nHad chosen a different has been for the man who became Helens father all of them ended up living in the\nUs that they quickly lost touch Steven didn't find out about any of this until a couple of days later\nLast one hell and you know cause I was just a actually tell you and she tells me and I was I was floored by it um and you know together will be called my mom and you know she put a good face on it she but she was you know she was pretty shocked\nDid she know that there had been this other woman that your father had in love as the thing\nMy dad told her years and years ago you know there was this other woman that I that I that I Would love with at one point but you know long before I met you but mom was like look you look past I have a pass fail a past who cares um of course you know never thinking that\nShe was going to share grandchildren with that woman I mean she later admitted to me that if she had known this from the very beginning she would have\nNot supported Helen to me um you really you know it would just been like look being with the daughter of this ... of the other woman your dad loved I mean can you find someone else [laughter]\n\nHow do you take this coincidence ... did it come to mean anything to you or to Holland\nYeah there's something about it the fact that you know I didn't have the time with my dad that I wished I had yeah and then suddenly to kind of have him be kind of an active part of my life again to think that uh I could talk to my mother in law and\nHear what he was like in his twenties something that my mom doesn't even know and you know it might actually held father is a strong believer in the idea that somehow my dad is somehow is behind all this and that somehow you know he's kind of help make all this happened [noise]\n\n\nThe time this next story takes place a guy named ... was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington heights\nSponsorship of the cake

thinking about asking her to go study and\nI get those dollars was estranged bizarre\nJust stuck in my pocket you know charcoal and went to the store I got one of those voting frames and a little piece of gold one may and I spoke to a dollar and the frame so it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold as if you know you're going to go on a church in Italy and they had a fragment from the robust some change or something like that and I call it the immaculate dollar of Arlington heights\n\n\nAnd so I'm On the friday I asked her out and she was you know all excited and we're all

at him like\nFreaked out\nShe a ton of fraud or brow a little bit and look concerned and ah I said you know it's there are some sort of problem\nI was speechless\nFor the first time ever but I said you know remind me to tell you something later I\n\nSaw it okay you know we I I let it go and uh we you know where I had a really should have got engaged and got married a couple of years later\nWe were um unpacking at a new apartment that we had an and I have the they found the the frame with the dollar in it and I stuck it up on the dresser and she came in the room I said hey I'm you never told me about this tower what's the deal with that she said well\nWhen everything teams you know as a cashier working in a copy shop in downtown Chicago and I was dating someone and I just wasn't happy with him and I just thought you know how do people know\nWho the right person that they're meant to be with\nHow do they how do they know who that is and said you know and I'm not going to worry about that I'm just gonna put my name on the dollar bill and the guy that gets his dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him and I'm like well you can't just right on your name I went actually I think it was more like maybe ten or twelve [noise]\nAnd so just dollar\nBill that you gave the I Believe in that same dollar bill that I wrote my name on and I knew that we were going to be married the data you gave me the dollar but it was pretty crazy and then you may be telling the story again\nHe asked me like five or six times and it's just the details on changes the same story like he couldn't I think he was a little bit beside himself that that\nActually happened and that I didn't tell him [noise]\n\nYou know I I I don't know how I found the well to not say anything to 'em but I just remember like do I donate to I don't do it you know what do I do\nI Know I freak this guy out and be like why does already talking about Mary wait why forget it\nYou know I don't read too much into almost anything [laughter] so I just got to move forward and then after she told me I think I went through all of the normal stages of whatever and I just but what does this mean for us are we going to\nInvent a time machine or our kids going to bring world peace or like well what's the some sort of bigger thing that we're seeing here\n[noise]\nNow just sits in that very same frame up on our address or and I look at it every day that I wake up sometimes that reminder that we have it [noise]\nWhen she's upset at me or angry\nIt's never been a question in my mind like you know and I'm going to keep this kind of the curve\nBut but I Do believe it's because of the dollar that I feel that type to them I mean obviously I Love him but I think that if it ever did cross\nMy mind I'd be like the way I this is nice told me I Can't\nJust walk out on him [noise] you know we don't we don't even wear wedding bands I'm like why it's\nJust [noise] and I'm stuck with you you got the dollar bell [laughter]\nI guess you could also you know put it back out into the register and it'd be like like I'm catching them than [laughter]\nI think it's got to go to somebody else you can do that\n[noise]\nPaul and Esther ... have been married for Nineteen years\nAgo [noise]\nForget to do [laughter] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI free rather can you spare a dime this story comes from Ryan rows are in Los Angeles\nIt happened when I was in college um I was actually pledging a fraternity and I ran into some of the like the seniors tend to um on campus and they were laughing about something\nAnd so one of them tells me the story that had happened to him that day supposedly where he gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower he hears a team\nAnd he looks down and sitting on the floor of the shower between his feet is a nickel and has no idea where this nickel came from or you know why it's there uh you know obviously like we like everyone was making jokes but you know he had changed falling out of his\nBut [laughter] you know do you where like\nWhere are you eating dollar bills or you know\n[laughter] but anyway we ever left and I I go home and I don't think much about it the next day I get in the shower and like five ten minutes into my shower I hear it and [laughter] [noise] I went down and write between my ... is a quarter\nSo my first thought was you know how did they do it like my thought was totally assumed that this must not have really happened to him that was set up and somehow they set this up that happened to me but I could not figure out how much just like you know they have to be a prank basically\nThey're teenagers they're stoned their freaked out\nTo have to tell an adult about what they've seen\nA police car happened to drive by their flag it down and the officer tells them to get in the back\nIt became clear that she was really concerned because she'd been answered yet others from our girl ... on the west side of town for the last couple of days so my God\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nIs this the beginning at funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't how many don't how many do you okay don't tell me\nI'm so she called another officer and the other officer comes there's a couple cars\nAnd they both get out and tell us to get out and say okay wait at the bottom\nSo we're waiting there you go walking into\nAnd it's dark so we can't really [noise]\n... well we can see them well enough and we don't really want to watch what's going on because we see them\nAnd I'm trying not to alert but of course I'm working\nPulled up the human figure out of the whole\nAnd then she says it's a mannequin [laughter]\nI don't know what my friends with him but I was sitting there thinking own like [noise]\nHow does this story ended up okay in a universe you know like [noise]\nUnless you say it's a male [laughter]\nJust goes to school on Monday tells a story in physics class [noise]\nAnd the kid next to him says that was us we did it\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover American by the way had been the Virgin Mary in someone's nativity scene [noise]\nI think the real coincidence is that it's like our quotes from the\nCaused this to happen or they were good friends here though [noise]\nRight right\nNo Jeff turns out that is not the real ... incidents of the story my producer Brian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both missed the point\nFriends just pointed out that I miss you and I are both MIT [laughter] even though they were growing up my own story yet I submitted it to the current events is going\nTo the main coincidences there's a girl missing at the same time\nFive words for you Dr ...\nNo coincidence no story\nHere's a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection it's the middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because one of ... line up just so\nYou can't help it you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that\nIn that way coincidences are kind of like short cuts to a very big questions about fate about God even people who don't believe in either one the notion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life\nThat there might be a plan conjured through coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young [noise] the daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time and she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nI was listening to the song that old black magic and at the end of the song LS chosen a line that old black magic that Billy Daniels got me in and I've heard her you know thing that line on that album dozens of times before and wondered his Daniels\nBut on this particular day for some reason I felt inspired to go out to the to the living room and ask my dad typically Daniels once and he explained that in the forties the Daniels had some old like magic in a way that made it his song and he was referred to as Mr Black magic I guess back in the forties and\nIt was a big deal at the time and\nI asked my dad had you met him you know did you ever nobody Daniels and he said that began you know he's probably dead now and just\nLiterally at that moment the phone rang so I answered the phone and this is playful gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley\nAnd I said who's who's calling you should begin [noise]\n[laughter]\nMeasures to stick to it [noise]\nSo last September um I was living in Roswell New Mexico and I had woken up in jail for like the last time\nThis was at a ... percent when this happened she was Twenty years old on drugs hanging out with
