made landfall in the ...\n[noise] strong strong\nHurricane Florence made landfall in the Carolinas last month and the devastation brought back painful memories from just two years earlier when Hurricane Matthew tore through the area the first category five Atlantic hurricane in nearly ten years\nFor residents of lumber to North Carolina in rural ... county the devastation was inescapable\n[noise] arch it affected your show which it affected by what they don't understand why\nIt was just deja vu for these residents the damage was just horrible\nThat's Ashley ... a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity and I talked to her about reporting in Lumberton and whether or not residents stories were reflected in the ... the economic picture touted by the Trump Administration lumber\nTen North Carolina it's a it's one of the most diverse rural counties in the country actually um you have about a third white a third black third lumpy Native American and a growing Hispanic population so it it's a very interesting kind of make up there\nAnd of course we're looking at this series through the sort of idea that the president of the United states has recently and said that we solved the war on poverty that were good when it comes to poverty but Lumberton is actually one of the poorest and on healthiest and most dangerous counties in North Carolina tell us about what that looks like\nYeah so I visited twice or the summer and this fall first to kind of see what the town looked like after being hit by Hurricane Matthew twenty sixteen and you could still see a lot of the destruction from that long ago you would see\nPiles of sand that had come from under the river that people hadn't cleared out I'm Still some furniture laying out some houses that just were\nVery dilapidated and some areas where they had already torn down the entire house and there was just a green space\nAnd what about the impact of Hurricane Florence\nYeah so they got pummeled again I'm almost two years to the day um which\nWas just horrible because when I was there in July you would still see all this destruction but I was talking to a lot of people who are finally getting their lives back together um one woman I saw her the day that she got into her new home that was just rebuilt\nAnd then Florence head and the same thing happened all over again her houses was flooded and I heard that story time and time again\nAnd are there any people or groups in particular that these residents would like to see more from I'm Wondering about FEMA um or any other organizations the\nMissed out on the ground Red Cross has been on the ground there was an issue with Hurricane Matthew with HUD money with housing and urban development money that hadn't come through from the state\nI think about ten percent of the money that was gifted from the federal government was actually distributed so people are saying well okay the money hasn't calm that time around than in next year's leaders what's going to happen with Hurricane Florence money um how would I was not going to work\nSo Chris Howard the lumberjack resident we heard from earlier echoed those same concerns and trying to get help rebuilding his house\nAbout it but\nNow it just getting medication stage [noise] we don't know what was going to tell me that\n[noise] for Eric rich default match\nI talked to many residents that one either word to discourage to even apply for aid because they were told that they would never get it denials are very frequent FEMA admits that and they say you just have to apply again that that's really discouraging to residents\nOne person that I spend a lot of time with understand Powell she actually went back and forth with FEMA twelve different times talking to different\nRepresentatives having to tell her story again hearing conflicting things\nYou need this piece of information you need this to the point where she just gave up on that process so the recovery for a lot of people that need it the most that were really hit badly and are in shelters are staying with family members the system isn't really working from them and the way that it's meant to\nThis is a district that was reliably democratic but did end up voting for President Trump who has said as we mentioned earlier that the war on poverty has over is that a disconnect for the residents of Lumberton will\nSo at the time it was very interesting I\nAs I said before just showing up matters and during the hurricane a lot of the people I talked to said we saw Donald Trump's boss we saw the big name Trump on the side of the box and sell Lara Trump passing out water bottles to us and that was really memorable and we didn't see Hillary Clinton\nDonald Trump also was kind of talking to the points that really resonated with Robin ... such as I'm going to get rid of NAFTA or a lot of people say took a ton of the manufacturing jobs out of the county um I'm not sure\nHow much they think that he's held up their promises but at the time he seemed to be speaking right to them\nAnd where does lumber to go from here obviously there are mid term elections coming up in a couple of weeks you know there's probably still a lot more recovery to be done where do they go from here\nYeah so that's something I was trying to piece together when I was there because you still have hundreds of people in shelters I'm and maybe voting is the last thing on their minds are they weren't really politically engaged to begin with\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live

registration deadline for one third of the states across the country from Arizona to Georgia to Illinois and beyond if you want to vote this November this is your reminder to please go register\nAnd leading up to election day we've heard a lot about election meddling whether by Russia China some guy in a basement or otherwise but what's not been in the media spotlight is ensuring fair access to the polls for everyone in the United states who wants to cast a ballot\nHurdles for voters are now getting thrown up across the country\nJust this year the American civil liberties union filed a federal lawsuit against Arizona saying the state put more than five hundred thousand voters\nAt risk of being disenfranchised and in June a federal judge struck down a Kansas law that required proof of citizenship to register to vote it was deemed a violation of the national voter registration act\nJessica who's minutes here to tell us more she's a reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for election land a coalition of news rooms covering problems with voting and twenty Eighteen Jessica thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me I appreciate it help us understand what's happening here we know that since twenty sixteen there've been a couple of changes as we mentioned at the top\nWho are affecting really voter disenfranchisement who can and can't vote in this country what some of those changes that so there\nAre a lot of states that have issued new voter ID laws or there are states that have redrawn they're voting boundaries um to make it more difficult for your voice to be heard um in terms of gerrymandering and making\nDistricts far more partisan and they once were and this is sort of been a slow progression states have also a become a little bit more\nUm bowls in terms of um cleaning the voter rolls and sometimes that\nIs sometimes that crosses the line into purging um and and so there there have been a lot of action so especially in the last two years to make these things happen so there's going to be in this election it's going to be the first time that a lot of these laws are in place and are expecting at least a little bit of confusion at the polls\nLet's talk about that because um we talked a little bit about you know cleaning and purging what's the difference there between cleaning the voter rolls and purging the voter rolls I think there are lots of civil rights activists who say this is really an effort to purge and keep communities of color and other folks off of the voter rolls what are you seeing\nYou know I think that it really depends on who you ask I think I'm there I think there's no election administrator red and yellow purple green that would tell you that that voter roll maintenance is bad I think we all have an interest in making sure that people who are no longer\nLiving in our communities or who are no longer eligible to vote for whatever reason remain on the voter roll 'em but there are states that do this and in a in a particularly aggressive way that might make it more likely that a person who [noise]\nAnd said doesn't check their mail very frequently or wouldn't know to respond to it'd be a specific male or or doesn't vote regularly would be more likely to be purged from the voter roll 'em so for example the Houston case which the Supreme Court decided just recently\nAllowed the state of Ohio to remove people from the rule if they didn't respond to a few mailers and also didn't vote in and I think two elections and so if you think about the people who are least likely to respond to a postcard that looks very much like junk mail or for being honest and then also not regularly turn out to vote\n'em those might be people who\nAre minorities or the poor or the elderly who are least likely to vote any way and so they might be at higher risk for getting person from the rolls that it really depends on who you ask how severe they believe that problem as if you talk to someone like the Brennan Center they're going to tell you that it's a crisis have you talked to someone like the public interest legal foundation they're going to tell you it's good\nPractice practice but I Want to push back a little bit there because when I get a notice for jury duty and clear what that noticed is I don't think anybody Mrs noticed is that why aren't these notices clear or are they seem somewhat deceptive if you're taking people off the rules and not making it clear that you've done that I mean doesn't isn't that somewhat anti them democratic it's I think\nThat um that that's not necessarily the case in a lot of states there the mailers I agree could be a lot clearer and but they do send the mailers more than one time over a period of a couple of years I'm\nAn ... that said though people are very likely to ignore them even if they get them a couple of times like I'm not sure that I Would take a look at a postcard and realize that the cat that consequence for not responding to it\nThat I may be removed from the voter roll or perhaps\nIf the language was huge big bold letters and that is when you get a jury summons and it clearly says if you don't show up you're gay rested I Want to turn around for a second here because what happens at that that just when he's sixteen election there were and I covered this there were lots of threats at the polls I'm worried that the fear of people being threatened when they showed up at the polls\nUm peoples claiming to sort of want to implement these checks and balances when they got there are you seeing that for the midterms is there are there is that that many levels of concern in terms of who can and can't vote you mentioned confusion at the polls wasn't that going to look like\nI think that's what we're more likely to see and this was the case as well and she's got some sixteen\nI'm we anticipate it ahead of the two thousand and sixteen election um a lot of voter intimidation that was on the news every day there were people actually actively making threats and not intimidating voters at the poll and are costing them there that didn't actually happen um in two thousand sixteen we only saw that a couple of very isolated locations and not for very long and it didn't appear to be\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream by essay Jim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November for that the patron or freedom theater at the gym at ... dot com\nWary of the idea that someone's going to scream at them in front of their polling location that is actually not a threat that we have seen and but the talk of that threat\nIn any exaggerating its likelihood would prevent some people from turning out to the polls I really want to stress\nThat we did not see that in twenty sixteen and we don't necessarily expect to see that in twenty eight team what we did see twenty sixteen and what we do anticipate staying in twenty six twenty Eighteen is confusion around new laws so for example and twenty six team to Texas voter id law was implemented\nUm and it wasn't even necessarily that the law itself disenfranchised people but because there were so confusion about what the law actually say that\nBack it's like when you said they didn't actually disenfranchised people the voter id doesn't a voter id require you to have an ID and a lot of people don't have\nThe right it does but in Jackson twenty sixteen there was a reasonable impediment declaration even fill out\nAnd that was not appropriately implemented across the state and so that and the the ... information in terms of what voters expected and what poll workers are trained to do disenfranchised quite a lot of people and so we expect to see the same sort of confusion and twenty eight feet around new laws\nJessica who's been as a reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for election land Jessica thank you so much for joining us
