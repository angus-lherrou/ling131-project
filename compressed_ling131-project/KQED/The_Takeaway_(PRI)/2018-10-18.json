in Boston the Houston Astros Irvine\nGBH radio in Boston [noise]\nThe Houston Astros are vying for a chance to win back to back World Series titles [noise]\nPitcher revert rose to not may have lost a master's fans when he gave up that home run during Tuesday's game the Astros are currently down three to one against the Boston Red Sox in the American league championship series\nBut as soon as place on the team has also been questioned for reasons unrelated to his pitching since he joined the Astros last August in June major league baseball suspended as soon as Seventy five games for violating the league's domestic violence policy\nAnd while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in the trade from the Toronto blue jays than the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area Whitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney\nAbsolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public right now about the OSU nah a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case then a police report was filed but because it was in Canada\nOr things are just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably know some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended and eventually just about a over a month ago\nThe criminal case with wrapped up with a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a you know restraining order situation in the U.S he has a year of\nProbation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico did not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of connection um so that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh yeah the the details are just a little\nFuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way let's talk a little bit about ... a\nCurrent domestic violence policy like what is that it's only been around for a couple of years um but it's led to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna\n[noise] yes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen I'm there have been a handful of investigations and suspensions to this point and no sooner was the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant a suspension it was the third or fourth one this year actually\nI'm most recently apps and Russell of the cubs was suspended forty games\nFor a domestic abuse so uh they're having players offended before and after you know he was not the first but again his situation is very specific because there was a trade that was involved um but MLD doesn't necessarily um similar to other sports and if they do not necessarily\nWait until a criminal case have been completed they do their own investigation they speak to victims on their own times they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account um an overall the processed it a little bit\nA kind of like ... case it's a little bit um [noise] non transparent we don't have a ton of information about why you know it was Seventy five games out of Russell was forty a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past two years we don't really know what I'm obese investigation\n... um so it's a little tough and it does make it uh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in syndication you're saying\nHe's the third highest number of games he must have done something awful\nBut we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky um and players under the suspended under the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players suspended for steroids or performance enhancing drugs which are\nNot eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a tricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms there are some issues of print parents see as far as how their investigations go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think on a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as I'd like it to\nThe Astros decided to trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I guess the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there are people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that it was soon actually makes the teen stronger what do you make\nOf that yeah I think it's a the way I've seen it the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs\nDid this with our oldest Chapman a stark closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago and it did win the world series and it worked and sand kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it widow sooner I'm ... been a little bit more blatant about that what we're doing um you know he ... he throws good pitches he's gonna win could when it's World Series\nWhen ... what's interesting about this story is that the arrows now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that purely for the optics of\nHaving gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR spin Jim ...

alliance that I think is um an allied a very intimately with Israel with strong support from the Trump Administration um I think these players are hoping to rewrite the geopolitics and\nThe political map if the middle east by pursuing a series of very aggressive policies toward their adversaries fundamentally rooted in strengthening authoritarian\nUh allies in the region a crushing civil societies and um and and playing very hardball with um with other countries in the region\nDo you expect that all of these things could potentially lead to another uprising similar to what we saw in the Arab

assuming that people will be too tired or two I'm disillusioned to resist and revolt of course with revolutions that revolts we never can predict when do happen but almost certain\nUh another ... to some form is inevitable\nWell and I well also you know the Arab Spring was in twenty ten twenty eleven were now in a very different moment um at least internationally the United states has a different president in a different administration I'm Wondering\nUm what about that long standing relationship and support that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had\nA this isn't a Trump phenomenon solely this is something that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had for for quite some time do you think that uh that relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United states could be affected by what we're seeing right now in the ground\n[noise] well I think it's bound to be affected I mean you're absolutely right to um\nTo suggest that this is simply not to be diminished Donald Trump the U.S Saudi relationship and more broadly the U.S relationship to the region goes back to World War two where the United states effectively I'm struck up a series of alliances with 'em\nOr autocrats that authoritarian regimes I'm hoping that they would preserve stability advance American interest\nIn this particular incident that we're talking about what ...\nThe United states and specifically President Trump has sort of played two sides of this coin on the one hand they're defending the Saudis they're saying they're regional partner on the other hand they're being confronted with more and more and more evidence just yesterday we heard there was an audio recording of\nA what could potentially be ... um last moments um then that evidence is showing that this could in fact be a state sanctioned Saudi murder what type of danger could there be in continuing that alliance given this increasing evidence\n[noise] well the danger is that it simply going to um um perpetuate a very\nUm [noise] I'm odious regime in Riyadh that is responsible for a lot of the regional instability so I think the danger here is that it's simply going to deepen the instability in the region it's going to generate more anti American hostility it's going to embolden\nAutocrats and dictators around the world to see that at least this administration in Washington DC\nIs willing to go to bat apologize
