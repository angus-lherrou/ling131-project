science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the typical ... plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nThink about bees or an aunt and spiders tiny as they are in their own vital parts of our ecosystem weather as food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior think about the term hides mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful in Kenya individual behavior still took the hand of faith for the whole group\nThe hives indeed legion my next guest looked at these questions how his word is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumble bee and know a pitcher woman is an associate professor at UCLA looking at these social behavior of bees ants and even spider [noise]\n\n... what did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you the honeybees get all the attention right now but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nThat my did my PHD in a honeybee labs and then I went ... and worked on bumblebees instead a third of a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequence and when it with the Clintons we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions in honeybees until I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them and\nBees and and even spider [noise]\n\nCertain order to know if you ask everybody you built tell you the honeybees get all the attention right there but but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nActually did my PHD in a honeybee labs are but I went rogue and worked on bumblebees instead I started a PHD in two thousand six which is the year that the honeybee genome sequence and when it was sequenced we suddenly had this tool kit that we could use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I sort of fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to honey bees bumblebees have a very different like All right out of the colonies gets started\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social uh there's never a point in their lives in the life of the honeybee queen where she's living on her own\nBut bumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and he's queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot and start their own asked for their spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens\nAnd workers and just sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nAnywhere brought an show us with the ...\nI did yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nah it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bomb will be used to actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these ... groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest the way that they live\nAbout ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees are having equals lifestyles all the time really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and swings my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focus and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals and economy contribute to forging ... at home\nYou're brought from ... which are ... Jarvis\nHarvest giants from I'm here in California for extra pressure on the sidewalk ... slightly larger than what you are a little bit longer there but yeah and their lives 'cause she than the ones you see on the sidewalk there were why are you interested in the\nCity they him the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between nest sites\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they worried and how quickly they called her friends to food so another thing I brought here as a cast often asked to flip it over I was on its head\nAlso would hang looks like that that sort of cast of an estimate yes use like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly fast their players from Home Depot how far does not go down as just the whole life and you know that's just the top part\nAbout six or eight inches long and it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can for down other materials we did win cast ... um which is a ... metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and it won't break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how deep they can go\nOn your house there's so much focus on queen bumblebees wonder about the drone and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones ... the drones don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething that ... when I was reading about this and that was really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or for what something called royal jelly but that's not what the formal beach do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees\nAnd there's a some point during really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in regard to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just haven't looked for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from the audience for it started right over there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom\nIs allergic to me I was wondering if there is any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal hurling\nAid from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal her when she gets styles that is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack up for a certain you work with food and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies um that's really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the\nTerrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were stung by being me too\nI'm does a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the beef and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the venom and it'd be interesting\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question but no longer answer also live in big groups were the queen Howard their lives different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of ... and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground raised bees will and\nPut their hives inside of fame three cavities and so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example those honeybees in some species of fans will relocate from one site to another is so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site in ... the way the shape of the entrance of the cavity did\nThey find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ends will off there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances in dark places or there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have ... counties that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands in even up to ... million so the leaf cutter\n... can be I have two million individuals\nJust been trying for Halloween I Know that you also

time on the PBS NewsHour [noise]\nStay with us we'll bring you the PBS NewsHour this afternoon at three here on cake you eat a public radio [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nHow did you sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience that district's about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole should bang\nBut it is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work my next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week\nAnd he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles\n\nIs that right you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is\nYes for um the majority of long term studies\nThat have looked have found that if you get significantly less or significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night then that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah 'cause I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that's not\nWell not to get back in ... in all honesty I'm In the six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first star where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just made me up with the kids not get enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do\nThose tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis not getting enough sleep\nThan their health consequences\nI'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nAnd I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what about sleep\nWhat our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the quality what what is one of the genes ...\nThat's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes in their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works\nI'm from a kind of a lot of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nUm be a time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day recently most of the night or what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restore the properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus and\nThe things about sleep that improve your health the genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nThey're well they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressing the brand they're expressed in the body\nThe gene that I focused on in my most recent study it'd be more one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which\nWe have had a lasso ... one is what's known as the clock Jane your clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as a clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism lights\nHas to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears talk to my students about gears on the clock most of them don't lower collectors are [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep so we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain\nHow to sleep more importantly\nHow to recover from sleep loss and he wouldn't even have to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it's kind of works like a thermostat is set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes to low turn the heat on your terms that are the hit on the goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep processes works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more you get too much sleep it will go on to the other direction\nThe clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the home you're stabbing mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from you know so when you say the clock is\nThat the the circadian rhythm we've\nBeen talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism in what isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours\nQuestion over here yeah I had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're\nSpeaking of in the south so napping is a is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself or do I agree one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap in my office in the afternoon\nNo one can complain you can write at all I Know what I'm doing research [laughter] but you're saying napping is important is the thing is very important if you're not getting daily suspiciously\nAnd most of us to have children or have jobs I live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not than getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but I think from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much and that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanisms\nUm especially those of us that get sleepy or in the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either directly right that's why I don't try I understand\nBut that's just me
