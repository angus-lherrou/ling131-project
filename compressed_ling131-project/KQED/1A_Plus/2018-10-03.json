H. M. U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other sciences or played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that first showed up on the battlefield was a symmetric weapon that would've been a symmetric in the military says where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call it an symmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a master minded sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of which scientists engineer and an artist\nBut moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the terrorists you know would make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they're you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist my weapon I is anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly suited mountaintops and wait for photons too arrived from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days are strong numbers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and because Germany of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world about ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky and to to know the night sky\nAnd on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky looks different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control\nIt I should know we didn't have a conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one aid you can find that conversation on line at the one eight doc Ford\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space of I guess it will be a ...\nTheory to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth ... since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of what effect it within their who is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people and humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space forces not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the U. S. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets\nSo there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation or commerce\nYou order something from Amazon is on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're\nRight or at least to the nearest airport [laughter] step doorstep delivery by airborne craft is still to come but\nWe were called them drones I guess [laughter] but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well might we separate the concerns of the air with their concerns or space because these are the same companies aerospace companies that that became a word right\nAnd if you separated it out in the military you would then sort of\nTidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete with in under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general and the air force then and now controls space activities or the military\nIt's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where as separate from what's already happening so I wasn't there to second guess general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today are the Trump announcement as well as the ... pants follow on announcement\nOr if you just listened to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella and if you're going to do that\nUh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense I why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could render us all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that as a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survival ability right of\nOf of the body odor that requires the sunlight to feed it so so a space for us would might include ... by the way I Would also throw in on your clean up the debris it's up there while you're yes\nThe space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace is very hard and not particularly strategic to make space and the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate the treaty to which we are signature and today more than a hundred countries or sign\n\n\nSupport for NPR chemist from this station and from

right now tomorrow's conversation deals with the long history of anger expressed by women in America and what it's meant for the country\nWhat's your story has there been times when you chose not to

through in the time that we have left Eli wrote on our Facebook page that she's a big fan of yours Eli writes\nI have a job interview at Goddard today God of space flight center do you have any suggestions on how I can slam dunk this thing it's my dream to be able to work at NASA\n[laughter] [noise] I think in this time in the world of of\nExploring the frontier or not only a strong resume matters but uh inter personally enthusiasm ... I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and your your\nYour spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure that we're all for taking him and the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body transplanting a human consciousness into a computer [noise]\nAh so first of the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing\nTo put a human brain into a robotic chassis um when you could program the robot attracts you to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put to to put our consciousness Elizabeth that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it there's evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three books\nWe got grass [laughter] we're not still writing books on its alone if this law obey gravity suck so um but it it sort of applauding all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of transplanting brain you know what I really want is if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a or less\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of I'm I'm not sorry the brain of an less patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nThat this sounds very altered carbon even lost a lot of Netflix I was very Frank I'm starting to really I I just said\nIf you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant a brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly hope so is on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is there's there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze what it really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nBut you haven't looked the arts so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who study the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\n[noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous than asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger there's the easier it is to detect\nSo so ah I I Wish they were good about that it's possible that a comet could come from out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but it I regardless you want a healthy space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding protecting have any insurance plan ... that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating saying that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nOver nature and heed the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what do your over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forbearers and I kind of skill today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they asked\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil in green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to\nThis is this I cannot tolerate any further only eat people I don't want to eat people are so rich that really is too hot [laughter] [noise] right\nSo you so you so we have restoring forces in the world that prevent swing too\nIn the world that prevent swing too low in in this regard and these this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back\nSocieties bounce back ... people in power bounce back\nSo how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back in ... so that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop\nYou think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe if not what's the timeline to solving say something like dark matter\nTo question Jared ... so I\nThink about that all the time I lose sleep on whether or slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough to actually understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask and this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent way do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so uh now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders of those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did\nSo in a way we're assembling wrong by wrong a ladder of knowledge that looks over every next wall that we have confronted and so we do it so maybe the sum of all the intelligence of all humans", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "03"}
