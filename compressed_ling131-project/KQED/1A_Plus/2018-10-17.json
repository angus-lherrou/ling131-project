ah your earlier guest commented on it which is we don't do enough to educate on it you know my my uh girls in school now\nAnd they don't have a standard course in the public school system on basic cyber cyber security and unfortunately you need it right now uh it's not a safe space and part of learning how to make it safe is\nEducating people both at the consumer level in one of the things I talk about it in the books even that are most sophisticated institution so let's say MIT\nLearning cyber security I'm like how to code was not part of the basic curriculum that even at the highest levels people weren't thinking about this day to day I Hope that there's time for change and that it doesn't depend on just your behavior or Joshua which is\nYou know when I grew up in New York in the eighties\nThe ah it used to be if you made eye contact with someone uh you know if you didn't cross the street when you saw someone than it was your fault if she got stabbed there's a famous Saturday Night live skit it's like what did you make eye contact and what do you expect to get out that that's kind of today on the Internet right like if you don't change your\nAlpha new Merrick ah thirty character\nPassword every thirty days for the twenty five different accounts you have that it's your fault as a consumer I don't think we're ever going to get out of it if that's our mindset well we need to do is focus ON Technology\nThat makes it easier for consumers to use and also recognize there's maybe some stuff we just shouldn't be doing using a protocol that's fundamentally not secure\nI Do think that we are having a slightly more sophisticated conversation these days I mean even that meeting the county west had with President Trump in the oval office there was a shot of him sitting at the resolute desk opening his phone and his password was zero zero zero zero zero which for those replaying the home game and\nHe was a really bad password to we pick apart what you're referring to as the code war you see that it bears some resemblance to the Cold War in what ways\nI think we're in for a generational struggle and that that struggle is going to include not just the use of force but this setting a whose values prevail who's norms prevail about the world that we want to live in\nAnd then you need to execute on those values with your tactics so ... do deterrent bring criminal cases make public behavior that you think is unacceptable like\nThe Russian uh malware not pat ya that indiscriminately hit companies around the world like Maersk shipping\nFedEx hospitals and took them off line I think we can partner with countries that share our values around the world\nWorked together to collectively impose a cost on a rogue actor like Russia when they do that type of activity to say this is unacceptable it's not going to change overnight though just like the Cold War\nIt's going to take years and years and years of day in day out fighting and this war has already been done in part of what I was telling stories that we didn't used to tell that we kept secret inside government but now we're trying to make public I think importantly so that consumers so that companies\nCan ... ah realize that were already in this conflict and start taking steps to be a part of it\nYou quote your old boss early in the book here's part of what Bob Mueller said in his speech you worked on back in two thousand seven it's a fairly long quote but I Want to read it in its entirety here's part of what Bob Mueller said at the time quote\nThere was an old saying that all roads lead to roam in the days of the Roman empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end the same roads lead to Rome's downfall for they allowed the invaders to march right up to the city's gates he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and information new sights and sounds new people and places but the invaders\nThose whose intent is not enlightenment but exploitation and extremism are marching right down those same roads to attack us in multiple ways unquote is this another Roman moment so we kind of becoming a victim of our openness\n... I think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech where out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area\nIt was the first major speech on cyber as a national security threat think about that it's now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major officials to be the top threat and it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica vicar from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... division exploit social media\nIn order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case um that I talk about that still I think people haven't heard about\nOf it as a case it looks from the perspective of a company like someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't\nIn day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks he also through bitcoin I also on the back end had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen name due date Hussein he became friends with him only through Twitter only on line\nAnd what he did with that stolen customer information that was provided to was turn it into a kill list that said using this customer information\nAre located from his safe hole and Rocca ah Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of his stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live\nThat's a new era of national security that that we're in we're criminal threats merge or blend with terrorists and national security threats and companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMichelle emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world that function before the digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience\nI Wonder John if Michelle has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShell definitely in fact one of the cases we talked about is an Internet a bank heist a worry hackers managed to send human operatives to ATM machines all across the world in different countries and they used a hack\nSatirized Hollywood

radio quality audio file using our app won a vox pop\nWill speak to the layman and share some of your stories tomorrow on one day we've been talking about the threat\nFrom cyber attacks and we know that some hackers are hell bent on stealing our secrets so now might be a good time to go check your Facebook account the most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you love right in without having type your password every time\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at and personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown\nYour birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or\nTrying to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connecting people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions as new post every day I see the first one we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might pilot our policy so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove the terror propaganda that we've removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags for us\nNow once content has been flat as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nA and making a decision if it violates the policy and never made it if it doesn't violate the policy that that's\nGot to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area the person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise we have a really global population using his service in fact more than eighty five percent\nOf people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak a different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have\nNative language speakers because they really understand the way that language is eating so that's a big focus and are hiring once you're hired as a controversy or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in wind so for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might open\nAll about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm effect of self harm when\nYou catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook and violated the terms\nWhat's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing to say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with us\nWe still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the site that said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it's harder\nAreas where it's working really well with terror propaganda I'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can flags in vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery\nOr terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at a time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very can textual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to contact patterns\nHow's that pattern recognition work where we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on\nActors themselves for instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we will remove your account even if you're not otherwise violent in our content policies we also have policies against\nTerror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance want it to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's representing al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through your review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you were a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use your if you just have one comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lie or copy and then there's other options I mean does other options there's an option to report somebody I Wonder\nHow much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world as learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive\nI think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it and because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time to have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people how his Facebook teaching people to use Facebook", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
