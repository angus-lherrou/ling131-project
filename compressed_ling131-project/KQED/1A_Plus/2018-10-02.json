explore trends in gun legislation and proposals around the nation today also marks one year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas at an open air country music festival it left fifty eight people dead and hundreds of people wounded\nAfter that shooting many people called for more gun control measures particularly on bump stocks some states passed bump stock restrictions other major restrictions went nowhere\nBut this year some things shifted after another mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida a gunman walked into that school and killed Seventeen students and staff\nThat sparked a movement led by students survivors and states around the nation started restricting gun access including some states with Republican governors\nJoining us in Studio to

overview of what's been going on as I understand that there are about fifty new laws restricting gun access that move forward including and fourteen states that have Republican governors right\nThat's right and uh we tracked this since um the shooting in Parkland, Florida a last February because uh it what we found and this is really interesting was that up until Parkland even with uh the many other mass shootings unfortunately that have taken place\nA that for the most part states reacted by expanding gun rights I'm up until Parkland Parkland seems to have shifted something or perhaps a because the students there um\nBecame so politically active it's so outspoken a so quickly or that following that um [noise] incident it seems that ah states have moved from the other day\nAnd then at

speaking to Scott Greenberger executive editor of state line Chris Brown the co president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence and Richard Feldman president of the independent firearm owners association\nWe love to hear from you to share what you know about new gun laws in your state or proposals in your state whether they are in the state house or on the ballot\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a X. W. A. M. U. dot org Richard by the way before we keep going we mentioned that you are a former lobbyist for the call ray you're not president of a group called the independent firearm owners association\nFor those who may not have heard of it that's that's a separate organization from an IRA right or is it affiliated or is there any relationship now just clarify\nNo relationship between the two I headed up the firearm industry's trade association during the Nineteen nineties\nGotcha okay they just wanted to make sure we're kind of clear on on the the distinction between your organization and the and the n._r._a. Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we could talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag mall Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats get an array of ways so this is an unprecedented in terms of\nGetting vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of defeat them\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm at the Jerry Brown has a governed as say a pragmatic a\nLiberal and progressive and so um [noise] uh you know in this case he felt like it at perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh\nIt went a little too too far um and a return out it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland has focused on a these so called red flag laws or I'm a limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers you know the argument the inner aids argument for for such a long time was that a guns\nDon't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties or people who are in favor of more um\nUh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view is their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more a controlled and safeguards speaking\nOf the end are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in this February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and people with criminal background\nThat's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation\nIn general for this policy would allow family members for\nLaw enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by judge which were prohibited individual from having any firearms or ammunition [noise] if the judge has clear evidence that the family member photos and immediate and present danger\nUm of causing injury to themselves or daughters\nIndividuals with a mental illness should not have access to fire on various\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Marilyn worth noting that his a minus rating from the n._r._a. dropped to a seat as a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder\nAs a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact you think that that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan\nActually there is a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact on his NRA rating it has an impact on that rating that Brady Gibson as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that have been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately or the you know the second Amendment rights says of gun owners\nWest at the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job is getting polling data back and focus group information that really appealed to different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll as\nWell most people think I have not been shot yet and and that is a very concerning thank the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions say certainly applaud governor Hogan forgiving the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nI hear you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont has a good example of that I mean Vermont was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April Vermont governor Phil Scott who's a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nNobody's got said he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled and alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house he was being heckled by opponents to gun restrictions listen\nI support the second amendment [noise] [noise]\nAre we doing everything we can make our kids in our community safe\n[noise]\nIt got a point where our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put that on a\nBus [noise] or police don't have the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in to prevent a loved one taking their life [noise] and [noise]\nPart of the signing ceremony on the steps of the Vermont state house with Vermont governor Phil Scott who is a Republican Richard Feldman filled in what you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country\nI think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is\nSomehow cornered itself by its own success on the politics\nOf this issue transcends the policy of this issue and therein lies so much of the problem in getting this today focused in a way that we can achieve\nResults that work for everyone and we can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy\nWe really have to well wind those two and dealing with the perceptions versus the realities in this society it's highly unlikely that anyone you or I Know directly is going to be shot it's his ... testicle thing but of course it's gonna make news and\nAnd so it's up to them whether they the given all over

laws that we should touch on before our time is up\nWe should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WFL our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that you had an Eighteen year old a who did purchase this weapon I think I think without that particular fact he probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom are gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what do you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being afraid of the\nWorld particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in them off so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military\nSociety has already said that you're trained in can carry a firearm so this bill would not unfair that even at those ages that\nState rep host the ... in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYeah than our as challenging it end quote I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for a\nAnd R I for a long time um had as ... filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing I think that it will certainly less than judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and the app held\nAnd I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe\nOf Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will know that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age than one\nAll of which were a really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw a from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in a home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package fills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me as it passed in the state of Florida rat has long been one of the\nStrongest a sort of an incubator of the ... legislative agenda and I think it's very telling\nOn obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism that took place and media at Lee following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to safe storage in a moment but the ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which a state representative who joined us showed us one of these safe storage lockers that does open\nWith your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find that conversation online at our website the one a dot org before we move on to other kinds\nOf gun legislation Richard Feldman could I just get your sense in terms of\nThe ... real view\nGun legislation the it already has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level or we just shooting ourselves here should we just\nCome out and just see the IRA is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more\n... and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first of all it's to find something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a. I'm an endowment number the n._r._a. there five million NRA members um there's the board of directors that is the senior leadership\nThere that can psalms there are many and raise\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA and we'll show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nAs so many will myself included um but I I think we're talking about the senior leadership of an already here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner\nOf if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate\nThat ah when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutionally has to be against it because of the terminology in the political position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean what we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times\nBut you know what I mean talking about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big ... the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... the you know liberties last safe place that NRA that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics that's galvanizing the true believers\nThat's about membership that's about fundraising that's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues in America\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in\nIt that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in a firearm debate than others but we've been put on that side Scott Y. disorder sides I wanted to ah just ah\nTo to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where\nState legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a [noise]\nUm the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm a there is another outlet in many states and that's about an issue of Washington state will have a ballot initiative a November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive a similar measure came close to getting down on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with the marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nLet me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about state gun legislation in Missouri from a person who was working for a democratic state reps office this is what she lifted our inbox\nThis is Emily Laughlin calling from Missouri state representative Tracy me curries office in two thousand sixteen Missouri has house sells six fifty six eliminating all permanent requirements for concealing Kerry and the state of Missouri leaving a loophole that allows domestic abusers to possess firearms\nSince two thousand sixteen there's been a bipartisan effort to close that loophole\nLeadership and the Missouri legislator will not new spell or make it a priority to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers instead during the past session we spend our committee time focusing on bills that expand\nGun rights like house don't Nineteen thirty six known as the guns everywhere bell that little lemonade almost all of the state's gun free zones things for your doing on money", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
