V. O. M. radio back in July is part of what means governors said\nOr one thing I Know there's no way they can force me to put state in red ink and I will not do that so I can tell I mean I go to jail before

telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet or I mean how's this going to ask well\nA polar page is he was

micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nDo it then we're going to be going to jail that's part of Maine Governor polar pave speaking back in July and I read ... telling\nVoters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet or I mean how's this going to ask well\nA ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidate in a one two races that are are he probably shouldn't have won in the political sending that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that that's what voters elected in foreign\nUh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters I'm In the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point Paula pages turn out this year uh the Democratic candidate is leading and in most of the surveys that ah that that up there um but it it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have\nThe health care that they that they need it and this is a it's a problem in Maine especially in a communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast\nOr is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs and uh you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the if you pay the retail price of the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that they might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would've been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for their democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with their with their pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because\nOf that is consistently one of the big complaint so we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis as how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like\nThis will be these gag clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of the low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug prices issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nYeah that that will be less federal legislation on the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gang clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the no the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices that and uh\nObviously based in the navy you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices have different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to a school the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have a lot of people didn't want to have that\nBut now we have it then it's going to really drive prices\nScott back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws in the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is in is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a\nPrice increase these increases beyond a certain point in the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reverse in some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill or in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five\nMore states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all past\nStates um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program\nTo exclude some drugs from the a formula that the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all\nFDA approved drugs in their formula or the idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make our understand the argument from Massachusetts would they were trying to do anything for the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now run out for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts and you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive\nI'm Jeremy ... and after Pete Souza left his job as White House photographer for President Obama he became a star on Instagram using photos of a bomb that to comment on the Trump

our app won a vox pop or series the state we're in continues next Monday on one day back now to our conversation\nWith read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a ass W. A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from Muncie law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible\nWell of course the people who have an employer plans for the hijacked or our big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles enough to pay before your insurance kicks and there are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to basically filling with employer insurance but generally Medicaid has sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe weighty Affordable Care act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get\n'em medicate people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big ... so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plants and they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere to eat sidebar for just a second let me to the point of this series this is talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned what simple set of health care costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and there needs to be for ...\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going\nJulie actually it's where it's going it's back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes\nThat the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states scale do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of the\nThe junior partner to the state um but it had gotten so stretched it a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act with trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that just means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding that it is taking us back to where we were beforehand\nWell as Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again California Massachusetts states like that\nThey're re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example ah on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they are joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nTell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and it's the it's kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalized for recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states or not and the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into ...\nThis way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas overtime\nOr yeah and it's not just the medical that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota a myth no for legal legal for racial noted for in in on the medical side there\nAre three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved at this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate\nOr it came up and you know in Florida last year and last year two years ago um but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of\nA marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak a they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is of mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement uh ability and and the the fact that not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will have don't have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there are three items in Missouri\nSo they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual the citizen groups that that put them on the ballot those are amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which I if I'm wrong I think the proposition goes on about from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine uh the people who are setting up\nA ... who get to write these laws\nAlso essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of pie you can find that on line at the one a dot org\n... a couple of things to add to what to read set on this very interesting issue um at one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people",
