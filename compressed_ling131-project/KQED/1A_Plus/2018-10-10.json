on Michael Krasny lie for Luther Burbank center in Santa Rosa with a live audience [noise]\nTwenty four people died in last year's massive fires thousands more had to flee their homes and\nHad little or no warning from officials were able to pedals this morning and the second hour former city state and county officials\nTo talk about the lessons learned from the fire and whether we are more prepared now for disasters but first we're joined by ... a reporter Suki Lewis she was part of the kick you eat investigative team that examines thousands of\nNine one one calls and dispatched tape from the Knight the fire started to figure out what went wrong and I want to warn people you may have things trigger here and there there's been a lot of problems with ... students who just to cover you out on that score and welcome Suki\nThank you what did you learn from listening to the to\nUm well we learned we got this kind of picture of the way the night unfolded um and that really showed\nPainted a picture of these cascading challenges that started with this incredible wind event that happened and the the red flag warning everyone kind of heard that but I think a lot of times you get red red flag warning but you're not really sure what does that mean for me as an individual\nAnd so the trees are blowing around they start blowing into power lines and then a power lines go down that targets redirected back into the grid and then we start hearing these reports coming into nine one one that PG any transformers were blowing up\nAnd what happened [laughter] look like it wasn't the wire work that way I look at the bar on my way\nSo a lot of people were calling it was a report\nYeah so a lot of these reports are coming in and all these kind of small fires are getting started in a huge area across\nThis county and neighboring counties\nAnd um I remember talking to Aaron Abbott who is um that hadn't read calm and he's describing the map that they have where of all the calls coming in and then it was just\nFires everywhere and they didn't really have a great understanding of which ones were the big fires to start out with\nAnd the kinds of this red flag warning and the wind events these little sparks start getting out of control um really quickly but the calls keep coming in costs just for a smoke calls for my house is on fire and dispatchers are getting daily urged\n[laughter] hot [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] right now [laughter] okay\nSo your phone where we could describe as a lot of communications problems here I mean it was official said between officials\nYes there are a lot of communication problems and a lot of delays and part of it was this kind of you know as the ... report referred to a lack of situational awareness and an inability to kind of\nOr ... or or destroyed we need to be able to get these emergency alerts out to as many people all at once on cell phones and landlines radio TV and electronic highway billboards this legislation will now mandate that\nWe need to mandate training for emergency managers and I want to say thank you to the county cinema who has been a focus on overhauling their own emergency alert system but what we know is that\nWe're operating here in the county cinema on old information about our emergency alert system there actually were upgrades so at this legislation will now do is send emergency managers every year to training to learn the latest on\nThe way the system you have more staffing more longer periods of time as well right absolutely and we also right now where the land to Silicon Valley in California\nYet we still have some counties in the state they don't even know how to deploy an emergency alert because they don't have the technology to do so but trust me to ask you what about more and better communication between local governments and\nThat's exactly what we need to be able to do in this is what this is going to have this is what's gonna happen with this legislation you're going to have mandated training you're going to the local governments will now risk losing millions in funding if they don't overhaul their emergency alert system\nAnd the other really significant focus is we're bringing emergency managers\nFire chiefs local government the broadcasters association here in the coming twelve months to be able to establish this new emergency alert system that will be deployed all fifty eight counties and I'll end it right here Michael say that we also need to overhaul or mutual aid system\nOr the the chief it said that he called the mutual aid and I got to tell you we have the best\nFire chief in a state with Tony ... and very grateful for everything and he does [noise]\nUm [noise] but [noise]\nThirty five thousand thirty five thousand six hundred mutual aid calls were uh advance last year eleven thousand went unanswered the chief along with a chief Jones requested about three hundred and thirty fire engines in the first twelve hours of this place in about a hundred and fifty arrived\nWe also have to beef up our fire response in change they the way we respond to fire which means prefer positioning firefighting resources into communities are under threat of a red flag Ivins hot weather and high winds so that we have boots on the ground we don't have to wait for the calvary to come running\nCan I ask you a tree across or whether to what's being done on that score\nYeah ... you know when we had a red flag warning we typically wouldn't staff up unless there was uh\nIs being done on that score yeah well you know when we had a red flag warning we typically wouldn't staff up unless there was a\nUm incidents around the state so we were gone down in our county we look at Cal Fire we look at our other partners do we have resources on these other fires\nThe night of October ... I was Seventeen were full staffing so we with are wearing a good place the problem with that and I was we had three major fires happen in our area alone are county in Mendocino and Lake County\nAnd they were such extreme fires that all resources were drawn down immediately so we had ... strike teams or by twelve thirty at night and they really didn't show up till till the ... most of them 'til the sun was coming up\nAnd that's a difficult thing to do because\nWhat we had to do is just prioritize when when we did receive equipment we will just send them to communities I Need to go to coffee park time with his division and\nAnd you know do the best you can I Need to go to a mark less springs time with this division so that was simply what we're doing it was just pumping in resources and then on top of that you're dealing with buildings that have a hundred and twenty people and you can't let burn\nSo we had a we put three fire engines at one particular building made sure that that building and burn we had to protect guys or hospitals or you have to deploy resources to do that so when you have three thousand houses just in the city on fire it's very difficult to to feel like you're making a\nDifference you say very difficult maybe an understatement [laughter] as long as you go to ... Jones who's also with us here this morning show to ... like Napa unit chief was Cal Fire and the message is still coming from Cal Fire bug vegetation of a management of a defensible spaces and education\nWhat more I mean that's been kind of the uh tripod we've had than we've heard before especially in light of this like I said the worst fires ever hit was wealth or hit the state\nYes it has been a very since last October and for years prior to that we've had an enormous amount of education I'm basically from drought um it's the fuel loading that we've had has been enormous\nUm the fires that we've experienced statewide have been longer um and cause more damage than ever before our fire seasons are longer um\nThere's a lot of different things that are going on in the state as we continue to focus on vegetation management and uh luckily and unfortunately and look like or it might never spoke on the um [noise] a couple of the grant funds that had been afforded to Cal Fire\nI'm so Cal fire's able we've got I Believe it's a hundred and fifty five million dollars in forest health\nAnd fire prevention grants that are um get into the communities um get into local agencies have to fight for him to do some vegetation management because here's a reality on each if I Can't do it by ourselves and it's going to take a lot more we got here\nI'm from suppressing fire ... meeting Smokey the bear did a great job and his campaign is that wild land fires are bad which I think most people in my opinion um have\nI'm now pushed over two fires bad fire is not that I'm prescribed fire in the right capacity and the right a format is a good thing um um our forefathers used fire to help clear to land for\nUm forging and hunting and allowing those things we we don't want fire on in our area that we need to get back to it so prescribed fires during some vegetation management working with um ah the cooperate or is because again we can't do it by ourselves\nA working with the fire wife's communities are working with um many and then on non government agencies in order to um put some fire on the ground and put some vegetation management is what we're focusing on some\nSort of let me just quickly or go to you on some insurance came up in the last hour I liked her thoughts about it there was all article Bloomberg in fact about shielding or those who have high premiums set the expensive homeowners in other parts of the state which is a real issue for many people\nIt is and this is an FCC regulated a radio station so I'm not going to start testing I'm a ... a there we go uh what do say that it is an embarrassment\nAn embarrassment that we cannot get real reform the insurance industry to be able to help those survivors who had been impacted by the fire [noise]\n\nWe had a bill we had a bill that was being advanced that would have mandated across the board Seventy five percent pay out of an individual's belongings out when they lose their home in a governor declared disaster\nThe average by the way I'll say in the north a firestorm as far as insurance corporations they're paying out Seventy five percent\nSome did good and they weren't they didn't have to be brow beating to get there so we're not\nAnd what I Would say is that uh this legislature needs to grow a backbone\nStand up to the insurance industry and make sure that we're passing legislation that will help homeowners homeowners recover and rebuild because it has an impact or our economy and it's impacting lives and I don't say that lightly but it makes me mad as hell that we continue to fight over these\nMinimum reforms that will help individual rebuild their lives and um [noise]\nAlso say we've also seen significant reforms in the state and just going off of work chief Joneses that is Cal fire's now for the first time in history a year round firefighting force\nWe've invested forty point two million dollars and Cal Fire McClellan air attack base which is the largest ... during the state is now year round for the first time\nWe're finally phasing out all Vietnam Era firefighting helicopters for Cal Fire and replacing them with Black Hawk air attack helicopters that confided nine Seventy five million has been put into mutual aid but in particular\nFive million has been put into mutual aid but in particular are focusing on pre positioned so we can get those troops on the ground that both she's got her and she joins me prior to the event breaking out\nI should have coming up I'm afraid we have to get the rest of that when we return but we'd like to invite you in our audience to join us in our listeners\nAlso to join us in conversation a please raise your hand if you have a question or comment for any of our guests\nAre those have you on the audience and listeners can call us now at eight six six seven three three six seven eight six that's eight six six seven three three six seven eight six you can also tweet us ... or email us ... dot org and we'll continue our conversation after a short break\nOn Michael Krasny ... stay with us and\n[noise]\n\nThis was coming up tomorrow on for like ten author and writer at large for New York magazine Rebecca Traister will join us in the studio to talk about the power of women's anger and her new book good and mad and to listen to past shows and joined the discussion visit ... dot org slash forum\nAnd for the latest updates on our programs and our guest find us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter at ... for them and stay with us from or the special far along the road broadcast from the Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa [noise]\nIn October if there is a silver lining as it did force of the conversation at the national level to change the federal policy in pushing the telecommunications providers to provide additional capabilities for alert warning\nAnd this includes the ability to now provide Spanish language warnings there'll be effective next year\nThat would not have happened without the experiences that we went to an October\n[noise] we go to another\nTo an October [noise]\nLet me go to another a number of our audience false let's go next welcome thank you um my wife and I are senior citizens who are renting a home in coffee part for the last ten years\nI'm an about one thirty in the morning we got out of the house because of our personal vigilance and we were able to uh notify several of our neighbors of what was happening\nUm we got no warning whatsoever from anything ended the failure of the system was ... one of our neighbors died\nUm and like I say we were vigilant we did our part we really need your help and support and help to you can do about so this never happens again thank you [noise]\n\nTens of thousands did not receive a wireless alert one of the reasons I mean is it was mostly in Upton system\nAnd if you weren't a subscribe to nix all you may not have received the alert that is why we need new state wide standards we cannot rely just on cell phone technology and everything has to be an opt out you get the alert no matter if you like it or not\n... the city will it's in Mendocino County didn't have power cell coverage landline coverage Internet and cable for the greater part a five day during the firestorm in redwood complex fire\nThe only thing that they had was radio not one alert was distributed on a radio station with this legislation or our philosophy lab and proud and his many a medium communication mediums as possible\nBut let me read a comment from a listener named Carolyn and then maybe a\nYou or or a Chris can tell us about where people can go with these kinds of questions as well as perhaps answer ... question\nShe says can you ask your guest why I Am not getting any of the alerts including the latest ones I received all the next alerts fires last October once I opted in but it shouldn't stop receiving any alerts is it my carrier or phone or something else\nSo I'll jump on that is the director now responsible for the local emergency management warning system called so call alert\nWe did get a lot of feedback as a result of our tests on September tenth\nWhere people had signed up in the past and they did not get an alert or wireless message now there may be variety of reasons for some of them could be technical you're out of range your phone was off you didn't have it set an audible but in many cases we're finding that people that had signed up\nWe've got an incomplete record of their phone number they put in six digits instead of seven so we're asking every one that had an issue with that\nTo call us and let us know or go on line to confirm it so called ... dot org that their ... their accounts intact that their phone numbers are updated\nOr call the county officer emergency services I personally handled\nFour or five dozen phone calls it directly addressing this issue we need to get this accurate information into our registration system and especially in preparation for the new static state mandates that we're going to capture as much information from variety of resources so you're automatically enrolled in system in the future\nTo make a transition to the last hour and let me go to Shawn Johnson and uh to chief customer on this or just to get you to weigh in on it or are we talking about really a breaking rules for rebuilding as opposed to I'm really strictly following are strengthening the building codes I Want to find out where both of you stand to begin with you she's Jones\nDied Cal Fire is also the state fire marshal um the utilize that data from the damage inspection and that was done on the an\nEight thousand plus and structures that were damaged or destroyed to determine how they burn 'em what's sad the symptoms that that a particular structure burning was\nOn and develop new standards for um our\nFire codes et cetera um so they use that data in many ways that that primarily as one of the best ways that they use and and take that information and we also and\nSo since we're talking about preparation there's there's not to be another fire I mean it's kind of\nFires wild land fires are going to happen it's not a matter of a question as it is when so we all need to be prepared I'm there and I was ... when you asked me earlier some things that can be done um that that department's focusing on Rosa focusing on education and so on there said at a great app\nAnd it's a Cal Fire apps and that you can use for yourself you can download it and walk around your home and take a look at your property and see what you can do to provide clarity says there's also a I'm ready for wildfire dot org I encourage all of you to look at that and it gives you some opportunities to look at\nUm preparation for your home evacuation plans things that you should know people to contact fail I encourage you for that you\nTook us to go to you on this\nYeah sure you know the mayor a mentioned that Twenty one of the twenty two homes that were built that hardens standard perished and we have a fire station it was two years old that was built to that standard that perished\nAnd part of the problem is not all the buildings were built to that standard so when a house catches on fire and is allowed to burn burn very hot for very long time and those houses aren't even at a hardened or not designed to take that kind of heat for that to ration\nRight so I'm a big fan of if we're going to be building in these areas we need to build hardened homes\nExcuse me uh we need to build harder harder and homes and we got to pay attention to vegetation management it is a regional approach and we need to take\nUm it's I I Will remind you that fountain girls was a fire wise community they warn awards for the vegetation minute for a program coffee park wasn't even in the wildland urban interface\nTo areas that were just decimated at us because of what happens around us as opposed to what happens in us and so part of it is is a regional approach for vegetation managing\nHappens in us and so part of it is is a regional approach for vegetation management and it has to include everything burning like Sean I mentioned chemical mechanical grazing different land use a process is and we have to harden our homes\nOr as well as we got to maintain our homes so when we build a home we'll we'll put a little plant it's as big as my water bottle and a year later it's three feet tall and four feet wide right under our use of our house\nSo we there's ways to minimize the damage that can happen because there will be fire so we really just have to we have to educate more we have to get out more um and and there are ways to do it or we just have to be a better at it\nThe worst of places you came up in the last ... hours that something you're encountering a set of problem a year later\nYeah yeah you know everybody's in a different space right um there's everyone's busy in today's world and and I will never happen to me is what I hear a lot of and I'm here to tell you I've been\nSpoken many different forums and and uh I'm here to tell you it can happen to you so\nPay attention have that situation awareness take care of your property do what you can make your your system\nAre survivable that night we had such great when most people when they're it's windy you put all your furniture right next to the house and blow away that catches embers so if there's embers blowing through the neighborhood it catches those catches on fire and then burns up into the addict\nSo there's a lot of things that just makes me think of the vents too well we have special events hardened buildings have special events I I've heard sprinklers on the roof sprinklers would have done nothing for that firing at times I was just too windy\nSo we'll have tornado really right so there's a lot of there's a lot of things well this is what we can do but in reality they won't work based on what we experience but we can do is make sure our Latin landscape is taking care of our houses are hardened and we're aware of what's happening\nAgain Tony ... is a fire chief of Santa Rosa and let me go to the audience and if you want to join please just raise your hand we'll go next to Nancy Nancy welcome\nHello yes um I Lived on Bennett ridge halfway between Glen Ellen and a Santa Rosa we've got absolutely no warnings whatsoever of people knew that there was a fire and Ken would they knew that at our small fire station but they said it's it's it's a ways away [laughter]\n[noise] um and we got no alerts and my husband was signed up for next all he got an alert the day after the fire I'm there is there were sirens in a Kim would and I believe in Glendale and at the fire stations that we could hear on Bennett ridge\nAnd people could have been able to evacuate if they had heard that and just wake up and heard that ... and they would know that something was wrong most of us wake up because we smelt smoke\nOr we heard the people driving down the road and that was all that we had so I Would urge you to consider those low tech things in places like gr unveil [noise]\n\nThat'd be thank you a good yeah foreign reminder anybody want to come in\nTo know what I'm saying it's a it's kind of voters supervisors have really taken to heart what happened in our community and they're looking at a complete revamp of all these use emergency Miller an emergency response\nOne of the items that the board of supervisors there's currently looking looking at is deploying sirens in targeting rural areas throughout the county [noise]\nUm [noise] but [noise] I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "10"}
