some folks it makes no sense that President Trump has such a strong political base to Anthony Scaramucci President Trump's former communications director it's pretty obvious\nMr Scaramucci surfing brief rather dramatic tenure in the White House it blew up after ... foul mouth tirade aimed at former chief strategist Steve Bannon and former chief of staff Reince Priebus his new book explains what he learned during his time in the White House he's relationship to the president and his policies for the working class\nJoining us now from NPR in New York is Anthony Scaramucci his new book is called Trump the blue collar president Anthony welcome to want to say thanks so much rather let's start with that title trumped the blue collar president I think it might be an odd image to call him blue collar considering everything in his house is gilded\nBut I don't think that's quite what you mean by that yeah well\nListen I mean I tried to pick a controversial title I knew that the the people on the on the left side of the political ledger\nWould be upset with that title because Mr Trump has a gilded toilet and um\nThe apartment looks like Louis the fourteen smoke crystal meth and then decorated the apartment so I knew that would upset them by some footage ... yes yeah but I but I but I titled it that way because they grew up in a blue collar neighborhood I have blue collar parents never went to college and\nMy dad had an hourly workers job when he got started in his career and and the people that I grew up with a really like them and they support him even to this day and so I think there's a message in the book as to why they do that [noise]\nUm and and listen you know I uh I Try to open my mind up to everybody's fought and everybody's IDS I'm not close minded I understand the president has many flaws and I understand that people\nOn the side of the aisle that don't like him I understand why but I think the book has an important voice because the people on the other side of the aisle they don't like him I Would suggest that they read the book\nSo that they could get some sense for why he's at forty seven percent and climbing and why he's tightened up a um what could have been a blue wave these tighten up that race and made it a closer are and why he's getting countless thousands of people to show up at his rallies I think what's important for people to lose to understand it\nWell I I Will have to agree with that just hopefully they can understand well and I I think I understand where you're where you're coming from with that point it kind of\nIt makes me think about I don't remember if I don't know if you've ever seen Citizen Kane\nBut if you think about the character of Charles foster Kane when he starts to go into politics part of what

W. A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about it and then what kind of turned you around from that\nOcean either that or a quaint and ship with them for you know two decades and um I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past and\nI always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's eye of the run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided not the right time for me to run for president so there's something a little named George about\nThe word threatened not he floated the idea where he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah let's go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution among something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person as a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature or the other side\nHe floated the idea or he hinted at a friend's threatened\nThat say go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person as a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews because I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy one said\nThat he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side in it we can my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nWell when there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is the communications director where you\nTried to convince the president to to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that it pushed back is normal but\nThis kind of ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's\nIt's not productive I hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't\nLove to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know\nLike if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there was to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody we did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press with didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything\nI only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call and CNN had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nUh and you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know it came from scratch so I did in the square ought to have to I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted previous and Bannon out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nHe was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I have would have been happy to do that I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude in a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody that General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ...\nHaving into your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for nine of even beyond beyond that now I live right on the facts are like me any more than he likes the prize or at home and your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press he could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean\nI get the sense that the president just didn't agree with that [noise] um\nActually you know such damage or there's a funny a story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on\nI'm sitting in the oval office with them that Kenny and meeting where I'd been announces ... director is over it's him and I alone in the office I'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press coverage he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI listen while you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media first of all you're gonna lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well when you weigh better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with allegedly stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then they're they're also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside of the ... was like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling\nSponsorship that the cake you eat the life's dream bike Kennedy from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X Kennedy on demand\nIt that's right 'cause I'm just saying I'm inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over ... listen I just left they show where these guys like like they they really want them all day and night and so and they're calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energize and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like someone who John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want\nAll that stuff to be dialed down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to so so but but we have to do that as you got to tell them straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but will he'll say back to you as well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nOr and and this is always going to be as adults longest Donald J Trump is the president United States is going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and if you don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good and\nThe wild world midterm campaign ads and who's behind them I'm tending to Vegas and that next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I public radio

never win because I don't gamble no lottery for me and Jim wrote on our Facebook page I'll take my chances with finding out if I can handle the wealth or not\nSally us love you to respond to gyms comment in terms of finding out if you can handle the wealth once the money gone into your parents' hands how did they handle it\n[noise] and that's a great question and I'm I'm going to agree with him I'm not gonna lie everything that you know even if I say something negative about the wind today I have got get alliance such a hypocrite yes we have a ticket for tonight drawing\nHuh one way though you know wait a minute wait a minute you already one day when one afternoon when if you win the lottery UK wind wise it was it may\nIt it it's interesting because you know when people hear a million you know I I never realized how much it decreases like if you take the cash option then Uncle Sam had hands out like I Need Fifteen times in that first year it just it really dwindle piano\nPlease don't get me wrong I down and she was or not to tie and all that but uh [laughter] you know but I Will say that\nIt it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents didn't share a small portion with my brother and I you know what that means that my kids can literally cheese any primary and secondary education goal they well they didn't go to any school for any amount of time they can do\nAnything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that sure drain\nDo it you know and that's an absolute blast say my husband and I was staying in South where sales we would have been able to afford that any way but it's nice to have that cushion right um so there are blessings but I Will say that the women has shown me personally the absolute\nDark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women that I have actually experienced it I'm sure my parents would have many many more stories um and\nIn speaking about my parents it it's strained relationship you know I've chosen to become\nExtremely private about this\nWhen my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away\nBecause my parents want in a state where you cannot remain anonymous and for them that with habits because they love to brag about it they loved that lab actually like it like look at bay where I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear you know I'm I'm\nKind of fear based anyway you know you worry about the people that are going to kidnap your kids for ransom I worry about my parents someone hitting them over the head making sure everyone stays home and\nI'm Sorry I don't know I I Know we got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the store was where your parents bought that winning ticket and say something to them before they bought it what what would you say\n[noise] it would be the same thing that I Would tell\nAnyone who won tonight or if he won two million dollars each one two billion dollars that does that matter I think it\nIt's they absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear you know surround yourself with a great taint a CPA a financial advisor at attorney but my big advice would be to be careful\nSponsorship of the cake he read the lives dream my sanity from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with extended beyond demand\nHowever you know you've had yeah the scale of your new state has to match their ability to serve you and you know if you can't remain anonymous consider options that allows you to remain as anonymous as soon\nAs possible and then you control the message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be aware of people's actions no matter how subtle you've gotta create your own litmus test he becomes your tried right right not your close family and it's not your ...\nI really do appreciate you sharing your story with us despite your decision to remain anonymous Sally we'll call you but certainly we appreciate your sharing that with the stakes were much for talking to us\nThank you good luck to everyone with a ticket including
