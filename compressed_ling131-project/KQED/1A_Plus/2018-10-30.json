I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like ... job is not the only place where this kind of speech proliferate on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment a quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you're allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given to the new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome folks like you\nShirt well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true it said how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the laughter where there is anti Semitism it's true that there is anger\nBut we've seen nothing like the white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported nimble than from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the last two is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and light Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic tropes until we yeah\nBut it was a ... I'm Sorry where am I going to do you want to get a little deeper into that\nA lot of Fox a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one

Charlie wars and an ... let's get some more of your questions and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland right I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre\nIt was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in two years we were told it was just trumping Trump's telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and rude if you liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily

outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions there needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that his anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignored\nRants if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nWell thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious situation also very much by mistake\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views and a close connection instead of Israel I mean uh I teach at a a small just ... here in the city and\nOr in the in the suburbs and a lot of us do feel uncomfortable outs yeah build that up\nYou know the express a strong in here that if Israel or its best religious views that aren't um\nYou know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you were how the school deals with it\nBut I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their camps as an friendly they find professors especially a friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left and that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do tell kids probably shouldn't need need to shut up you know a lot of fish that up that you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that she kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard\nThing to pick their battles I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised to do that and not\nThe not federal everything well David that um that can be can be very hard David let me\nPut that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say the Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school student shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and laughed and very often it expresses itself as\nAs attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is it anti Semitic which is not and you can criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of his house governmental policies that we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear it outright us places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policy it's that rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out as a carry out violent acts and say that they're motivated by hatred of Israel that the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store manager of a store and the Senate God\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism they'll laughed\nWhat's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred or ... racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government it would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the last hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... criticizing\nCriticizing any kind of hatred and he was trying to restore civil discourse to the U.S and said we have somebody at the very top elite encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nLet me get to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation will get as many of your calls as we can as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better Indira would you react to that I feel like part of what worked [laughter]\nI hate to say in Pittsburgh favorable one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described scroll hill is it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had someone crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nThat's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU kind of ... University in pet\nAnd a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentist it's an educated community at tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically liberal community and voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community as Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm there to do though has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming and we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb with apparently had it for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago an attacker killed five reporters in Indianapolis News written the capital Gazette so you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hate for actions because of group polarization that happened\nThen just attack on what endeared just mentioned CNN is reporting that suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted in a post office in Atlanta let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how you doing today", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "30"}
