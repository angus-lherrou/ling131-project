A. M. A. U. dot org\nKatie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states\nRight right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending your senses\nAre the census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of\nUh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThere's a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways uh some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power\nFrom other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty\nOr that the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate\nA in crazy ways in ways that\nWhere the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own hiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see\nThrown around a lot of in this next redistricting\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing state of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress to both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington the Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive said from his entire decade and that the Conor Lamb seat in the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no weighing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as as well as the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when\nMore votes state wide for a chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the that the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the states and North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their district here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience hottest taught us topics including with Michael who wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap that's all the same in North Carolina Laura\nThey were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election that'll load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina law by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we want it to see if you could tell the difference\nBetween the map of gerrymandered district and an ink blot on a ... test you can find that quiz if you search the word gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. B. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a doc Ford\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that twenty sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really uh being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders I'm with these messages about draining the swamp and the political revolution and\nI realize that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about gerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't hurt or that popular a proposals aren't being passed at the local level\nThe latest from inside the divided Census Bureau next time I'm hearing now which will come your way tomorrow morning at eleven\nSupport for NPR comes from the station I'm from love me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform allowing people to connect around the globe to get work done learn more it go to meeting\nCan act around the globe to get work done learn more it go to meeting dot com from lumber liquidators suffering flooring installation nationwide with new styles of hardwood and would look waterproof flooring more lumber liquidators dot com or one eight hundred to two seven four zero three six\n[noise] and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nQuick worried about what we'll be discussing this time tomorrow will be a conversation about how we all have at work\nChances are that you have worked somewhere that made you feel like you had to be perfect show no fear never screw up and avoid asking for help\nNot the easiest working conditions but what else is there research or ... brown argues that the same kind of empathy we see in our personal lives should carry over to our workplaces if we want to do our best\nWe would like to know if you have ever worked somewhere like that a company where you felt safe to be yourself\nYour whole self\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five\nTo three six one a one day how much are you able to be yourself at work\nDoes your company feel like a safe place to just be human or do you have to arm or up before you clock in everyday tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a\nOr you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a high quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics we will share some of your stories when Bernie brown joins us in Studio tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Katie face he's a founder and executive director of voters not politicians David daily senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent\nFor the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election mark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle\nSteve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like a goofy and Donald Duck facing one another seriously if Google it\nSpeaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world he sent us a link\nTo a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com Mrs they say\nGerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida fourth Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry\nA hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states we got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIsn't fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know\nThe Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word\nFrom a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nOr to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper down in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he it was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nUm you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know the\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talked about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south\nThat were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland uh there's one district to out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans\nHave done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about a fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing\nGenerally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that the these winds may not be fair right but the the people who who cry furnace tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the all tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the GOP is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to re district by a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and say so publicly\nKatie fishy I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks are that you've been witness to a folk kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all look to government ... at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know where is also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are some Republicans who live in those districts into their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're\nThat us special about it there I'm representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least transparent states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard while you're doing this town halls with a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn than eight years later some emails coming coming out a talking directly about how the lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us and not special interests and\nWhat's been really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have giant voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did work\nI'm happy that Thanksgiving dinner or your family yeah my mom gathered five hundred signatures and its canvassing every day they got thirty days till the election so it's been really exciting I mean you see a lot of people who are like you know there's nothing that we agree on", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San
