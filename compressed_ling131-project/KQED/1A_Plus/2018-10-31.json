A. M. A. U. dot org again across America at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua last joining us from K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happen to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them\nIn the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas with regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth so a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over the last midterm elections\nShe can let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase or over the last midterm election so I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has an election just 'cause the turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so if we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTwenty four can we add six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAre we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian ... what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs following those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know uh they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballads\nProbably let me speak with you how does early voting worked in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through how does Kansas handle voting early\nWell it it it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county is a way they decide um obviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who would like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters who like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition and leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWill ah basically you get your ballot in in the mail they mail it to you um you so you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um\nYou go through the subjects one by one it's great because uh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and fill\nOut that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational or a cup of tea my whatever you want to do it with\nUm you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado a but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut in every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is um jak bearing mind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hands on election day\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie to vote early and Michigan\nFor all practical matter is yes so basically how it works in Michigan it's if you want an absentee ballot you have to basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say ... and there are folks that go and say should be out of town\nAnd and lie at their office in other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be over sixty years old and now there is a may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early\nI possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to sit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three\nFour hours and ... so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWe're speaking to Philly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael\nSponsorship as a cake you eighty life's

Kansas that suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently\nWe discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation Josh what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation to United Methodist church of the resurrection in league with Kansas or\nTell us about your topic sure we'll leave it as a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City of downtown Kansas City Missouri which brings misery and a couple and the Kansas on and it's a very diverse congregation it's a highly educated largely a highly educated\nWe have um we did a poll that long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and for you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderates progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nThe Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independence are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leading to put it so we ever were pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country\nYou know fairly well they're kind of divided we've been divisions ... exactly that's exactly right it's so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader speak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I constantly have not constantly better regularly get emails from folk saying well you know you're being too political I Wish you wouldn't talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates but what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio sponsor TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely I pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in a value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor as a minister lean into the political debates and a religious lens on them\nAs opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from like I imagine there are some weeks where you say let's just do a sermon on you know ... or ... I just do a sermon on the story of the garden to be anything but ... yeah\nSo here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this than the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday based on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday mornings and and again probably Sunday Morning and so what I've said is and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance\nAnd yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these seems the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my aim isn't that I mean I I think people are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to a church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYear round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where when are the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know somebody has to be said when there's a school shooting\nAnd even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to\nTake a look and see how you know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical lick lecture on ethics\nWe're gonna look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I tried to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation then I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but this is obviously this issue right now\n... guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I've surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that wants to take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and and it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left in the right on some of these basic things\nNow that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality in actual policy\nYeah uh it does actually so so here we are talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond to you know the issues of shootings in school so the shootings in schools is that presenting or just violence in our communities and the presenting issue and so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but they're\nSponsorship of the cake you eighty life's dream come true ... any sleep are all featuring temper ... temper memory thumb can provide personalized comfort you when you have to help the night's sleep by reducing national transfer and responding to a user's unique shape weight and temperature learn more in the late ... dot com\nOr you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise] so so there's a part of that that's going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another person that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense and in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA\nAre all gun toting nuts but I I have friends and people who I loved dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting in the school on the other side you know you've got the these are people who want to take all your guns away\nThese are people who want to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and you can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at our church do they want a place to deal with the social issues\nThat they want a refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture but did he want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes [laughter] a lot of if I if I get emails\nAcross the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talked about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nAnd uh but I've got other folks are like so immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated from the news broke about that [noise]\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town on hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying it and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how it's going to resolve 'cause I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I had people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on the switch and and the next week and I did I did that was Father's Day we can talk about it but um\nSo I it's all over the map on that are there but here's we we also served the congregation we find out we were doing and worshipped survey to find out about music and different things what they what they wanted to ask about the sermons which the sermons or do you find most compelling\nAnd then I'm On a response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world but for every person says that there's somebody else who's saying I Wish you wouldn't do that and you just stick to talking about love\nWe're speaking to Adam handles into founding pastor of the United Methodist Church the resurrection in league with Kansas outside Kansas City\nIs the author of more than two dozen books his latest is called unafraid living
