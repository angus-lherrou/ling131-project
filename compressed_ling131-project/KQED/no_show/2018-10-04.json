foundation\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I Know said Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro the FBI is expected to release a supplemental background check of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh late tonight or early tomorrow\nThen senators and some top aides will look at it but looking at it may take some time only one copy of the report is being made available to the entire Senate\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell still insists the Senate will vote on the nomination this week joining us to talk about the latest as NPR's Scott Detrow joining us from Capitol Hill Hi Scott near there so the FBI had a full week to do this they haven't used that entire week does that give us some clues about the scope of the report\nWhat we've seen several clues that it's likely on the more limited side the FBI had a week to do this and as you mentioned they wrapped it up two days early we also know that the White House was directing the FBI and how broadly are narrowly it would focus that report and the White House was able to do that because this is a background investigation not a criminal probe\nSo only one copy of this report will be made available to the entire Senate not one per senator and each party is going to have one hour to look at it what do you make of that I think they're mostly\nDoing it some people like me aren't able to find a copy a committee leadership wants to make sure this one leak so the report is being held in the secure ruined the Senate uses for confidential information only senators and a half dozen or so staffers with security clearances will be allowed in\nNo notes can come out nobody's allowed to talk about it\nAnd this is really frustrating Democrats who say this is not a transparent process and that given how the public this was all bend the public should know the conclusions of the report\n[noise] we know that the FBI has not talk to at least one key witness Christine Blasey Ford her lawyer says she has not been contacted how do Democrats and Republicans feel about that\nWell a lot of top Republicans are just fine with that I asked John Cornyn the number two Republican in the Senate about this as he got into an elevator earlier today by going over there we we heard from Memphis is referring to last week public testimony of course the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has said something similar\nDemocrats said that makes no sense that the whole point of following up was confirmed or dispel what cabin on forward it said so the FBI should follow up and asked about what is learn here's Democrat Richard Blumenthal\nThe leaves are followed the interviews creates additional questions [noise] sometimes they re interviews [laughter] that's very common [noise] and that's an investigation [noise] got to be more than just check the box okay we have their accounts\nAt the end of the day there are three senators who remain undecided have they said anything about the investigation and whether not hearing from Kavanaugh or Ford again it looks like a problem to them\nYou know it's been hard to hear from Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins about all of this because in a way

considered I Know if the Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories\nMany for the first time Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAnd her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how many people have been sharing this column on line that I spoke with Monica ... about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of\nSurvivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail some women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this make him cry\nSomeone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy hand he thinks it's his job to protect any and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different category is a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world as a young one and\nAnd so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking\nSponsorship of particularly the live stream by deference master of

thinking about tropes in sitcoms where the dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery story that he can ever make we do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on a spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women\n[noise] can you tell us about some of the responses that you have to this call them since it was published this week\n[noise] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yep please gear Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions\nI shared your call in with my wife of forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be up some comfort semper fi\nWell so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you on murder then and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone\nUm so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell her father's about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dad for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and that they have enough for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ...

of the properties rush Newton or is an investigative reporter for the New York times\nThanks for joining us today Thanks for having me are\nThe New York times story you just heard him out says the trumps were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law that can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is talk spawning as usual is one thing to have a self serving valuations that are on the ... side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades has simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources that are not going to be allocating at tort gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true with the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat appears to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transaction some on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years pro public eye has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it\nAnd why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations but severe says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News there's a new mandate for\nCorporations in California
