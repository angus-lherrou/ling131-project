released just\nDays before the election\nLike directly to the Russian government in the crowd you got to stop it\nHow how did you do that without compromising freedom of speech\nThe very idea of

for you and even if you assemble a committee of good in truth citizens how can they know\nTake the idea of a single truth such as whether or not climate disruption has been significantly accelerated

minutes of the production of technician media [noise]\nFrom San Francisco I boy or a cat and this is tech nation today a technician I speak with Dan roam the founder of the napkin academy drawing pictures in the world of information overload is more essential than ever to communicate effectively\nThen on technician health a new model for tackling diseases which affect a small number of patients find\nThe scientists where ever they are and build small companies around them and she's corresponded Dr Daniel craft tells us new ways to determine the health of our hearts\nYou may well no Dan round from his books on visualization including the very first one the back of the napkin to his latest draw to when he's here today to talk about rethinking how we think\nDan welcome back to technician Ira thanks so much for having me back on just delighted and you open your latest book with a quote from Leonardo da Vinci unreal eyebrow let me hear\nFrom the ... the day the air's filled with countless images which acts as a magnet is that how you feel\nOh my gosh and you're reminding me I haven't thought about that quote since I wrote the book\nAnd I started out intentionally number one I wanted a quote from Leonardo because if you think about really good visual thinkers he's got to be among those on the very top of the stack and I love this idea that you open your eyes in the morning and there is the world just waiting for you to look at and see what you can see\nAnd it's so interesting to me because Leonardo he had no choice but to hand draw his images he seemed to do just fine\nHe he did great you're referring of course to his various no books that are full of\nSuch thinks of the things that Leonardo invented right so we had the first helicopter drone on the margins of one of his notebooks\nThe first parachute all of these different kinds of battle men's or an F ... all of this stuff\nOr ... flapping wings machine that's right 'cause he was thinking that we were going to fly he he has all of these sketches of birds in flight thinking that maybe 'cause flight which is one of the things I also love about Leonardo how many of these things relate to getting into the air\nYou thought we'd be able to fly like birds that didn't quite work out but the funny thing about the parachute that he sketched out five hundred years ago interestingly enough\nMaybe five or six years ago a Swiss engineer went in and looked at Leonardo was sketch in the margins of one of his notebooks and built the parachute as Leonardo had designed it\nAnd was taken up to you know eight thousand feet or something and jumped out of a plane using Leonardo was parachute and lived [laughter]\nBecause they don't know it was pretty sharp [laughter] and then he had a backup shoot that wasn't designed by Leonardo da Vinci keypad invaded he would be joining Leonardo since ...\nYeah well what's so fascinating to me is that when you say it that way how his mind worked had to be visual it had to have all of these elements that he literally tossing\nThat big data explosion the big analytics explosion that it has nothing to do with technology and a real sense it has to do with our ability to actually put these things together which are in power now by technology\nWell and this being tech nation I was thinking it would be lovely to talk with you a little bit about the word you just mentioned data\nI read recently the statistics and IBM in their global planet report last year publish this information that they estimate Ninety percent of all of the data\nThat is in the world today was generated in the last two years alone Ninety percent of all the recorded data in the world today was generated the last two years according to idea that I followed up with I haven't had any statistics on the top of my mind\nCisco published a report estimating that something like Ninety five percent of all information conveyed through the Internet is visual information put those two together and massive amount of data out there massive amount of visual information why\n'cause data all by itself doesn't mean a lot to us but one we can put it together into a picture and see how all those data points lined up and what they illuminate all\nOf the sudden our mind gets happy and one thing I Would love to talk with you a little bit as we go on and this is you've mentioned it already we have data that leads to data visualization and that's kind of old ... at this point I ... the good doctor tough de starts Twenty years ago thinking about data visualization and other ... other leaders\nAnd then we started to have kind of uh information visualization coming out probably in the last ten or twelve years with\nCompanies like tap blow and other people that make sophisticated not just data analytics now the way I like to break it down is dated this realization in my mind typically allows you to take maybe maybe two or three dimensions of data and map the mom to each other and say OK these numbers plus these numbers give me this picture\nInteresting I think that information visualization\nDouble or triple that to where you can actually take seven or eight different dimensions of data and map them together into a much more sophisticated kind of a graphic maybe it includes time maybe it includes\nManipulate all trends you can actually move through it backwards and forwards and add additional data ... now I Would call that information visualization\nAnd ... you know where we're about to go wire\nKnowledge visual and they're you know we've got data visualization were good now it better information visualization\nLet's be FAIR data is interesting but I don't really want the data I Want the information that comes from the data but even the information isn't that interesting because what I really want is that knowledge that comes from the information I imagine if we have something called knowledge visualization what would that even look like\nI don't know but I Want it now I Want to do too and I think we're chipping away I say we because myself and some friends and colleagues who are all\nHad us now I Would call that information visualization and wherever you know where we're about to go wire knowledge visual and they're you know we've got data visualization were good now it better information visualization\nLet's be FAIR data is interesting but I don't really want the data I Want the information that comes from the data but even the information isn't that interesting because what I really want is that knowledge that comes from the information I imagine if we had something called knowledge visualization what would that even look like\nI don't know but I wanted now I Want to do too and I think we're chipping away I say we because myself and some friends and colleagues who are all visual people or data people or technology people are chipping away at this and what we've done\nAnd this is fun to be able to share with you a little bit\nOne of the things that was really great in going back and writing this new book draw to win ten years after having written the back of the napkin\nWas to go back into the latest science around human visual cognition so many new insights and find number one this is really cool we now pretty much know\nThat vision human vision is a predictable process what I mean by that is if you think about vision the biochemical near a logical physiological\nSystem that's going on in our head converting light into meaning it's the system and just like the way our heart pump blood or the way that we walk for all people\nThat system works and essentially the same way we'll walk you know we have our own little someone has your own little hitch in there get along kind of walk but for the most part we all walk the same way\nVision is the same for all of us and the beauty of it is when you understand what our visual engine\nOur minds by our visual neocortex are retinas are trying to do with the vast amount of information in front of us\nThey're trying to force it through a series of filters and lenses to draw meaning out and they're doing it in a very specific way and we now know what that way it is which means if there's something I Want to explain to you\nI Know if I could do it visually I Know exactly which pictures your visual mind is hoping to get next\nWhich means that I Can't explain anything by creating these very simple pictures in this particular sequence and you and I are going to understand it almost exactly the same way and I think that is where knowledge visualization\nGoing to come from [noise] I've always tell my students for instance that information and data in context\nAnd you know data could sit there how it's meaningless and all of a sudden really important to them and goes back to meaning [laughter] so there it is I'm really looking forward to information going that knowledge at once that lead to and we don't quite know it yet but I can see people pushing on it and\nIt is a very important thing today\nThat we'd be able to take all of this complexity around us and be able to reduce it\nTo pictures people understand pictures they're ready to understand pictures how many times if I sat in a meeting and somebody brought out a three inch report with a one page executive summary they didn't even get the executive summary then what does it mean if you can drop share\nIt makes all the difference in the world to me it's an essential skill today to get work\nSo it is in fact I Would push it even a little bit further and this is actually something that I talked about in the book truck to when\nI Believe that the conversation today the bigger conversation the global conversation\nIs visual and if you want hate business person to be in that conversation you have to be visual too now there are people who say oh my goodness this is terrible this is a loss of verbal literacy I Do not agree I think on the contrary what's happening is\nThere have only ever been a limited number of people who were really truly effective verbal communicators anyway and it was a very exclusive group and attended some times to exclude people who might not have been as verbal I find that visual thinking is a much\nFaster way for people to be able to actually understand complex concepts and then participate I find it a much more democratic way of sharing information because when you draw a picture\nAnd there's something that is not understood or factually wrong it immediately obvious which is not true when you're just a ... talking about something words are very very easy to miss construct or to intentionally tried to skew\nAnd make it right by what did you say oh I didn't say that I did I ever said that I met this or not that the picture is the pictures that takes you to\nPicture speaks the truth and I often say to people when when I when I have a lot of businesses that come to me and asked for consulting around\nYou know really complicated initiative or a strategy or a new product that that everybody inside the organization really needs to get on literally on the same page about 'em and I will often say to them be careful what you wish for I'm delighted to work with you to go down the visual path but if\nThere is something kind of hidden away in your business that is politically untouchable\nLet's not even draw pictures because it's going to come to the surface the truth will the truth will come out when you start to dry it and if there's something in the truth that you want to avoid let's not even engage let's not even draw the picture at all I think it's fascinating the power of the image to be able to get us towards\nYou and I seeing the same thing and when that happens while do the lights go on\nDan ... is the founder of the napkin academy and author of draw too when we'll talk more after a break [noise]\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nCasts nation and technician health are available NPR One I can just hear and that their pod cast indication out coming up and the second half of our show I technician now\nA new model for going after genetically to intervene to protect a small number mission and she's tired mind and Dr Daniel craft counts that had to know their status of our heart [noise]\nMm [noise]\nOne other thing that's happened since I saw you was the publication of 'em I Want to say it was Joshua wolf fours book moon walking with Einstein fabulous book about how human memory works\nAnd he was the guy this books probably seven or eight years ago now that really sort of brought home for ... for all of us this notion of the memory palace\nThat if you really want to remember a lot of things what you do is you associate each thing you want to remember to some sort of visual object you place that visual object in a in a palace in your mind\nAnd you will never forget it and so the same thing happens we've created visual memory palaces throughout our house my wife's in real estate someone we're talking about\nHow to real estate systems work we draw them out who's the buyer who's the cellar with interest rate what's the price with X cetera or when we're talking about I'm reading a book one of our daughters might be reading a book of history for school\nAn imprint England Random House and we were again you're listening to technician [noise]\nWelcome to technician health reimagining the future of health and health care with the emergence of new technologies and breakthroughs science today on technician health a new model for going after genetically driven diseases which affect a small number of patients\nFind the scientists wherever they are and build small companies around them [noise]\nThen chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft refused progress in knowing the health status of our hearts\nIt's not unusual for biotech companies to work on a number of diseases all at the same time they usually they do that work under a single company and then one or at most two different locations bridge bile has a different model Neal Kumar is it CEO\nYeah well first of all thanks for having me on and as great pleasure to speak with you we have a slightly different model that allows us to go uniquely after some very small diseases\nAnd so I guess the whole point of any model is to say okay what science do we find interesting in this case it says science behind genetic disease\nAnd then how do we actually go after it and it can't be by building a normal biotech because of normal biotech has twenty to twenty five people and labs and a whole bunch of fixed costs that they carry on and that's too expensive to go after a patient population of a couple of hundred patients let's say or a couple of thousand patients\nAnd so we have a model that effectively variable as there's a lot of those fixed costs we have a central platform and then every time we fight an interesting project we start a new company but that new company only has a few scientists that really understand that space within it\nAnd they can draw from June a function or generalized R and D functions from bridge by farmer and then come back when they're done so it tends to lead to much more capital efficiency er which then in turn allows us to go after small things\nAnd so we have bridge ... that's the sort of the parent company ... if you will that's right and every time you come up with something new new company does write a company that bridge by has like okay who needs pencils\n[laughter] probably probably a little bigger than that [laughter] that's on Sunday Now but uh but\nThe science courses at the core of each of these projects why it a different different set of scientists have to be there give us some examples of that that genetically driven diseases you're working on\nYeah so I mean what we we think about these diseases in three different categories really uh the first or the classic inherited diseases like you hear about Tay Sachs or sickle cell a we have a number of programs in these sorts of areas TD arm or do says Carlin syndrome you may not have heard of each one of these ...\nAbout\nTwenty five million Americans so those those are what we think about as many daily and disease then there's a series of water called germ line cancers there's also inherited diseases or pediatric cancers which more people have heard of\nWe break them out separately because there's more of awareness around pediatric cancer\nAnd then there are what we call ... cancers\nWhich developed later in life these can be any sort of cancer a lot of what like lock so pharmaceuticals and others are going after theater cancers that arise where there's a very clear genetic driver so what what sort of binds all of these programs together is that you can from mutation really precisely understand what's driving the disease\nSo it's not like heart failure diabetes where there are a lot of different things going on there's the genetics there's your diet there is you know all sorts of different he's asked invading factors these are very clearly quantitatively driven by the mutation and that's what we focus on\nI guess one of my questions says do you have the house in different places I mean there's nobody has a different color named\nTad hadn't even thought that they have a couple of scientists here and a couple of scientists there yeah\nSo we we think are a lot about okay who are the people that really need to be part of the company and it's usually the people that have wanted to phenotype each one is that they really deeply understand the biology and typically those people are coming from an academic lab that have been looking at disease acts for Twenty years Thirty years sometimes\nAnd so we go to where those people are so we have subsidiaries in Memphis in Montreal in Paris and San Francisco of course in Boston it's where the science and it's where it's where those it's where the science of where the experts are\nAnd we try to set up around them and then the second type of person that's really important to us are people that understand the clinical manifestations of the disease and can help of development and so in many cases will located around them especially if the later stage program\nSo yeah I mean we're basically geographically young constrained um and but what we've done a lot in our backyard and San Francisco just 'cause you know we're there [laughter]\nAnd it's a pretty large ... yeah right [laughter] now here's another interesting now I expected when I read your bio to find a life scientists and science executive all year degrees or in chemical engineering\nNot step with that you're not that they were these ... what's going on while you're an engineer as they see you know that I [laughter] I I think that uh so I I actually entered chemical engineering at a very interesting period of time\nBecause the traditional and maybe some of my professors would would kill me for saying this but my my perception was the traditional chemical engineering disciplines were dying like oil and gas plastics where all of us use to go separations things like that there wasn't there's not a ton of research going on there are a lot of the really important problems that are already been solved\nSo when I entered chemical engineering a lot of new research was going on in ... by biotechnology\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware delusion celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it Hooper micro dot com\nThe traditional and maybe some of my professors would would kill me for saying this but I my my perception was the traditional chemical engineering disciplines were dying like oil and gas plastics where all of us use to go separations things like that there wasn't there's not a ton of research going on there a lot of the really important problems that are already been solved\nSo when I entered chemical engineering a lot of new research was going on in the by biotechnology industry in fact a lot of the early folks associated with Jen diamond Jeanette intact and you know the whole thing of manufacturing these new types modalities they were chemical engineers\nAnd a lot of the faculty at Stanford and MIT ride trains were actually in biotech and in some of those early\nDays so I did all my research at the corner of biology and chemical engineering and my PHD or wasn't cancer signaling so so it's kind of yeah telephone generic has\nChanged life science now that that way [laughter]\n... exactly engineering building and the life and I [laughter] yeah\nSo you know I mean I think there's a discipline now called of biological engineering that didn't exist when I was in school but it really is um [noise] yeah it's a ... I mean if it's at the corner of a lot of engineering disciplines in biology but certainly there are some chemical engineering biology intersection there\nI mean we we are so many times we forget that we've got you know okay all this organic matter and really look at our brain and then we have all the leaves the electrical signals and we have we have an history in there and it's like all of these things are working together yeah we had the broken up into separate silos\nYeah it's kinda interesting you say that because I mean for me engineering is sort of like this uh this way of simplifying very complex problems and there is no more complex problem than\nA biology and then putting some quantitative real rules around it\nAnd so you know if you think about self for instance you think about it sitting in an extracellular you know Neal you it's interrogating all that information then there are all these signals going through the cell and then it decides to do something like\n... for eight or migrate or do something like that and you ask yourself OK so a biologist or reduction area scientists would look to build up a set of data and understand how all of those steps happen that's really hard\nAnd so an engineer a ton of abstraction says a little bit like okay I'm going like there's a there's a cue there's a signal there is a response this was kind of what you know\nIt's a law firm broke at MIT has been talking about and you put it that all together and how do I model it and how do I start to get some predict of understanding of how this might change if a drug intervened or you know if I intervened at the at the output level and so that I think engineering is kind of uniquely suited to answer some of these questions not not all of them but some of them\nHe should work at NASA that's where the scientists to me the engineers\nAnd [laughter] right [laughter] right\n[laughter] I I I think it's really interesting because\nAt the end of the day all of these challenges are going to be solved by humans and they have to be working in all different kinds of ways", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22"}
