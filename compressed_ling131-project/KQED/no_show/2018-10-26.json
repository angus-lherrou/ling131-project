attention why do you think that just got such international attention\nWell ... it's an outrage assigned to isn't it or to use that kind of substance on the on the streets of a foreign city in order to secular school I think he is something that a lot of people find extraordinary and you know\nIn in the sense of that was that it's an extremely provocative thing but some people I think to have trouble believing the British Government narrative annual its details I have to say though you know as time has gone on and particularly things we've seen in the last month now off\nWith the identification of two suspects and then rushing Janice and experts working to find out the real identities of those people who came to the u._k. on CNN and then to link them to this ministry intelligence service to jail you you know it'll do seem to be pointing pretty clearly in that direction\nLet's talk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what is it do\nWell at the Russian initials stands for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct threats of\nThe Russian general stuff the ...\nOr the ... that I think some plans for the Russian ministry and this is the

he was invited in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approach you and he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well that are described in my book\nAnd I think this protein to the attention of the geo you as being the kind of stay the guy who who had the right stuff and they invited him you United says an exam\nAnd he goes through that

with mark urban of BBC's news night his new book is called the scribbled files regarding the poisoning Martin asks there were five people substantially exposed to the nerve agent in ... one of whom died what's the condition of the others mark\nI'm well a so those people on Nick Bailey who was a police officer who went to the script ... house on the day of the poisoning he is a much better but still not ready to return to work [noise]\nUh of course a Charlie Rose ... who was one of those\nWho are then found the bustle\nOr in the summer in June and uh he's hot in the dorm study 'cause the person who died Charlie Rose the lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts\nAnd then of course you get to UT a script pile and ... and\nUh she was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can infer from that but to how to a lesser dosage\nAnd uh so I suppose you could say the most seriously affected person who survived well ... himself\nUm when I interviewed the medical stuff their hospital you you had a clip earlier of a dumpster Steve inject\nThey was saying well ah we think that will be some side effects about age very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... and the prices of combat essence that's my understanding that there are some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discuss ah the specifics that advice because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there are still going to live on the ends\nWith regard to Yulia ... daughter ... emailed\nIt's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a G R U employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London\nConsidering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident the big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order\nMark I'm well I I'll just pick holding one little bits of Anna's a description that\nThe the two people the two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe how they arrived the previous day at a different ... got wake a she arrived then on the science data ... at Heathrow\nA on a plane for mostly but anyway um\nLet's just talk about uh that's just a detailed um look there is definitely something ... about a half\nA rival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\n'em and right from the outset people I was speaking to who were involved in in trying to work out what has happened investigating a believed that the timing was critical\nNow we know even more so that the suspect a named as ... had been in the u._k. an exact same here and the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team and I think it's on twenty Seventeen and then another man who's been isolated or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym ...\nHad been in the u._k. at the same time in ...\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks than any firm Comcast extended Internet delivers in home life by for all devices in the home\nEarly March twenty sixteen\nNow this raises questions about or would they ... pounds for some time whether they using the fact that she lived in Russia and therefore they hack a email account and not spend the nights by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty ... and indeed him ...\nUm she seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because have bravo Sasha had his birthday on the first of march [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a lake twenty Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically Sasha by the way who died but it's still supposed that she had come and twenty Eighteen to be with her dad at night time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigators that the timing of the attack was critically linked\nTo you this arrival ah hiking her data by females and stuff which said sure I'll come up from the ... is that your centers that Trump would help them to locate to make sure he wasn't a business trip or in some other way absent\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that I'm Yulia had bumps and he is a bit of a cab yet he is sold by some two of has connections with a one of the Russian intelligence agency thought\nHe was not on the scene for example back in twenty sixteen when it's believed that if I'm figure I'm using the Ninth Circuit for dose of travel to the u._k. he was not on the scene back in ... when the team when we know according to the u._k. government\nThat ... ... email account was hacked or he hadn't been on the scene for much more than a year so\nYou know we don't know and you know fantasies notes are here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some policy in this um that's we know that after the attack um [noise]\nUh well nearly a month off so that was a ... hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was ... that he had not been in touch with the hospital for example to find out how she was\nSo the idea that he kind of a vanished from the scene seems to have some substance or you'd have had access to the Internet since a fairly early on in a recovery we don't know whether she's reached out to him or\nWhether indeed they often ... by a social media or messaging or or email or whatever or buts we have to assume that they no longer income times\nTo get to a few more of your comments and questions from our urban another mark tweeted you got that out quick if it's half as good as your previous books it will be a pleasure and an education to read [noise]\nCO asked listening to this broadcast I was wondering if we knew why it was that he decided to defect to at my six mark you kind of suggested that he had kind of had enough that he had kind of lost faith\nAs it were in the G are you do have a sense of whether there was a last straw for certain they scribble\nEm yeah that's a good question um the way he describes it and it was a gradual process so when he was in ... which is Nineteen eighty four to eight to nine he says he was walking home he was recruiting souls his he was really playing the game",
