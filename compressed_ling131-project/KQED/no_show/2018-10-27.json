NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong case thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports they were assigned to control trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted to those numbers as historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economist expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressed with former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks aren't growing fast might like that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent that and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips in down in restaurants more Maloof as American CEO of I G the hotel group than on holiday learning ... among other brands which is an opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr set records around our Labor Day an immoral David share and fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more for protect are spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just consumers who are spending more government spending was also walked Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number despite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence in today's report\nA meager number [noise] despite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory Jaczko is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer real you're starting to see some headwinds appearing for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people and businesses over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nJak also cites a gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much for momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what ... calls they growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated\nThere's no
