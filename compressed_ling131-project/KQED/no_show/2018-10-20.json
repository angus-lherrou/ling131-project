point me as a father and I think it's best to Fiji [laughter]\nExcept that about each other and you know just let that go and be okay with that and he didn't say anything\nThat means that all this an English so it's possible her dad just didn't understand what she was saying maybe that's why she felt she could be so blunt needy she's saying these things more to herself into him because every time

necessarily mean that we should reorient our entire Middle East strategy\nI mean at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of a Tama bin Laden\nAnd was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood does as an individual you know\nWe have to take all of that into account and I also think that when you are dealing with who was operating as a journalist for the Washington Post and who is a U.S resident and do it now appears was murdered I Know what to do to cancel it and of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that we're interested in doing\nUm when you are talking about the middle east for talking about a lot of bad actors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nThe other options are not so great either right we have turkey which kills the highest number of journalists anywhere in the world we have\nIran we have a number of uh other countries that committed human rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our ducks in a row and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over that\nI find it really disturbing\nTo go back to his youth this\nPerson who has been a as close shouldn't have bought a sense of the word liberal in terms of demanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tore him as a young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is\nThis is a form of propaganda that can be is being used to kind of justify us off one here people should read his final\nPiece for the Washington Post which was really powerful call for freedom\nIn the Arab world it was really overweight and white and blue short of column and that ... has been and that is the man who was killed\nLet me ask you both to set aside for a moment questions about whether his past is relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U. S. and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis\nFor the United states with a Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations free\nI think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really messed up here um you know they've arrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they've arrested and dismiss five others\nHave eight again to stay at a statement from Saudi state TV yeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking it seriously um I think that they definitely need to rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat\nAmerican permanent residents that are living in their country\nEJ I'm lost tortillas thoughts on the where this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I think the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress or she just said as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that mom had been some some on M. B. S. as he is known\nThe crown prince is in our ... former ah I think this has really brought home the shortage\nOf his regime or that or were pressured his image will never be the same as it was a when

are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd ball and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you what gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little librarian the first place\nWell touch mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse\nTo honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very little tasked by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Rock and they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting them like seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that and it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that see I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people open the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when\nThe library what do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really lucked out reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships you know when I spoke with Todd in person on the phone he expressed how energized he writes about projects especially those that had to give it to use for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come out as sort of a little spring of hope among the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and the king long refugee settlement in western Uganda\nThrow in Ireland schoolyard in South Sudan these little for libraries have\nOut and brown communities together\nPeople of course textbook spend a little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to think that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I

pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car\nSo that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and they want to put a book in there and you can share that limit reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he said that to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing than being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for community
