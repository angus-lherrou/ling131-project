public purpose she has some suggestions about how we might read value our work today and in the future\nThen on technician health Tim Shannon from Keenan partners explains the new drug potential a protein degradation and chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft describes recent FTA approvals in the area of a high\nProfessor Mariana ... new book the value of everything reminded me that I often ask people from students to academics to business people what's the value exchange here and right away they think I'm asking exclusively about money\nWhat I argue in my book is precisely that which is we unfortunately have confused value with prices and first of all this was a recent this hasn't always been the case in economics\nA classical economists actually focus first on value and they tied at two objective conditions of production just think back to Adam Smith the focus on the division of labor\nUm the pin factory example that he had where you know when you just have one person making every bit of the pin it takes this amount of time when you have lots of different people who are specialized who are producing that object I'm with the increase division of labor that increases productivity which is a key driver growth which is a key driver of the wealth of nations\nAnd also Karl Marx focused a lot on mechanization transformation of production innovation what she thought it was a key attributes of capitalism versus ...\nAnd both of these kind of folk eye on objective conditions then turned into their understanding of how exchange occurred the first I had a theory of value\nAnd that transformed into a theory of price where we have today we focus on prices we focus on the exchange and think that somehow that reveals value and so you have this absurd situation where someone like\nLloyd Blankfein the CEO of Goldman Sachs one year after the crisis\nTwo thousand nine after Laymon went bust\nYou had the nerve to say with a straight face Goldman Sachs workers are the most productive in the world\nAnd you could say that because it's true how we actually measure value based on prices if they are the ones who are paid the most [laughter] that's the price of their labor that must actually reveal their value\nI'm fascinated by the fact that you say this is recent that price determines value is a recent concept\nSo I focus on the way that economists have thought about this so I don't go in to value in terms of the ethics and the morality behind that that's really subject for philosophers and I'm very interested in that but that's definitely not my\nArea I focus on the way that economists themselves have thought about value and that has absolutely changed over the last four hundred years [laughter] and uh we shouldn't forget that economists have huge power unfortunately over how policymakers thick\nOr just like other you know a investments made have actually succeeded Tesla was actually also government financed initially with an equivalent size alone just under five hundred million and so the government itself for every Tesla probably will have to bear with two or three cylinder is\nFor every Internet might have to bear with two or three Concord planes which today are seen as failures 'cause they're not fine [noise]\nUm and so of course the government has no guaranteed rate of return it's also a risk taker workers are also risk takers they might accept a job thinking that they'll have a lifetime career and maybe except to have a lower salary than they would like 'cause they think they will rise up through the ranks there's no guarantee for that\nRight so you actually have different types of risk takers different types of value craters and these companies and unless we have a real from understanding of how value it's created collectively by different stakeholders\nThen we end up with these problematic ideas about shareholders being the only risk taker is the only value craters and what you get is the justification for the profits and the revenues of these companies to basically be siphoned off\nTo a narrow group of doctors who have been part of the process but not the only ones and that reads any quality\nYou are listening to tech nation I more again in my guest today is Mariano much Cato detrimental ... is a professor and the economics of innovation and public value and University College London where she directs the Institute for innovation and public purpose she's here today with her book\nThe value of everything making and taking in the global economy\nYou talk a lot about the difference between value creation and value extraction let's put that we've been touching on it but let's put some simple words to those so that when people see something they can see the difference\nSo first I Would take away any normative judgment on whether what we're talking about as good or bad you know you could even be talking about fracking which some people think is that the forget whether we like what's being finance but value creation is basically\nThe use of time and effort energy to create basically new\nAnd or improved goods and services which would include public services new types of health care and you know better education\nValue extraction is moving around existing assets existing goods and services and basically charging money for the control under a bridge just across the bridge to get a fee what has a troll done nothing [laughter] Adam Smith called this theft he said that the landlords of the time who were really seen as the the\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by FHM preventing miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November report that the patron or for your theater at the gym at ... dot com\nValue and one is extracting value the next step is really to say whether the proportion of rewards that are being on whether it's by the tech companies the large banks hedge funds it's proportional to what they'd actually done\nSo it's not to say that say the banks aren't doing anything they might have a very important role in the value creation process for example financing being you know a enabling certain companies to receive the kind of finance they might need to take off\nAnd the market but is the return being burned by say the investment banks or those who are creating the hedge funds or\nThe metric capitalists themselves as we're speaking in San Francisco today are getting a reward that its disproportionate to what they've actually done and if you don't have a deep understanding of the different collected actors who have contributed to well there's a really strong possibility that we don't allow\nThis narrow group of doctors to disproportionately burn and get these massive cash piles as for example we definitely seeing the tech community\nCompared to what they've actually done so in other words what we have is a problem with the story telling behind the success of many of these companies we tell only one part of the story we even you know mythology eyes the role of entrepreneurs whether it's Steve Jobs ... mosque and if we're not telling the full story\nAnd if economic theory isn't able to tell the full story of all the different actors including the public actors including the labor force which actually contributed to the success\nOf these very wealthy companies then we're going to have a huge problem and making sure that the wealth that's created is shared just as much as the value was created require different types of actors taking risks\nNow uh you do talk about a Silicon Valley you talked about Wall Street and you talked about big pharma pharmaceuticals we know that the drug manufacturing portion obeys the laws of technology it gets better faster cheaper [noise]\nRecognizing this you're proposing a new economic model so that we can develop pharmaceuticals and we can not only move the value around two creators and the people who are actually making all this\nBut we can also delivered the pharmaceuticals to the people who need them at an appropriate cost let's just talk about that model sure\nWe actually have a report that's coming out in a couple of weeks are funded by the open society foundation which actually proposes exactly how to do that we call it a mission oriented health innovation model what is the challenge actually why do we have all this government money going into a process without actually\nAdequately and strategically thinking about what is it that were actually financing what kind of health care system you could consider from a public actress point of view which is not trying to maximize profit but trying to maximize Republican social value that you would have to have a strong idea\nOf what are the characteristics of the health system that you want to be guiding these different types of public and private investments\nRight so that is often missing and I would call that the sort of directional push what is the mission what are we really trying to do what are we really trying to do here and you can and bringing the private sector which of course we'll experiment and explore with you but perhaps it might be better to do it through say a price system\nThat you could say look we really need to find solutions to these kinds of diseases here's a prize this amount of money for those companies that actually come up with a solution\nVersus putting in all the money and then allowing the price system itself\nThe prices of the drugs to be the way that we incentivize the pharmaceutical companies to enter that space 'cause then what you get as what we saw where the c._e._o. of a pharmaceutical company called nostrum pharmaceuticals\nIncreased the price of an antibiotic by four hundred percent and antibiotics or central Madison's when he was asked how can you do that how can you increase the price of such an essential drugs that people are required to live by four hundred percent he said I had a moral imperative\nTo do that in order to please my shareholders\nAnd so the question is you know if we are going to allow a pharmaceutical industry to do that then there shouldn't be any public funds going into it if you want to allow the pilot pharmaceutical industry to be producing these drugs and to be studying any price they want literally\nWhat the market will bear then why are we putting public money into it if you are going to be putting public money into it and then the U.S we spent over thirty billion dollars a year by the national institutes of health\nOn pharmaceutical and biotech research then of course both the characteristics of how the health system if you want is being shaped but\nAlso of course the prices of the drugs should reflect that public contribution so you know the taxpayers paying two or three different times they're paying for the research they're paying for these very high prices and they're also paying for different types of welfare state institutions to come in and subsidize\nThose drugs for the pie that pharmaceutical companies the Medicare Medicaid here or in the u._k. where I live the national health service\nAnd it's just a very inefficient system and it hurts both the rate of the nation because there's lots of waste but also the direction of innovation innovation has not just rape\nButter

gun industry Smith a long time and animal models of of disease and we still use those but what really sick is transformed or abilities are human genetics you know really the foundation's being on the human genome project\nWhich are unfolding about Twenty years ago and then the knowledge has come from the human genes in ... been disease sex is real strong validation of what's wrong and the disease much better notion of what's wrong disease then we\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... rpm theater at ... dot com\nAs an animal biology so again in just to spend a long time and animal models of of disease and we still use those but what really I think is transformed our abilities are human genetics you know really the foundation's being in the human genome project\nWhich unfold in about Twenty years ago and then the knowledge has come from\nThe human genes impact than disease sex is real strong validation of what's wrong in the disease much better notion of what's wrong disease than we had pre genetics\nAnd not let us know where to go so it increases the likelihood of us have been able to target a real important part of the patients disease and impact is going to successfully to me that's a real big change\nOver the past Twenty years in the way we approach developing drugs for a ...\nOne thing that I noticed is that used to be like one disease suddenly becomes a multiple variations on a theme and then within that multiple variations kind of thing the whole number of diseases you could have has expanded magnificently before I\nWrite and and and they're all smaller because of that so one diseases become thousands diseases and the you know the prime example is cancer we talk about cancer that's one word it's\nFive or six letters six letters I guess but boy it's a lot of different things\nSo again I think part of our limitations are one with we simplify things than we simplify things like cancer and we've done that historically because we didn't have really a strong underlined understanding of of the complexities of diseases\nAnd again we really have scientifically broken diseases down into much smaller entities but much more specific entities were again you know the the whole idea behind precision medicine\nWhere if you can really understand a particular type of cancer in particular patient you can treat that cancer very well may not have helped all cancer patients but that's a population of patients you can really target and really have a big impact\nAnd that's really been again a big change\nOver the past twenty or Thirty years and that will continue um this whole trend toward personalized medicine personalized therapies will be a really strong going or\nWell since I haven't even in front of me I Want to ask you a couple of ... bats couple of terms I'd been hearing capital concepts had been hearing one focus had there not protein degradation ... yeah\nNo that's that's a real interest that's a whole new type of drug I'm so just to take a step back most of the drugs that have been developed a things we call inhibitors of proteins\nSo their drugs that many proteins bind a thing called the light in and they changed that lying into something else that is where an enzyme does it takes one thing and changed something else so most of our drugs\nThat have been developed so far as things that blocks the activity that enzyme and they usually do by mimicking the substrate it usually convert so they come up the engine of that\nWe've got very good at that but the problem is there only so many enzymes to drug there are very small portion of all the disease targets\nProtein degradation is a different approach so you all you need with protein degradation you don't need to block up a function you you just need to tag a protein and you trick the cell into chewing up that protein and getting rid of it\nSo getting the cells have a normal mechanism to a quality control proteins within it and that that can\nPoint to the ...\nRight so the cell usually does that has its own ... called the ... zone\nAnd protein degradation tricks to sell into thinking it should get rid of something that it otherwise wouldn't get rid of so now if you have something causing cancer you can use a drug to trick that cell into degrading that thing that's causing cancer\nSo you can go after a whole different class of protein targets and things like cancer and other diseases\nAnd get rid of them and deal with them in ways that traditional drugs haven't been able to do so it opens a whole new field and all you can go after a whole different set of inter cellular targets with that\nI mean in the past it kind of the wholesale because any of the ... if they're ... you don't have to do right\nSo this this is a way to very specifically go after a particular protein that's causing the patients disease and just trick to sell into getting rid of it through its own mechanisms of of of chewing up proteins\nSend now for your next chair of getting very well at that they have nothing to give you ... if I had a nice tote bag my actually my ... but that's that's how we can get lettuce synthetic lethality\nVery interesting concept so again this this gets back into taking advantage of the kill the heels of cancer cells so I think is you know cancer cells come about through these patients\nAnd they developed lots of them so those are changes in DNA that result in changes in proteins and some of those proteins become hyperactive and Dr cancer cells but a lot of the mutations don't have any function they just create proteins that are non functional\nThose non functional um proteins can cause a stress on the cell and again the cell has to get rid of those they can also causes stress on the DNA so for years cancer cells to divide your DNA has to be attacked and when these mutations occur in DNA that causes stress\nThe cells again have a normal systems are perished in a way\nThat has been your normal cells your cancer cells rely on that because they have so many abnormalities DNA if they don't have this repair mechanism tack on fact die\nSo sympathetically Sally is a situation where a patient has a certain mutations that then you take a drug and you literally block DNA repair it in that sell so that it can no longer\nRepair it in that sell so that it can no longer to deal with mutation load in those cancer cells and the cancer cells will die of pushes them over and too stressful situation so it's actually taking advantage of mutations that a cancer cell to tip a cancer cell over into a death pass because they can't deal with this mutation\nSay you want to mutate we'll help yeah\nRight exactly so it's playing right into what the cancer cell does better over loads that and it can't deal with it again at ... cancer cells ride a very fine line and this just tips them over where they actually can't survive because it's too much ...\nNow the last one I Want to ask you that I don't have a term for that it's a it's a new a new insisted fibrosis remind us what cystic fibrosis says and I think you know what I'm Talking about [laughter]\nSo against ... fibrosis is a disease I'm you know it starts at birth and um it's a disease of\nThe lungs predominantly also affects them or other organs but the lungs are really like get people into trouble so it's a disease and something called a a a protein in a cell that transports chloride into your airway\nSo your airways ... bears going in and out of your breathing tubes nose breathing tubes are lined with mucus\nAnd things called ... which are little hairs and the mucus catches things that are going into your lungs and the silly helps push them back out of your lungs so bacteria on your lungs that got expelled\nThat requires the mucus to be a very particular hydration level so it can move freely and if it's to dry it gets rock solid\nSo it needs water and cystic fibrosis is a channel blocked that I'm ... chloride into the airway and waterfalls chloride so that's a ways that water gets into the air way to keep it hydrated\nAnd cystic fibrosis that gene doesn't work for that protein so chloride doesn't go into the airway in water doesn't go into the er way there's another channel and cystic fibrosis that does the same thing with sodium\nSo it's a sodium channels that keeps sodium in the airway and if you keep sodium in the airway water will send our way so solving changed a lot also tracks water and that's what keeps the mucus hydrated\nSo we we have a company that is so the company ... taxes worked on this the FDR and I had made nice improvements in patients CF really groundbreaking um we this week in Europe\nHave a company called ... biosciences for the first time looks like they've been successful in modulating this this sodium receptor called ... up there\nIn a way that improves lung function in patients in Sussex cystic fibrosis so this was the first study impatience [noise] and it looks like it has a positive outcome on on their lungs in terms of restoring normal airway hydration and again as a way to improve lung function improve on health\nSo it's it's you know again it's back to these very precision medicines I understand the jak bases disease and targeting them there's been great progress and cystic fibrosis I'm along the doctor when I was in training back in the eighties cystic fibrosis patients slipped about the age of fourteen\nToday they reached is about thirty seven\nWhich is you know that's so more than doubled and in about twenty five years but again normal life expectancy is is eight years and that's where we'd like to try to get patients with cystic fibrosis\nI still remember my patience you know just begging to hurry therapies the market I'm just really difficult disease so it's really gratifying to see the improvements that are made and you know hopefully this new job will be added to existing drugs and and really put patients on a path to longevity", "show_name": "no_show",
