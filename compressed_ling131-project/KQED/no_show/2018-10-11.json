severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKevin is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn said in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country have to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing they have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this\nCourt those efforts will now be supersized weekend said

here comes Michael Storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today with gusts of a hundred fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerged weeks after the storm is passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington U Haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate\nMoving on a boat out where to go ahead\nGary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can't find new housing for them the apartment owner is giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash but Moore says that won't go far\nWe're ... and they're not as a matter of fact I looked at all the name of the month of able to do it at all like the Olympic runner a\nMore his girlfriend's Harris who kings sits in a chair and by the front door her head in her hands I'm stressed out\nIf anything the red cross here says about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back schools that sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe close during a hurricane we actually opened back up to date for the public after the hurricane um ...\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave up a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked at a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business I came in for a few\nDays to help with the cleanup process but other than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with that\nNeither business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck coming\nSmall businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless the business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced and you can't get them back so it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or or your business\nSeem a famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped it just proves that production but it's too soon to tell whether it's with the economy or housing some injury becomes apparent only as time goes by\nTom Gjelten NPR News Wilmington North Carolina
