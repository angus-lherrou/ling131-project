recently the pope's actually traveled to other countries that mess with tens of thousands in large athletic stadium\nAnd traveled over the Golden Gate bridge and through the city in his hope no bill

their photograph by thousands and the churches significant\nWritten instructions to Catholics everywhere are translated into multiple languages and published on the Internet the pope Francis is not entirely happy with all this\nYou see as Pope Francis is saying mass he looks out at the assemble edge and what does he see he sees smartphones held up by this embodied are holding them up above the crowd jockeying for an unemployed haired view a whole sea of them\nAnd why does this bother him\nBecause he's performing a sacred right\nIt's not a performance it's a religious ceremony he's saying mass for and with the people assembled it's intended they worship together the boy it's hard when you finally get close enough to someone who you never thought you would see in your whole life\nMy

[noise]\nTo tell you the truth is I think only a few will put their sons away but there's a real lesson here\nI used to take a lot of pictures on trips that I found myself spending all my energy taking pictures and not taking in the experience what do I feel what do I notice what does this remind me of what if I suddenly remembered what does this tell me about my life\nThe sheer ability of your mind to take you to other places and so many levels is enormous\nBut not if you're intensely engaged and taking pictures of everything\nEven if you set deliberate boundaries others you know that you take pictures and say take that what did you get that what any number of other related activities you don't want to be the photographer of your life you want to be delivered of your life\nStill I Can't get that image of the jumbotron out of my mind how soon thereafter the forty niners took to the field but images both still losing a fleeting\nAnd while it's great to return to them authentic experience these with you in a much more nuanced way I'm way over again this is five [noise]\nFive minutes is produced at the studios are picky weedy FM in San Francisco [noise]\nFive minutes is a production of technician media\nFrom San Francisco I'm Moira gun and this is technician\nToday on tech nation I think with Wired Science journalist match Simon connecting the animal kingdom from insects to Wales who's a parasite who's a host you a parasite and who might be controlled by one\nAnd then on technician health chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft talks about a remarkable experience than the owner of a smart watch it might be a telling glimpse into our futures [noise]\nWhen I started reading Matt Simon's book plight the living dead I made a quick list in terms of zombies mind controllers parasites and I thought let's start with parasites listeners know them listeners even believe they exist\nDo yeah all over the place and in fact uh some estimates say that more than half of life on this planet is in fact parasitic because it turns out to be\nA very great with about why if if you are I'm kind of stuck in the energy out of a host that might be a little bit easier as far as survival is concerned but ah as we get into in the book when you're earning a living in another animal if you're a worm or or something like that comes with all these\nReally interesting challenges a first of all not dissolving because of the hopes for immune system to pick one by being able to do these really intricate maneuvers where you might you know such a matter of energy to let your host actually keep living because you want it to keep suggesting but to reach that very fine line of\nGetting enough energy out of it to power your own body but not shut down the body of the house or you aren't happening\nSo the one definition of parasite might be a single feeder feed on you and you've got to ... to figure out all the things that you need to live and you know the brutality of of finding things to eat however that may come to you and that would be the definition of parents I\nGuess because yeah because there's a lot of different more technical definition but I think really just breaking it down a parasite as a as a creature that feeds off of the energy of\nThe animal with left on the outside like in the you'd see her sort of particles and things like that and wealth or within the whale itself you might have worms and in fact well forget much bigger than the worms and inhabit our bodies of of course but yes generally speaking into something that is sapping the energy out of another country\nBoy let's just go right there a worm inside a whale how big could a worm inside of well crafted\nThat's a great question so I was actually a couple of months ago a whale had washed ashore up up\nNorth of San Francisco here um I mean we're shutting undersized or they're they're like you want to come see the well before they had finished their email I was in the car to go see the well which by the way it puts out a smell of it is\nIndescribable it's very strange feeling 'cause it's like a\nPunch in of course but also rubies our it's it's a very ... we're ... and he said the scientist there was showing me around the well it took me up and down and well and that's where the scent changes so the closer you get to say the intestines\nUm you get of course the intestines smell of the ways but also just pure blood smells more like iron it's like the symphony of smells you walk around and say it is it will actually stick to you if you like I got my car when you're done I haven't touched\nAnything no wrong well or anything I can still smell it on myself it in a car ride home which was\nLess than pleasant but so when we're looking at this well they were doing the autopsy and and one of the scientist actually pulled out a lot of these worms they were big sizable robust worms\nWe're sitting here on the radio and it was that ... to part I'm doing\nSizable robust worms\nI Can't imagine how they figure that\nYeah there's a these are really fantastic researchers here and they just must they must go through records central crises are [laughter] I'm just looking at this really terrible thing and it's really nature is it's a horrible like\nIf we're really lucky to not be out there we mostly remove ourselves from the food chain nothing is is joining us much anymore I don't know if we're lucky but they're really really terrible things going on out there with with parasites by you know this is the way life goes the that's these are our judgments of course as humans but um this is the way that evolution has\nDesigned things not not purposely of course but\nJust by chance this is the strategy involved in this Joel Boston unfortunately for the cockroach that mean exemplified hollowed out and then\nYou're listening to technician I'm way right down in my guest today is matched signed that science journalists at wired magazine you might know him from his earlier puck\nThe boss that brainwashed the caterpillar he see the game with the plight of the living dead like we'll license zombies reveal that our world and ourselves\nFrom that this is just fascinating I fifty to [laughter] to tell you I think people are very ... the idea of parasites in some place else but the idea that something could get into ass or even into our brains how\nHow was vulnerable which you say humans are to the the cruelest parasites that you're talking about here\nYeah I think the the most famous one and I don't think many people think of this as a manipulate parasite but rabies is perhaps the most devious maneuver the parasite when it comes to human beings and of course other mammals um\nIt's you can find videos on line of people in the throes of of a rabies I'm a break and it's\nReally horrifying thing to watch it it's it's tough because you know that these people are suffering so terribly and innocent virus will inevitably claim the life so what's interesting here is that rabies didn't involve analogy\nUsually get from a dog\nThat yeah yeah I like that so but because we share mammalian brain with with\nThe other critters that instead of all to manipulate and and to be more specific what it does is it it gets into the brain is the nervous system I'm In and do some kind of rage it's um and that's to further the pursuit of the virus because what has also done is made the creature from the mouth so\nWhen the uh the the poor host bites on something it transmits that that parasite but it's also a what it does is manipulates used to be afraid of water so there's nothing you can find videos of people if you\nTry to give somebody who's suffering from um rabies very close to death they'll actually\nDo anything they can to get away from the water and that seems to be a ... from the parasite as well\nThat doesn't want you to drink water to wash out all that saliva where the parasite is sitting and that's the way it gets onto its next post and of course the most famous manipulation is the aggression which you you find them both in and you know raccoon dogs but also humans and it's it's\nI I think we probably don't think that as many people are parents I just because we think that our brains are better than that right where human beings\nWe are more highly evolved quote unquote which just as if not the case would like to think of ourselves as special but\nThis is still tissue in our heads that as manipulative if you can do certain things as a parasite to really change the behavior of your host and rabies is is perhaps the most terrifying sample that\nWell we've been talking about ... ... the fire is very popular today you know to have all these things where does that come in who's ... who's this and the fire\nYeah so um where we'll just start at the beginning of the the whole zombie thing um it it began as folklore um way back when but it didn't really take off in America into Hollywood got a hold of it\nAnd it seems to have come from rabies uh the there's there's some early literature and pop culture where you started seeing these out of control humans that are just not in control of their faculties they're they're mad and and uh there's there's something wrong with their brains and a\nRight to walk around in their hands arms yeah straight narrow skiffs and they're just a\nLittle bit goofy any you know it it really it's it's fiction um but it makes sense from a ... perspective you want to induce not only like the toughness that you have is gonna be a famous where you could cut off an arm or whatever legged keeps going keep coming at ya but that that aggression that's the parasite\nWanting to further itself and get to to a new host so it does seem that the um the myth of of the zombie was in fact\nInspired by race and that's what you get this whole range of of dumb as you have the lowest numbers of course but you also have the fast movers um and that's where you can start to think about what is it that much sense if you if you don't get technical on\nSponsorship of the cake weedy life's dream lighten the transit AC Transit connect the vibrant resilient and diverse members of the East Bay to the thing that drives them\nSpeech ... a part of the community learned more ... the transit dot org slash ride ACT\nBut these are interesting things that I as I mentioned earlier there's there's really considerations for a parasite within the body of the hosts not only create these behaviors that further it's genetic line but\nTo be able to survive in what is an environment that is very much willing to attack you to destroy us best is awesome but can\nWe see this a lot where what are the things all these parasites do is they take on that the immune system and sending out paralyzed or trick yet says that it's not being attacked [noise] yeah\nIt's really it's it's a strange one and it's\nLot of times it seems to be the parasite like worms we haven't chopping there about the ... which are often on his horse hair worms they have an interesting why cycling through they crawl into crickets and then my control them to jump into water um which is bad news for the cricket you don't want to be doing that but at that point that the\nThe worm can tell because it's it's cut a little hole in the cuticle of the abdomen you can actually taste when it has hit water and then it scrambled out of the cockroach in really horrifying passionate and went to a lab that does this and this is a scientific fantastic you you'd normally find one\nWorm per cricket out in nature but in his lab he's done dozens sometimes like in fact to them and dozens and almost every time the cricket survives space strange even though like if if it can survive drowning\nAnd it can survive a mass of worms ... out of its by something on the Internet if you so wish to to look up you can find it it's pretty\nPretty terrifying but that the the trick there on that when it gets in to the cricket it forms a list of sorts and that seems to I'm confused immune system you system can't find it there is some sort of material that the worm is using to hide essentially and the cricket um and which crazy about this one is\nThat if it ends up in a host the cricket is what it wants to venture that but if it ends up in some other kind of insect it'll insist itself in that insect and if it gets eaten by a cricket\nCan actually tell when it isn't the right ... yeah oh this is exactly where I wanted to be\nUm and then only then would come out of that this form and turn into worm and begin feeding on the juices inside the cricket which point and mix it jumped into the water um kamikaze style so there there's yes it's a tough life we want to think of parasites as freeloaders but who they are\nStruggling my idol because it's that those bodies want to destroy them in any way that can\nI've been speaking with Wired Science journalist ... in the book is place as the living dead what real life it's somebody's reveal about our world and ourselves we'll talk more after break [noise]\nTied Cass Tech nation and techniques shut down All right NPR wind I can get your podcasts syndication by coming out in the second half of our shell I technician health chief tier I signed that Dr Daniel craft\nTalks about one person's remarkable experience thanks to me is my\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nBut whether it's dealing with a cockroach which is twice its size by controlling it better like this that actually might be able to provide more food affords young much bigger pray item um which would in theory Dr evolution of this more complex behavior to be able to really lead it around on a leash so it's\nThere are reasons that things evolved in a given ecosystem but there's that randomness of the mutations in our bodies that are are naturally happening that might better suit you just very slightly fewer environments\nThat are are naturally happening that might better suit you just very slightly your environment and by doing that you may be able to make more passed on the genes that code for that sort of a little bit ally beer or character\nYeah I like the ones didn't those genes just didn't come down and it's\nWhen you think about there's some fish that release something like five hundred thousand eggs in the water in a God female will drop half a million eggs and in a stable\nA population to will survive to replace their parents to I'd have five hundred thousand those odds are garbage [laughter] we of course as you must have a different tack we don't have five hundred thousand young and and hope that one or two survive\nOr we take care of our our young of course but a ... there's just so much suffering and terrible and this and it's something that Wallace and Darwin very much understood but we're a little bit afraid to to push on the public because back in the current times I was the one look\nAt those you have the religious aspect and\nFor so many people including scientists they can still see hand of God there if they believe God it's not a gift proof of that spirituality but of course you know they have more and more science when you have all of us know science and then some new framework comes in and\nIt's like that's a big leap to make that basically was the major rocking of the world that they had to pay for the law there is a backlash\nYeah I mean it is it's huge and it I mean probably the biggest part about it as as why harp on the book is that\nUnder the framework we humans aren't special we came from ancestors we're involved I'm just like everything else and it was by random is with the other the other narrative the more religious narrative is that we are placed on this earth because we're special um went above every other species which you know\nTechnically not rationing that down and write for the planet but we are our brains\nHave done something amazing in their evolution that that can't be doubted but what the argument I'm making is is that\nThese is it's still very much couched in in physical\nMatter and that produces not this nebulous soul or anything it's just neurons firing know transmitted bouncing around the brain and that's that's probably a little tough to to come to terms with I think when you want to think that humans are special were not\nHave to say when you read these things you ... it really adjust your thinking in total and tell them\nNo point across I only signed up by a nickel is just sit there and you talk about if you've mentioned the particles you know the ships initially on the ship but boy the goals and crabs what's the deal there [noise]\nYeah that's a tough that's a tough one to to talk about too because it's it's pretty gross [laughter] so yeah barnacles as you mentioned are they growing while they grow on ships I'm actually a nuisance for ships because it was some down\nUm this particle has adopted a rather more parents what is a particle you'll see among the beach of course of the things with the ... all sorts of shelves and below that as an actual critter that attaches itself to some sort of subject\nWhich is how most barnacles go about life um this market goes about why wait differently so it starts out really tiny as all particles do as a whole lot about um who wants to find a crap so when it actually gets insulted insider crowd this is a female\nUm she'll start growing as a root system throughout the crabs flash which sounds like the most painful\nAnd he's a ... like just working as her way through the entire like through the clause two legs growing throughout its system and it's a as she's doing that she is sucking up energy again the ways that parents can do this without completely wrapping their host of energy are are weighing down but somehow the\nCrowd is just like man seems so terrible in the sense that it's not producing a lot of weird behaviors um so what happens is a male barnacles has to find one not only a crab but a crab that has a female or in it and she kinda gross outside of its bomb area as a bomb\nUm since he has to find not only a female on a crab but a virgin female and when he gets there he enters into the crab\nThey get together um and they begin ... style\nAnd a very creative way I Would say to have sex and they started loosing offspring so um when the\nParticles are ready for this to happen the female actually orders the crowd to even if a male to male or female crab just start you're probably going to be like a crab ... it'd be like this was low surf it'll shake a bump to get all of its eggs out\nUm it was kind of dance and that's just jettison the eggs to get out in the ecosystem um\nThis isn't a crab\nFurther on its own genetic line whatsoever but it is the ... a parasite collapsing that behavior to then have the crab shake its own offspring out of it the perfect offspring that then go out into the ecosystem define their own crab\nUm but what's crazy there is as I mentioned doesn't matter if it's a male or female males don't do that shaking my head because they don't have eggs so where's that coming from like you could see that it's costing the female crabs behavior for reproduction at these enough it why would the males are we doing it in in addition\nTo mail if they if they take up residence in a male the mail that dance\nAnd not only that actually feminine ISIS the crab in a way I'm so that actually makes the bomb area grow wider\n'em to more looked like a female and that might actually be to give the parasite more room to grow on the surface to get bigger and stronger so lots of really intricate manipulations happening on his way but really hard to think\nOf the worst way to go as far as a particle per se growing throughout your tissues and ordering you around the\nWell to wrap that you make the point nature does not care about your feelings and wellbeing now that is for sure [laughter]\nWe have it so lucky in that mix considering all the other stuff that's happening [laughter] hey that thank you so much for coming in and help you come back and see if we can absolutely
