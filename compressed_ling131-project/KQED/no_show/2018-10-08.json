San Francisco cake Huey I north highlands Sacramento eleven o'clock\nComing up on technician the explosion of medical information and how it could have worked for us in the future I speak with Dr Eric shot the dean of precision medicine at the I can food medicine at Mount Sinai and the founder\nAnd CEO of them before then on technician health a vaccine to treat Alzheimer's and potentially prevent it\nStuck to your age a Vermont from United neuroscience tells us about how and why it might work then chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft tells us about the age ways of this coming up on this week's technician\n[noise]\nLet's take five with more regard it's five minutes\nYears of great my credit card got stolen story\nI went to Mexico and upon arriving at the airport picked up my rental car from a major company I use that credit card that one and only one time [noise] several days later I started getting text from my credit card company called beforehand and informed that was going to Mexico\nThat charge there the charge that the answer was no no no and no called the fraud representative and we cancelled the card and determined it would be to ... percent to send me a new card since it had to go through customs we decided to simply mail it to my home in San Francisco\nAnd I would validate it when I returned [noise]\nAnd as I was literally packing another flurry of fraud alert text messages regarding charges in Mexico appeared on my phone but my digits were new to me and they were the numbers on the new cart gas charges again\nAnd no no no again when I called the credit\nCard company I told them that the new card was sitting on\nMy mailbox back\nAnd I certainly hadn't activated I didn't even know the numbers on the card I\nCouldn't have used it to charge anything in Mexico or anywhere else for that matter\nAnd there it was plain as day the credit card hadn't been stolen and Mexico but rather me to look like it was stolen there this was an inside job [noise]\nOne of the aspects that was so slick about this experience was that the fraudsters knew where I was and then I rented a car charges came from gas stations one for a hundred and fifty dollars and another for two twenty five\nNot insignificant to the untrained eye totally appropriate\nOf course at church the airfare so they knew about that too upon reflection it took context to make the charges believable and then I remembered that I had called the credit card company in advance\nAnd they had due to flee entered one I Would leave and return the where was the leak\nGood question you would need all the data to hazard a guess think about it what does it take to connect the dots and make realistic charges who had what data how did they get it how did they piece it together and what they do [noise]\nA human point of view it wasn't so surprising that the first credit card had been stolen but the second cars being stolen sprang up very loud bell\nHow do you steal a credit card that the owner has received yet the presumption on the part of the fraudsters was at the new card had been delivered standard operating procedure it was the very without a doubt\nBut it went the extra mile to make it look like other people did it send the fraud investigators off in the wrong direction and if there's one level of interaction\nWhy not others some pretty helpless\nLevel of interaction why not ethics [noise]\nSome pretty helpless and wondering what consumers I Do about it you and I felt like the answer with not much\nOther than to participate fully when you get a notification of potential fraud your personal experience Jeff might crack the king [noise]\nYes this was a cat and mouse game All right we're rather a card game can't [noise] I'm ... again it's five minutes [noise]\nFive minutes is produced at the studios of cake you weedy FM in San Francisco [noise]\nFive minutes of the production of technician media [noise]\nFrom San Francisco I'm a lawyer again and this is technician\nToday on technician what happens to all that medical data we've accumulated over time and will be accumulating from here on out\nI speak with Dr Eric shot the dean of precision medicine at the eye can school of medicine at Mount Sinai and the founder and CEO of semi for\nThen on technician health work on a vaccine to treat and potentially prevent Alzheimer's Dr AJ Vermont than United neuroscience talks about their efforts and chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft tells us about the age wave it's about to break\nOver our lives we've all had plenty of blood tests X rays now genetic tests and more with technology the information about our health status is growing quickly\nI asked Eric shocked the founder and CEO of ... before we get that grocer the information means\nThe growth of information means you know first of all the digital University of data has grown up with such speed you know that we're now we're up to you know is that a bite of data seem to be a Yoda bite of data which is so\nUnimaginably other like yeah it's yeah I was you know and Star Wars I had to look that went up because they had no idea what came out ... you know tear a pedal bike in what you saw in the field\nOf medicine in particular is we went from ... to settle bites skipped right over ... like nobody even heard of that [laughter] but so it's so it's a such data built up around you you mentioned some of the sources but think about the iPhone\nOr other smart device you carry with you and the GPS coordinates and that those GPS coordinates or sample that high frequency over time and they've Lincoln the geographic information systems\nThat have things like what's the temperature and the pollen counts and the traffic flow and the electricity usage and on and on and on just these really holistic profiles that can be built up around you and interpret you know what's happening in the environment that you're existing in and how might it explain\nSome of the um things you have going on with you or whether it's I feel tired all the time or I'm having allergy problems or I or even even have abnormal test results up my physician can now be more and more accurately predicted you know from this data that can be built up around so it means both\nBetter insights into what's happening with you and better ability to predict a but it also means\nOr remove all of of any kind of privacy because all of this data built up around you uniquely identifies you any high dimensional sets of data that exist around you are very very specific to you\nYou're the only one in this body walking\nAround this way you're pattern of a walking speed your gate a wet stories you visited with food\nHow you use your phone how you use your phone if you have access to somebody else to use your phone and he gave it to your sons saying you know I don't need this anymore fella immediately it would be very simple to analyze it it is not you using that found you got it it is somebody else\nYou got it you know so it's a [noise] you know definitely a brave new world of sorts where we don't either have our heads around you know what all can this data\nHow do you relate to that area [laughter] yeah this is ... think about all of this\nWell it's a it's one of the things we hope to change is this this idea in medicine today we treat diseases is very black and white it's either you're sick or you're not sick and that as we know is not true right diseases occur on a continuum spectrum\nAnd you're either always moving towards that state or you're in a while state and you're able to resist a getting those diseases but the only way you can track something like that is to not be coming in and then they're ready to date I had to say\nThat\nEven when I hear well like just again even while individuals if you can well if you can\nLook at information around those well individuals and map out what trajectory are you really honor you on a trajectory that's going to resist all of these common diseases that played a lot of us or are you on a trajectory that's that's gonna be catastrophic in five years time like if you do not balance off that path\nYou're going to have lots of problem will both the while individuals wanna know am I not only am I on a good path but how do I stay on that path like what are the right kinds of interventions like what are the right\nKinds of foods are exercises or what drugs shouldn't I tape because I'm more sensitive I'm going to have an adverse event like all of that information or can be leverage to say how do you maintain a a more well more robust\nA state of wellness so I think it applies to both like they're all in this continuum in in the push has to be how do we get more probabilistic in our understanding of the these diseases not black and white binary as if you just one day had a heart attack and nobody saw that coming [laughter] you know we know that's not true\nOne event that happens and it said an advantage over months what event that happens too many lemon and sometimes multiple times in the course of their lives is pregnant say at the moment you become pregnant\nEverything changes he got he got ...\nWe really start that journey or before you were pregnant\nAnd that's ah everything from um assessing your current state of wellness so what are what are you at risk of even before you become pregnant\nOf complications that can happen in pregnancy so think gestational diabetes Priya clams preterm birth period natal depression all sorts of things can happen during her pregnancy and if you're better understand that risk\nAt the beginning you can better manage a that Journey Through through its course\nUm we also start with the genetics I'm like what are you as a mom and your reproductive health partner what are you at high risk\nYou know these kinds of diseases that if you knew you were at high risk you would um you know maybe a you know let the auto fertilization you would say okay I'm going to have these embryos fertilized and I'm going to pick the ones that don't aren't going to pass this disease on\n'em once you're pregnant your uh you know there's non invasive prenatal testing that that we do [noise]\nAnd again our whole aim as you know can we help I'm a woman you kind of manage that journey the information around her and again provide better insights into the risks are that that she'll be I'm exposed to three ... three that course\nAh and then even wants to babies born you know you have a depression related issues that can arise and they're even issues within the unborn child or the sorry Bora the newly born journal [noise]\nAh so think of a rare disorders or that sometimes don't manifest until your one or two if you could detect those up bird there's some conditions where if you knew them at birth you could give a an intervention that would lead to a normal life\nUm if they go one to two years when it clinically manifest you've lost twenty IQ points and you never getting those points back like so just being able to test at birth\nTo say you know do does my child have any condition that can be treated from day one\nOn like those are the sorts of things about the uh this technology is bringing to bear on on that pregnancy journey\nLet's say we have a patient I'll find that really wants to do this or we think pushback from ... [noise]\nAbsolutely so we it it it's a it's a mixed today or some of the things like the carrier screening I mentioned at the beginning or what you should be getting before you're becoming pregnant\nAnd the non invasive prenatal testing those are kind of standard of care or they very rapidly became standard of care you know probably three or four years ago the standard of care for carrier screening was like four to eight or diseases that are a\nProfessional bodies recommended a young today we're testing for for hundreds you know like it's moved really fast up but that's become rapidly standard of care because it's had such a positive impact on reproductive health choices about things like newborn screening definitely pushback on\nYou know a controversy around um [noise]\nYou know ... what are the advantages and disadvantages like what are the risks that somebody gets in having that information generated um if they are tested for a condition where you don't know exactly what to do to create things idea creates stress\nI'm you know is that a good thing or a bad thing and so there's lots of studies we and others are running to try to help figure out\nA but what I feel like as we can't ever had in the sand and pretend like this isn't happening like we\nWe have to engage um you know individuals in studies we have to engage a broader societies legislators regulatory bodies like we all have to kind of figure this out together I bet you're not going to stop it like it's a you mentioned twenty three and me ancestry like there are these consumer facing direct to consumer efforts\nWere you know there is no regulatory body involved it's yeah you you as a consumer can decide you want that information and you can submit that up to various Web pages and they'll give you interpretations like we we have to like that waves here and it's you have to figure out how to ride it or maybe help guide it\nUh but uh so that that's how we view it ended up the pushback we get as okay well let's work with you let's do carry out the right kind of study or or let's restrict\nWhat we report back to the only things where we can do something about it so we're not going to test you for are you at high risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's 'cause as a baby what are you going to do what you can do about that information\nUm but if you have a G six P. D. deficiency 'em knowing that at birth you all you have to do is change your diet and you won't get any of the clinical ah affects from that from that deficiency like something that simple\nIt's not tested for in in in newborn screening panels at the state level like why wouldn't you want to know that information so a lot of it is giving actionable information to the position where they know what to do\nAnd they can guide the patient on on what they can do\nWell Eric ... that ten years we don't have that kind of time [laughter]\nAnd sorry if I was ... I Know there's like a yeah cats you know catching it catch in which you're saying here ah but but we ... we're looking at here is a whole ... of information at ... and how it in ... and how we're supposed to relate to it and what we can do and all of that\nIt's all coming at it you know I've been saying like it's kind of an addict which it's finally\nHere here's really here so I Do hope you'll come\nBack in ... Oh thank you\nEric Scott is the founder and CEO of semi for more information is available at semi for dot com that's s e and a semi and then number for sending a far dot com you are listening to technician [noise]\nTied cats at ... nation in technician health are available and NPR One I can stick here and that's it\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Shepherd ...\nTalked about the age wave\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd so the whole effort had to be stopped\nI'm now mind you some people even though they stopped being does did fair pretty well compared to what they might you might expect and an autopsy or several of them you know showed evidence of amyloid being cleared from the brain so the idea was that this could work with you just get around a safety issue\nAnd what what our parent company did was figure out how to use a vaccine approach and just activate one arm or the immune system and it does it by sort of fooling the immune system into thinking you have an infection on board when you really don't\nWe actually make these little peptide his little bits of of proteins that sort of kind of look like passages that all humans are exposed to whether it's me\nSort of kind of look like pathogens that all humans are exposed to whether it's measles or something else it but they are engineered the artificial\nYour immune system gets tricked out there's something there that got to go after and mount a big response but when they go and interrogated there really isn't [laughter] that that one of the year ... but in the process by what we've attached to this construct\nWe we get the immune system to make lots of antibodies against whatever we have attached to this the steak [laughter] imagine if you will and that seems to work\nAnd it seems to be safe it doesn't launch what we call the psycho toxic T cell response which is what is the auto immunity that you see in multiple sclerosis and lupus and a bunch of others use\nThat as a place called uh the ... of these guys that don't worry about it in the meantime\nIt launched the anti pot right and\nAnd because it doesn't really rile up the immune system in a severe way like other vaccines would we don't leave a permanent memory\nMeaning this is not like a one and done in a lifetime lifelong now you have this immunity so that the we activate what's called the beef sell the arm of the immune system and when you do that those be souls proliferate and they die out over time\nSo after vaccinating someone and getting the antibodies level if we stopped dosing those levels will come back down over about you know eight months to a year now if we boost we can get it right back up again\nSo now we can scope the response and keep it elevated as long as we want depending on which disease and what we want to so it's a drug and we anticipate um after priming people in their first year which is really a a dose of the ... flu shots ran your arm just like you would get a muscle who shot\nAt baseline one month and three month and then after that we see our antibody levels rise around four months let's say\nAnd then this gently start to come down but if we boost people along the way we can keep it up\nAnd so we are testing various boost dosing frequencies like that\nAnd um you know so far seems to be safe we seem to be able to get good antibodies we think eventually what if we are successful in this becomes a drug this will probably be a like an annual booster so once a year you just read [laughter] you know re boost up your levels\nAnd you monitor I'd just like you'd monitored cholesterol or some other biomarker\nAnd hopefully it'll ward off disease that we have to actually prove this in early disease first\nBut are real hope is that we can do that will be safe and more pragmatic so that we can actually moved to prevention\nAnd what are the antibodies doing with respect to awesome [noise]\nWell it looks like I'm so anti bodies can neutralize some target that you and the math\nAnd we're used to them aiming at viruses and toxins and so and that's what the traditional vaccines do it looks like and what we're learning about nerd generation is that some normal proteins that do something good in your body your whole life\nLate in life or in the brain they tend to mis fold and accumulate as little aggregates that for some reason and the old days the brain has a harder time clearing out\nNow as they accumulate they really are these proteins when they when I say they become miss folded imagine a protein like a necklace then if you stretch it together it can it can have different shapes and show different sides of it [noise]\nUm some of the parts of the protein that are being shown in these aggregate your new they're not there and throughout your life so I actually look at them as sort of Neal antigens meaning it something new that your body never saw before [noise] so you might expect your immune system to go and take care of it yeah that's actually what was your immune system does when it sees things like that\nBut mind you this is happening in a time when your aging your immune system's weakening a bit and so maybe it doesn't do so well and some people and maybe a dozen other people\nIt could be that the immune systems actually taking care of this all the time in those people that don't get Alzheimer's people forget that most people don't ... and so what can we learn from them to help you know the less fortunate\nAnd it turns out that um the leading candidate um the leading antibody in the field is something that you can imagine being developed by ... and our immune that actually comes from an individual that somehow happened to have high levels of antibodies in dollars and ...\nAnd it did not have I'll send me\n... you know we don't know the identity of the subject but the the lower ... I I think is healthy subjective did very well that's why the the person was studied but lo and behold they happen to have high levels antibody so that's what that's the source of the drug actually it was actually engineered from such a person\nIs is that Henrietta Lacks' story and use it suddenly adding a layer ... an antibody yes\nSo it so it was a wonderful piece of science but it makes you wonder hey just happening all the time you know as your body of acts immunizing itself against these diseases and that's why some people don't get ill\nNow mind you most of the vaccinations we get in life are not from a vaccine that we get the doctors is just from getting the flu or the cold weather experiences in life we're getting back to an all time from the stuff that were exposed to an army and systems learning right\nAnd so really in a in a snapshot we're trying to teach the immune system how to learn better with a vaccine that's really what vaccines do they prepare you how do they get you ready for the real war that's you know you have to fight\nAnd um so that's in a nutshell our approach we think that these misquoted proteins or something that you should get rid of them in late life\nAnd we keep trading the immune system to do it\nNow is is just one bad thing you know everybody's focusing on beta amyloid um it's clear that that's a target from the genetics those people that happened to have certain mutations will get Alzheimer's if they have those particular mutations\nBut that may be the only thing that that may be what kicks off the whole you know fire then maybe they can link basically but later on and disease they may be other proposals\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford dot edu\nWorking on combination therapies I guess multiple mis fold proteins against and not only amyloid but office in New clan chow so we have a combo vaccine with all three for example like the adult in a more so magic when you're forty five you know getting a combo\nThat actually that again with that we were ... we were kids you have [laughter]\nAnd then that keeps you know it was ... when you were kids who was against these viruses and ... things but later in life maybe this dodging as things that we can vaccinate against so we've we're excited about this approach\nWell ha thank you so much for joining us help you come back and practice again my pleasure thank you\nDr ... is the chief medical officer of United neuroscience more information is available at United neuroscience dot com\nWhether it's Alzheimer's or any number of diseases in conditions I started hearing a new term the age wait I asked chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft looked at me\nAnd I think the term age wave was coined by my friend can die called who sort of an expert at looking at the lens of an aging where it is and and where it's heading it's implications and uh the point of baby boomers are now reaching age sixty five and beyond I think is it's about a quarter of already reached it and many more are getting to that point\nUm and can often makes the point that\nAh of those over age sixty five who ever lived over sixty five two thirds were alive today and that is only growing [laughter] that was asked but actually but make sixty five exactly ... who are sixty five don't take of themselves as old that my mom used to be in the old number because it was sort of picked out in the Eighteen eighties by\nMy Bismarck as sort of the age for\nA actuarial tables when folks would start to get a pensions\nBut at that point in the Eighteen eighties uh uh you know the average life expectancy was still you know mid forties\nSo we need to potentially as technology evolves our ability to\nAge smarter and live better you know what is old is that just a measure of of months on the calendar or parts of my biology and then what are the implications as we have this age wave coming in terms of the marketplace society or how we service and\nUm [noise] treat the older population and connect them to the younger lots of implications there is as a society gets older\nWell it seems to me if they're living longer and longer and longer we don't have a lot of scientific data for a whole big group of people that live that long that's true it takes a long time\nTo do the clinical trials and that you keep losing people having your own ads yet show [laughter]\nAnd even in medical school or you know I wouldn't stand for the most places there's very little focus on let's say gerontology steady or the care of the aged when most of our medical dollars a is focused on the last few years of life\nAnd in fact there was a ... probably a shortage of of of gerontology and in both internists or", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "08"}
