here is one well remembered moment from the nineties I take you back\nTo president almost president at this point Bill Clinton\nYou answer that question is a number of groups that were not with the New England I wound up and I didn't like that and didn't inhale and never tried it again\nBill Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two a deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale it Oxford was probably true because he knew firsthand their Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible\nForeign password Hitchens used to say he was no friend Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nA Bill Clinton's answer was lampooned at the time it's still remember now\nTwenty six

us ... when a\nYou can email us one a at W.

time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info sessions will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford ...\n... is one of the reasons why I today and nonpartisan\nUp Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting might sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham\nBack during the impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager\nHe helped impeach Bill Clinton and then went before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended Kavanaugh he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve\nHears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker that the Republican controlled house you're smart\nYou know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are\nDead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quick to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party in the future meeting Republicans had Joe broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham ... in the Trump beer SAT you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it tells me that the divide is deepening any\nIdea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with sense they're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election unless a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called them a bunch of things um in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand\n... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he is he converted what's he think I mean look\nThere's and there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that ... that that jump out at me what is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his in during popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're a Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also this theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he has a golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party would go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was a narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that\nAnd how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well\nWhat he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be and political science they those voters who go and they\nWere Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot just election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization the tribalism\nLet's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are I'm allegedly did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have\nA when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen who was willing to to find the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner speaker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house\nIf you are saying to me the euro postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but get it back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at uh the well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill yeah there there in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play you\nMay say well what was the big deal the deal was Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet or just you know that that was how deep in the minority they worry here was Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nI was always kind of waiting for the moment when I got a job that I I I kind of late at night after\nPressures on young dancer in movement in um [noise] I'm Sasha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls and Ross Perot was out in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent in just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteer submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said\nAfter Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well we won't be doing anything like that in our city hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that when went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people\nGoof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not that's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now manage media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality of Iraq Obama\nHad a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully um Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than\nThan maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public\nHas changed just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home\nAnd I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich in that moment with O'Neill what that moment came from with Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time with the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGifts his name was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump or to dump Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter Donald Trump identified through Twitter\nAway to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media as well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with C SPAN in Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there\nWell let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his ahead for all of them I guess he's an anti Semite he doesn't like the blacks who doesn't like the gays I I I it's just incredible that\nAnybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and there'll be a really staunch right wacko vote I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a lack of and I just can't imagine that anybody can take them seriously", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "05"}
