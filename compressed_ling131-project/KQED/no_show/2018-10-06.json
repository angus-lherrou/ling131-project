Berg an extraordinary moment of former justice saying that about a nominee\nWell what he said was that because Kavanaugh had framed his entire critique at his the second round of hearings as a partisan attack not just on Democrats but I'm liberal groups and I'm like liberal activists\nThat all those people when they come to the Supreme Court\nCould rightly maintained that they won't get a fair and unbiased hearing from him and you saw Brett Kavanaugh today the wall Street Journal tried to walk back is what he said call his emotional comments but he didn't say specifically which ones in any event Steven's point was that uh\nThat he might have to recuse himself now I think that's a they're highly unlikely\nPossibility given Kavanaugh's demeanor and how does\nThat happen also that of justice accuses himself or herself\nIt usually happens when there's a set of rules you know that say you're supposed to recuse yourself if you have any financial interests if your family is involved in any remote way if you're some very close friend has some financially or something like that there's a whole set of cannon set of ethical conduct but\nBecause the Supreme Court is the last place to go and if you recuse yourself there are only eight and they could be tied\nUm the justice has tried very hard not to have those conflicts\nYou can't take back a conflict like this and and I doubt that he's going to bow out out of a lot of if any cases because of what he said\nTom gold seen President Trump has had a number of rallies where people chant lock her up about Hillary Clinton and Brett Kavanaugh I got up there a before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge\nAre before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge on behalf of the Clintons could he be a an impartial judge in a case that involved the Clintons or left wing group he pointed out left wing groups as well well Clinton's might\nBe a very special case a given also his involvement with Ken Starr investigation in terms of\nThings involving liberals and conservatives and yet there's I think zero percent chance that he is going to recuse himself it would be in in essence an admission that he can't be neutral in the fraud issues like abortion affirmative action same sex marriage and the like I can see him doing that I think that\nWhat he is likely ... Jews probably try and find some opportunities are like he has recently with the editorial that he wrote to try and ask for some sympathy from Republican understanding exactly kinds of pressure that he was under and when he was feeling in terms of how his family was\nUnder the spotlight with these attacks and try and kind of walk back the sense that he has some active partisan and get back into the mode where in his original testimony when he first came before the the committee and really gave us this era of being a truly neutral arbiter of questions that come in front of him\nI Want to go through some key issues here that people are thinking about as they contemplate what Kevin I Will mean for the Supreme Court abortion first of all Nita what do you think this is going to mean for the issue of abortion\nWell I think it's pretty clear that at at least\nThere are five justices on the court who now will begin to whittle away at abortion rights they may not overtly reverse roe versus Wade\nBut we could end up in a situation in which in those states where abortion is ... that that abortion rights are are popular they remain and in those states where they are highly unpopular they not there's no longer a clinic there because they can't function under the rules that are laid down by the state law\nWhat about same sex marriage a Justice Anthony Kennedy a who is retiring or did retire or authored that decision Tom Goldstein about same sex marriages that issue going to come up against\nWell I don't think in terms of whether there is a right to same sex marriages would be very surprising to see the court\nKind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just playing the joints\nWhere you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise of the right who knows what that means you can fill into that whatever it is you want almost and that's why I'm more conservative court can allow more state regulation but there is a right to same sex marriage is a binary light switch on light switch off thing I Can't see them doing it\nWhere there isn't necessarily a right to is\nAll kinds of things that go with it it's like a king you require the floors to is against same sex marriage to design\nA floral arrangements for your wedding or as we saw a ... a cake wedding cake or a photographer to take photographs or go to the photography studio and have them develop photograph of your same sex wedding\nI mean most states have laws that require\nEqual treatment of everybody you can't just pick and choose who your customers are as long as they behave themselves\nBut their ... you know so far that remains the law of the land as it is but unless Congress were to pass\nA federal statute requiring equal treatment of um same sex couples for example it's not necessarily true that that would remain that would be true everywhere\nRight one thing that you're likely to see is a Supreme Court that's more sympathetic to religious objections\nTo doing things for example involving abortion or same sex marriage and like the county clerk who doesn't want to provide a marriage certificate that sort of thing the core right maybe there but the things that actually also help same sex couples really feel like they're equal maybe more in question\nWhat about the issue of presidential power President Trump is currently under investigation that Robert Mueller investigation is going on ... will will cabin are being on the court make any difference there\nWell we we know that he has said things that are at least ... at least questioned the correctness of than famous Nixon tapes decision which would which required to print President Nixon to turnover tape recordings that incriminate him in the end that we're putting into an ongoing criminal investigation\nOr it is true he's also said that it's one of if he cited it in a list of one of the great cases showing the independence of the judiciary but he also said things that may be set has said maybe it was wrongly decided\nThat we really don't know where he is on that what we do know is that he's a very very strong advocate of executive power\nIn a wide array of areas and even proposed at one point that Congress should pass a law that would exempt that President from criminal investigation or civil suits while he's president\nNo on this question he only has one vote obviously but I Do think you'll probably get a lot of respect for this he spent a lot of time and the executive branch you spend it in the White House and he was part of the Ken Starr investigation and so his view of how disruptive this can be to the presidency to have you know criminal proceedings in Grand juries like may get a lot of attention from the other justices\nWhere is Kevin are going to fit a on the court in terms of the other conservatives you already have Justice Alito Justice Thomas now justice Gorsuch pretty reliable conservatives in ... as he become the swing vote on the court\nOn Robert in it in a technical sense there probably are some cases like the case involving Obamacare and we she cast the deciding vote but mostly\nObama and the other conservatives and in the court or at least pretty much in lock step on the outcome I mean he dissented in gay marriage he dissented in gerrymandering he just sent it in a whole bunch of other you know a whole bunch of other cases it's\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October fifteenth MLA Dutch Denver ... to\nSome extent or another there's nobody like that in the center of the court now there are four\nPretty liberal justices I Would call them to most liberals they would seem to be moderate liberals but they are on the liberal side and then five quite hardcore\nConservatives with chief justice Roberts I think really worried about the court institutionally not going too far too fast but\nUh that's probably what's holding him back I think\nYeah and I think that that ... that phrase too fast is probably where it's going to be you're going to see the chiefs influenced the most not that he's going to switch sides but he's going to turn it into a liberal all of a sudden\nBut rather that he is going to want to keep the pay slow so that the court isn't being seen as extremely aggressive and partisan particularly over the course of the next eight twelve months or so\nOr he may not want to see cases overturned rat quite rapidly but he wouldn't mind seeing the law of all in a conservative\n[noise]\nThis is a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy hops in the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court comes on the year anniversary of the me too movement it also comes a month before the midterm elections which would determine whether Democrats or Republicans\nControl the house and the Senate and how much President Trump will be able to get done for the remainder of his presidency\nNPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell start with you what does this mean for the key right\nTrump will be able to get done for the remainder of his presidency NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell start with you what does this mean for the key races coming up\nWhile the one thing that we are going to be watching very closely is what it means for Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota who voted no\nUh she was under a lot of pressure to support Kavanaugh because she is running for reelection in a state that President Trump won within very significant margin in twenty sixteen\nPolls have shown her slipping recently but she put out a statement saying that she was making her decision based both on the fact that she thought that his performance at that hearing was partisan\nAnd because she worried about the message that would send to women and young girls about the treatment of the way that we're in an America treat the accusations of sexual assault\nShe is in a precarious situation here running against a very conservative House Republican who has strong name id in that state and she as far as I can understand it from talking to people that know her well made that decision here but that got decision may be a really\nBig you know may take a hit for her in the polls other person I'm watching as Joe mansion in West Virginia who is the only Democrat who voted yes\nVery much or invasion was this or that people do indoors and very much and we have something as we have to deal with this firm\nAnd he said that he had it looking out for what's right for West Virginia again a state that President Trump won fairly significantly in twenty sixteen\nDominican much in our NPR lead politics editor is this going to impact the races of people who don't have to vote on this I'm thinking of people like Beto O'Rourke a who's running in Texas against Ted Cruz\nWell he's got his own an uphill battle and uh that's the fact that a Texas is Texas [laughter] that's a different situation but I think tells his right to zero in on some of these red state Republican a red state Democrats who are running in places\nThat President Trump won you know Texas is among those kinds of places but first and foremost you got to look\nA like a tells you mentioned that Heidi Heitkamp you know someone like John ... says easy no he's seen in Montana in Montana seems finding his race but Joe Donnelly who I\nReally wonder if he would have rather\nKind of said nothing or before saying no immediately after uh that Thursday hearing uh I don't think Democrats quite realized how this was going to fire up Republican white men in particular this\nUh you know our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll really showed a big shift among Republicans and it was driven by by men within the Republican Party or who shifted very quickly\nAnd you know you have something like eighty percent of the Republican Party right now saying that the elections are a very important and that significant because that's basically a tie statistical tie with Democrats\nAnd Democrats had a ... point advantage on that over the summer now does that remain this high or does that recede given the fact that Kavanaugh looks like he will be confirmed and the fact is Democrats democratic women democratic men they\nHave been fired up the entire time and are expected to stay at that level\nOkay well let's listen we've been talking to a a couple of strategists on each side here this is John braved under Republican strategist and here's what he thinks that this means\nWhat we found that in the last week is there certainly seems that some Republicans come out I'm probably had is that particularly moderate Republicans are not huge fans of this president he makes up for that oftentimes by getting conservative Democrats\nBut at least for a lot of the surveys I've seen in the last week a lot of them the number one that the Democrats overplay their hand that it wasn't even that they didn't believe professor Ford\nThey just were unhappy with a lot of the tactics that they saw the Democrats taking and felt that uh they were they were just merely playing politics\nAnd I'm so it was interesting too it's so it's a lot of the Republican Party a bit and um but\nI think the question now is can they keep that sort of small momentum going all the way until election day\nOkay so that's a Republican strategist this is democratic strategist Anna Greenberg\nI think it's very helpful for Democrats I think it's going to galvanize women who are already feeling aggrieved\nBut I also think that way Trump doubled down and attacked Dr Ford rallies and I think Kevin not really I just think all hands are fairly leaving for him in the end um galvanized Democrats even more\nTells me I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today are talking with protesters outside the Supreme Court and outside the capital and some of them said to me\nI think he's going to be confirmed but that's just going to make me more excited to go out and vote for Democrats this November ... what do you think when you hear those two strategist who who is going to be more energized well\nI think that Dominican as of right yeah it's really hard to get people Democrats more energized than they already are\nI Do think that there is a question that has been raised not just by Democrats but by some Republicans about how much this support for the precedent that we're seeing right now it's conditional on this issue we seen that happen over and over and over again where a Republican voters in Republican elected officials will join Trump side\nWhen he's doing something that they like and then quickly abandoned him when he does things like handle rally at the end says things that are politically incorrect or offensive\nAnd that's been the story of the relationship between traditional Republicans and this president since he was elected and in fact in ... he became the nominee so I it will be interesting challenge to see if that changes in the situation as well\nYou know what do you think I Want to\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nFor Republican enthusiasm and it will recede at least partially because probably because some of the wives of these guys will tie them up and not let them go out and south [laughter]\nMinute ago so the thing is when you're talking to Jon Benet bender who's a Republican and Anna Greenberg who's a democratic pollster both very good at what they do they're both looking at how this plays with their bases and like I was saying both bases are fired up over this right\nThe real issue I think for what's going to determine this election\nIs how those swing voters those middle of the road suburban women or do you know go out and vote in this election do they go out and vote in some of these kind of moderate to right leaning districts in these house districts now look remember Democrats need twenty three seats Internet twenty three seats\nTo take back the house I think that what we've seen over the past week or two\nWith how the Senate numbers have moved there is a very real possibility\nThat Democrats wind up losing out in the Senate where they lose a couple of seats and wind up taking back the house that's a very real possibility has been a real possibility from the beginning and it's starting to look more like the most likely scenario because\nThe ... the Republican leaning a in suburban women have really moved very sharply and been sharply opposed\nTo President Trump a all alone and there was a huge list of\nA potential targets in those are in the ... suburban district\nAnd the numbers in the Senate let's read reprise those or reprint is that um there are\nA twenty six to ... twenty six Democrats up\nFor democratic Democrat and only nine and then only nine Republican seats and and and that ten of those are in overwhelmingly resonates so out of the Democratic seats of the seats the Democrats have to hold onto our and overwhelmingly red states\nIt's a it's gotta be Quantico huge uphill climb\nWell it's worse than that it's actually the worst landscape ever for a Senate map that any party has ever faced since the direct election of senators\nI guess Lindsey Graham would say it's it's hell and beyond health [laughter] so so for Democrats um we're in the midst of course of the me too movement and even during this entire nomination process for Brett Kavanaugh\nTo executives at CBS News became the latest men to be ousted it because of allegations of of a sexual misconduct let's say\nPresident Trump has been accused himself Brett Kavanaugh as we know has been accused they it it appears both have ... so far survived those allegations while so many other uh\nHave fallen Kelsey a one in three women\nHave been victims themselves of sexual assault one in six men I think as they watched everything that went on how does that play I mean they they have personal experience with the kinds of things that Christine Blasey Ford were was talking about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "06"}
