it just released its entire season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that just season a rough it let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it [laughter] getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a light on actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I'd have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got much bigger laugh when I was expected him from the crowd of people\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press tour about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner gr I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a show a little bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the\nAh tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um and it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius\nWho you know touches a show in terms of them to go in at all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um it's a very collaborative process and we have people\nMaking a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room the cash springs\nBetter every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had also the ah directors brings so much to the episodes of the story about animators the editors um it it it really\nIt takes a village um so it's odd that yes I'm doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who represents that as our TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slap stick the ponds and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes for\nHim it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um\nYou know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and those guys are talking octopus or [laughter] you know we're we're exploring ... trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals [laughter] um so [laughter] this\nIs quite serious about the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is retelling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of the animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adults as Beau jak or\nWho to whom do you think you owe your origins in television who do you see is your phone [laughter]\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah where do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nAnd it's not I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them to shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ...\nWell I I think you know obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson um\nBut also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist outside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to say when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first it's going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening it's going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the\nUm and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak Amy today are credible artist Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and and then a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm\nSee them as one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nI thought he was cast her whale\nAs a newscaster well uh we we had in the script you um you know a a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda la montage and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role [laughter]\nReally I recall that means like yeah it sounds like fun um and he's fantastic you bring it back season after season and you know what am I a first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some whale noises\nAnd you know this is Keith Olbermann who I was a very serious man are goofing around going\nYou know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think [laughter] well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is in the show now disease and that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we can is Alison or in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast or we'd been working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be a lead on our show any more um and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more\nAh as I was looking around at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our castles whites and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this was an unintentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the patron or freedom theater at the gym and death dot com oh\nYou know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices are trying to have more people of color on the show when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles\nAnd I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently is casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said in these other interviews um I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness\nHas prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it's not like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it\nThen you know maybe this won't become an issue or this won't become the thing that I ended up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there was also talking ... you know anti ... and and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how was an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nI I think there are differences and I'm more interested in exploring them now and I feel like\nMeans you're sharing with him [noise] well I'll Try calling back with anything that comes along super thank you ... joining friday afternoon

NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest in welcome to one a\nAh thanks for having me Joshua insects whereas it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer and major writing and moved to New York in a you know my brother is working at CERN it a lot of time as a receptionist\nAnd they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and uh uh I got the job and I do know I did it just get my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make somebody connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept on doing the cue cards and I got really good at doing ... very quickly\nAnd uh you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I'm On my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one especially on Saturday Night live\nThe live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera a and helping reactors and helping the guest stars or through the shows him through this hard show that that you know they ... a lot of them have never done lived before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and ah you know I rose up pretty quickly and the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live um\nThe Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway that shoots\nAnd then we do to show any show that comes in that town that he's ... guards you know work on that as well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of work the first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yeah we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen a role written in all\nCaps yes correct It's you know it's it's a it is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about\nThe spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences it's not something like I Can't just bring somebody else history and say OK started doing the guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train that for like two or three weeks I'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn um\nTwo or three weeks of training\nYeah it is 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just send them she's been okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during residence where how to end the card of courage to stand on a period or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next time just so many different roles where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight\nLike near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses will your glasses on the show where you are contacts or you know we're either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so you want your glasses so you can see fine I Want to have to if you didn't wear glasses and you want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you could see but that would also make less words in the card\nAnd it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I wouldn't recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we were we were to have her son's Robert practiced with you if you've never read cue cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because it'll it'll look like you're reading the cue cards how do you mean it looked as regularly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing\n... the live stream by essay Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October nine through November fourth that the ... or freedom theater ... death dot com\nBandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later the audience would be like oh he's we obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we won't be depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nSo your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction to the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live\nThat's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cars and I work with the director of the stage managers well all kinds of concern I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously haven't filled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsal is on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day\nAnd then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it'll change from surfing the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely written from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process we print but that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it do being the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the\nFriday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have to find job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actors having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you a lawyer you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working\nFor ... there's a little bit of both um mostly um people are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do at great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced and the people that want they than in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but\nYeah you sit those long days or friday but that leaves the Saturday wherever they then they come out from behind the scenes and there are staying with me 'cause I Can't I Can't hold for sketches at one time you know for a sense of cars at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it\nHow close up to Showtime safe for
