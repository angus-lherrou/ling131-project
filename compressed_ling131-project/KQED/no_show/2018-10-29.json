of of\nSocio economic or any kind or or geographic here you're at\nAnd I think that's one of the things that that is really interesting for me about that that\nIs that it's it is a it's incorrect to call it a pastiche I mean it's I really felt that I heard heard a broad spectrum of what was going on in San Francisco it wasn't people weren't talked to to make an argument people were spoken to to give us an lighten it\nAbout who they were what they were the venture capitalists business important is the cafeteria work and you know and it's like all these people and this has to settle down into a working society and right now it's not working\nAt the the goal of a book like this Studs Terkel and some real master of or us we work like this\nIs what would you do is you the reader now is spoken to directly by each person my voice is out of the questions were out of it it's it's sort of a first person story or a monologue delivered directly to the reader\nAnd its apps and all the indicators of a photograph or I'm an image or a video that comes with other documentary work I used to do this is everybody's words on a page everybody's equal to one another everybody's approximately the same length\nIn the book summer live longer and shorter of course but but none are are trying to be less whole\nUm and so a friend of mine actually somebody in the book who uh rented recently\nUm who ... read their park for for the first time and and also read the entire book came back and said carry it feels like a party um of everybody in San Francisco I didn't know\nAnd it was so glad to meet you know I find that people in the book are able to get to a place of real philosophical and poetic reflection\nWhere sometimes I'm just knocked over pie but um after\nA couple of hours of sitting with somebody in their living room and talking to them where they arrive at a their perspective of this region and and all of its with for the most part a fair amount of good humor empathy towards one another um and reflection I'm about their own situation and what they can do better\nA tale for everyone up but right now they're trying to work it out here you know I don't carry such a pleasure I have to come back here again my pleasure more thank you for having me\nLike yesterday is Carrie McClellan his book is silicon city San Francisco in a long shadow of the valley it's published by W W

...\nCancer I asked Dr Brian Schwartz the chief medical officer of our kill to remind us what its ... syndrome\n... syndrome is one of the family of syndromes of what we call over gross diseases and unfortunately what this is for these people is little ... cells that in while the the embryo is developing pick up a specific mutation\nAs the person grows those little ... to sell stuff to grow in an uncontrolled matter so what ... syndrome ends up being is areas in the body normally the skin muscle fat bone or the brain that grows uncontrolled\nSo as you saw in the movie some of these patients will have one very long all one big mess on one side of the body or on the digits or on their feet so it's it's a very sporadic and it it\nOn their feet so it's it's a very sporadic and and the ... in different areas and the difficulty with this disease is almost every body is different because the area where you have the cells are different in most patients\nThe disease itself normally when kids all\nYoung sail boat normal an as they grow so these areas with these cells start growing uncontrollably so they end up with these big of a gross unfortunately there's no treatment until they discovered\nAnd what we try and is the first as a medical intervention with the drug for this disease\nThey only way they could treat this disease was through surgery to remove these big gross or to Chuck ... pieces of bone that had grown uncontrollably or to stop the growth of bone so there's no real treatment for these very very unfortunate people\nSaid they were just figure it and then they were for further to take it trying to remove them from the body\nHundred percent correct you know meeting some of these patients it's it's been an amazing\nExperience for me you know someone living with the stop the disease once it gets diagnosed they never know how big or how false or how quick these areas are going to grow\nIt is also life threatening so about twenty five percent of patients with this disease unfortunately will pass away before they get to the end of adulthood and the disease grows most rapidly while they're young and slows down and around Eighteen [noise]\nThe other part about the disease which has been a really interesting experience for me has been out interactions with the ... age group [noise]\nProfessor ... at the end I H is the person who discovered that this disease is caused by a specific mutation cold the mutation of eight Katie and using it even has a specific just one base pay a change\nOne little one ... billion pairs one\nIt'll change and unfortunately that's what causes the disease [noise]\nIt's very re fortunately for the ... but unfortunately for the people that are afflicted we know of about sixty people in the U.S that go to the ... and we estimate there's a couple hundred in the world\nThat's the extent of this disease so\nVery re the story from all kill side is as soon as the ... to ... discovered that it's an A. K. C. mutation we had been developing an A. K. C. inhibitor which would potentially stopped the signaling of the cells\nFor cancer because that same gene has been found to be an uncle gene in certain cancers\nNow what I said cells keep growing it's called\nA tumor ... theory and also what's interesting is a reasonably large proportion of these protests cancer patients also ... a developed cancers at a young age [noise]", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29"}
