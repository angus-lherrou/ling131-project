Cape Cod Hi Josh and Shane Harris covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post to have you back saying Hi from afar Joshua\nLet's begin with the weather which made big news this week you know it's been more than fifty years since the United states had a storm like hurricane Michael\nFlorida's panhandle bore the brunt of the damage that's where it made landfall many beachfront homes are in pieces some of them in splinters at best\nAnd the number of water rescues are under way more than a million power customers in Florida Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia art disconnected and the death toll has risen to at least Thirteen people\nThe administrator of FEMA Brock Long spoke to CNN's John Berman on new day what's the biggest challenge you and your teams are facing this morning for\nAccess you know access all the areas is one thing a search and rescue is where we are hyper focus this morning [noise] uh but as that uh you know simultaneously what we're trying to do is assessed roadways and bridges to make sure that we can get you know teams commodities and equipment and to the areas that were hardest hit\nA hospital system not near Panama City in and around Panama City took a hit too so we we have to stabilize the Cape and health and medical capabilities that are there\nAre over thirty thousand workers from around the United states that have been pre stage to try to work as quickly as possible to get the power back on but here again it's all about access we gotta get make sure that it's safe to travel down roadway quarters and get in there to uh start rebuilding the power grid which could take a a very long time at this point\nIt's FEMA administrator Brock Long speaking on CNN he also expressed some frustration with Floridians who did not mind the updates to the building codes which were updated in two thousand one pretty clear to see which homes were up to code and which were not you can tell which homes were up to code because they were still

Washington Post and lose your Molly of kick your Wheaties California report before we move on from the weather and climate really there was one more thing you want to\nYeah I just wanted to I can mention you know ... the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week at talking about carbon taxes being the solution to this crisis at least in part\nAnd and you know I think it's important to recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you connect to tax uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue had on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people can make money investors take to make money off of it because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAnd an economic argument it's often on carbon tax at that it's bad for business California is the second largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown deciding executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality\nBy twenty forty five ... sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to wonder if that policy prescriptions the I the ...\nActually very close to that policy prescriptions the I the ... the set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really and California is very serious about doing it\nAt the very serious about doing it at you know Paul Romer tax it out\nThey probably think it'd be solved and tell you build consensus on and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada that same thing there yeah prime minister Justin Trudeau train at ... at\nAnd posted a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not my ... tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change a good point not my economy I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not questioning the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLarry tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida that is the base will risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there\nYou just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the talented and incorporate it it's it's a tough one\nNobody's really tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are tied and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em their existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastal into when we're talking about today but large cities you know like Miami in Florida and other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change is a real honest discussion about long term risk\nAnd what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just to and if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the

Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nGo it seems to have had opposite effect so at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put to provide so around what I'm about to say\nUh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming mid terms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state actually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat\nTo now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it's had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nOr you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may\nIf the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like a shame said before\nThey will become the peanut factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background\nCheck that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee around here the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to take up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary ... she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the cancer can grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face on how much intervention did the White House do an essay supplemental background check will click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up there she's up for reelection\nYou think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily young who wants to know why she sat on that letter friends Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd my thing I'll say it she just last night on with trying to take the fight from you know on this thing too\nThat the way that companies trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court hearing California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store in ... side the White House just put forth it's three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on that and she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt ... really breaking friend tradition by not getting the home state senators any say in these pets\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics before the roundup is up but a few more things to DC we wanted to discuss

bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching his head about what does he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment and I know for for for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest of moving past as quickly as we could still do that too but I should note that ... old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British and has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram
