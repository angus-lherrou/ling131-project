Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire we'd love to hear from you to share what you know about finding a job in today's economy comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video stream courtesy of New Hampshire public radio\nTweet us at one a or email one at a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any men to what the deal you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree not and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of these skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute for workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you and he put a question to answer on our website about\nJob you and he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find what you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree\nOn line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or does it manifest in other ways in that well\nI think the main thing that is that when she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state that has this kind of a deterrent to\nBring more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year it's sort of lagging there's prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs Joe yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies the crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted that gives billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what shook my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome\nThank you\nRyan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure why I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands wage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation and wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places at the health of project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years\nGeographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one eight tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at aged Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now as being in a a labor shortage capital L capital asked labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity international data that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we're just having observed that overall ... after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins I for example of wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England and the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this it's a broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nMichelle emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised fares we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you were dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\n[noise] well I don't know why\nSponsorship of the cake

construction\nManufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in India factoring or in high tech\nLet's get through a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester we've been out of work for at least six months I overheard conversations in my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\n... how do you see this did the impact of of older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley\nIt's becoming worrisome at this point where if you're old we've just decided we don't want you\nYou went from being just one of the most sort of white film extraordinary people buy new and he became this

W T grant foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation was ... and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both mental and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want to experience people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and we're out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we were really struggling with two items one is employed turned over where there are chasing higher wages and new facilities are new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story when there's\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to them their brain drain some cities and counties in states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers\nTo the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAn accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to want to say\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nYet to come home award program that we lost in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship and smiles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarship to talk about doing that but\nAt its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work\nAs really at home all reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair county to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we allow people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that they have some family connection here there's probably a better that they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county paint me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron on the St Clair river\nUm our largest town of course here as a population of about thirty thousand people we did not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities a small town America\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit\nUm but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged on the economic health of regions like pork here at our Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it\nSponsorship of the cake you mean the live stream by super micro Silicon Valley based
