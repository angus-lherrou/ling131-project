deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generate\nWell billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it but directly to the universities and to the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites and all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does money go\nThe money largely goes to be adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out searching scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches make as much as a half million dollars a year\nAll throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and

that pro franchises are are making or generating the differences that they're actually paying the players\nAnd the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploited they are dealers in human athletic flesh\nAnd they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's

the background\nOr their kids to when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as out of business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because

country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere but the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids\nThe thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach you say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bringing them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get there\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network in the street runners sort of pre agents to build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\n[noise] but then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this\nSo in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners go between\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bride is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send him to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap [noise]\nAll right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of the ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a walk if you have five or can over those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting water money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars\nIf I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player I don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded their specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your trial should go to they will find you designer for your new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and\nA lot of the players wants to deal with known quantities and part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up with a with players\nMichael ... new book is

school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nPitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees are sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Pitino has a pending

Michael ... whose new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news where people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked what the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time\nWas a shock ...\nAnd has had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case set it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's\nReally at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nWhat kind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe one of the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their teen first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you were you were having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the midst of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nThem to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations is a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nDo think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nJust in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of\nOut you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful sunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grassroots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that oh this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects she would apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in\nThese charges the apparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a good deed is executive who is one of the ... current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and certainly James ghetto who ... executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball insider almost all of these defendants\nAre well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family\nWere part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they are planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the
