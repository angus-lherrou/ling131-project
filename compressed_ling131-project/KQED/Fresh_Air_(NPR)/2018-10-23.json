is known for her comic roles and movies like bridesmaids and the heat and for her impersonation of President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by the Israel\nIsrael who died in twenty fourteen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to the bank cat and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flop she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cats that bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by the ... very luminaries like Dorothy Parker ed ... rubber no coward and the actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors\nReviewing the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote Lee Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year\nLet's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confide your secret to jak hop a fellow alcoholic who scrape spy on charm wet and numerous scams and hustles jak is played by Richard II grant each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor [noise]\nThat wants to hold my friends with the

of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and told the wrong because I get a better response because if you told [noise]\nThe only one with her [laughter] you\nKnow this McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic bitter way\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starring in a new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess as Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you've very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say\nInfamous scene [laughter] blend dividing the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dresses yet and\nYou know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay\n... none of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for like a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause this weird things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like ... look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] within it'd be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes so your mind is really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but\nIt wasn't intended it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible in wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMost McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise]\nIs um insults [laughter]\nInsulting oh no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd that that the other couple the Leslie manpower ... Koppel have threatened you so you're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my husband's an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous\nWho talks like that you do hear him say All right you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly no no when he when he said to me was he called me a what language Catherine\nLanguage for me to relate what they do not both said to me unless I say it\nCan you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her saying next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was that there are bank commercial that's what you look like\nYour bank commercial capital none of this talk is productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in a jar with my foot down here it's just really scaring me this is what happens when you cornered rat you corner me I Will shoot drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him improving insults in that scene in it and just got back on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever um I don't know if it's like a thirty ... part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched\nThat back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] and never say that\nAnd the first time a sitting with was to sit for watching you say it he said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up to the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nHow'd you improv insults before\n[noise] yes I've had a\nCrew internally I have played a lot of kind of very\nAssertive um characters that you know I think in the heat especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just that you literally say anything she just to kind of ... ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authorities so it was a big part of that character you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and are there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on Netflix Wednesday\n\nOn ... and\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring where employers can post jobs and do your screener questions\nTo build their short list of preferred candidates learn more and indeed dot com slash higher\nAnd from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company\nFamily owned operated and argued over since Nineteen eighty proud supporter of independence\nThought whether that's on line over the air or in a bottle more it Sierra Nevada dot com\n[noise] support for ...

[noise]\nLearn more AT T I Am a\nDot org [noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nIt when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nTo one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your\nTop off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does\nIt ever worked for you is any woman ever been like\nOh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shut them now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler\nGod I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road it's like it's so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching sang times oh my God so I Know there's the light oh the ever present\nUh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white man\nI Would have flash in like ...\nYes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the feeling other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like\nI thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing an and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get\nGood roles [noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read your kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like what it who who cares there's nothing to sink your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really bland and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all\n[laughter] I say I'm Still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun\n[laughter] why she always a bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yeah try to women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a\nProducer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now\nEvery little inch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think it's so important for me to its its branching out to every one it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you

is fresh air I'm Terry Gross we're about to have perhaps the most important midterm election of our time the outcome will determine who controls the house and the Senate in this very divisive era as well as you governs key battleground states the results could be determined by who has the right to vote\nSince the ... election over twenty states have adopted new restrictions on voting such a strict voter ID laws cutbacks to early voting and aggressive purging voters\nSince twenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called use it or lose it policy which English people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough\nIn Georgia alone that policy purged in estimated a hundred seven thousand voters according to a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nIn twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nThe current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering and I guess Ari Berman has been covering developments in voting rights and voting restrictions he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's a senior writer for Mother Jones are reporting fellow at the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talk state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now\nSo since the twenty ten election\nTwenty four states have implemented a new restrictions on voting so nearly half the states in the country have tightened their voting laws\nTo do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast a ballot or make it more difficult to register to vote or to cut back\nOn early voting periods or to close polling places or to purge the voter rolls and many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now in the ... elections in critical states like Georgia North Dakota Kansas et cetera where there are very close election\nSo is it a coincidence that all of this is happening [noise]\nIt's not a coincidence this has really been a major strategy within the Republican Party\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book you must have ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been a leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the west Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done\nIn Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act that did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state the federal court actually struck that law down\nEarlier this year and said that there was almost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voter so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the loss of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote\nThat part of the law remains in effect and I looked at the numbers in Kansas and over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed in Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes\nAnd now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in Kobach favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turnout by two percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the truth\nPeople that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted in legally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what kind of combat due to prove that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically ... was a ... for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd Kobach had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally\nIn the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach Trump tweeted\nThat millions of people voted legally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim\nAnd showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nKoh Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nChris called back has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is a voting issue called back advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures it's used to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine how many electoral votes each state has so the centrist is instrumental when it comes to voting\nAnd what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time of the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says\nI Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the senses and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words the illegals or being counted when it comes to representation I I don't want to get to technical here cherry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted\nWhen it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation an area should have\nWhat Kobach wants to do is restrict those\nDistricts to only counting people who are citizens if you did that areas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California\nWould have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way districts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift\nTo Republicans because generally speaking air is lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the census the areas where these people live\nWill get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and after it senses so where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York and sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if a centrist is unfair assessment is inaccurate and so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guest is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones\nAfter a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and how it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression in voting rights\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise]\nThen you know our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and it's a commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support\nFor NPR comes from this station and from ... committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise location [noise]\nMatinees EM dot com slash NPR [noise]\nAnd from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be opened from anywhere\nCapital one what's in your wallet capital one an a\n\nA\n[noise]\nA marker woman a refugee from Syria wanted to finish high school in the U.S she learned English excelled as a student and then she aged out before she can graduate how age will push immigrant students out of school it's on the world\nEasier to register to vote in crucial swing states like Michigan Nevada through things like automatic and election day registration there are initiatives in four states to make it harder to gerrymander by doing things like citizen ladder non partisan redistricting\nIn places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ballot initiative to one that could affect the most people is in Florida where they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored it by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million\nEx felons can felt that the staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony conviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential election aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative\nWould restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restore voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he is emitted as felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised African Americans\nAren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo in the past have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as the Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court now has added Kevin not to the bench which has been mission on voting rights\nHe has from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights he upheld a voter id law from South Carolina and twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state\nBut cabin I wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud\nThat states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota light Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence\nOf the kind of fraud that they are reporting to crack down on\nThey can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words of promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember in ... Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights\n[noise] it's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered a swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored of the twenty Thirteen decision that got to the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread or pervasive and his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act to places like Texas and Georgia orange taste that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act in tap\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fry how pervasive haven't then\nStudy shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent but incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York and the state with out of voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their address as I Would\nHave to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already and\nI Would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine and I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that\nSo it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number of votes one vote usually most and so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting\nAnd I would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine\nAnd I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that so it doesn't mean that voter fraud never cursed but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting\nA very small number of votes one vote usually most and so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevent it from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud were saying\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is journalist Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the ballot for modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's also a senior reporter for Mother Jones who's been reporting extensively on the latest developments in voting ... we'll
