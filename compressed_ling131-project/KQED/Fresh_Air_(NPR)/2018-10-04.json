I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well in your movie was that your experience\n[noise] I actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hare who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there is a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things like her\nBut it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine ... character is a writer and she has a new\nBook that's about to be published and novel that's called women's studies and her\nAge and cause her and said have you seen the cover and Catherine has has no no no and so she runs through her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looked at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Catherine has a feminist and the character and\nAnd in the novel or on the cover there's a woman and there's like white flowing dress in the field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul

seen from my guess Temer Jenkins new movie which is called private life so did\nYou have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah you mean blaming myself yeah eating we utilize all righty\nAnd Catherine my and Kevin hon in your head having that argument with yourself\nYeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um you know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some\nNotion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori time ever said that exactly you know she's really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly she feels like the rug it's been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available\nTo her I think for a lot of women when you're trying\nTo reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of\nBecoming I mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking back plunging what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career in being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very consuming and not\nConducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but [noise] and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know it it was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seem like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his suit and and had a compulsive gambler like he was really like a character\nSo you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and no one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing\nUm in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type [noise] I'm right and there isn't a strange men\nNeed between you between the character and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parenting during that time has made you so focused on the idea of family [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean I [noise] I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured\nAnd there were multiple said you know there's actually four children and um we you know didn't live with their mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot\n[laughter] what what is your mother arrangements um when I was a teenager or at that point I had I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ...\nWe moved away from living on my dad's plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother just ten years older than me\nHad been a living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and I was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um she was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school\nAnd did I Want to move with him\nSort of save my life how did he say I didn't because I he paid attention well than I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of began became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents and we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother [laughter]\nYou know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and do we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and [noise] um\n... you know we our lives improved and we became much better students\n[laughter] school which was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were ...\nNot to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity what's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood [noise]\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent\nAnd having hostile relationships with our landlords because my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um um and then when we lived with my mother or she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and\nThere was never food in the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail through like olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples so when you were living with\nYour brother was it when at Harvard and on the ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off mass of [noise] so how was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot\nOf college students [noise] yeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at those you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm not that that that

visited Mark Zuckerberg at his home ... at his office had numerous meetings a lot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists getting connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with him\n[noise] well he did it I should say reluctantly um you know this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this for a big powerful company um\nAnd who I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president\nAnd ah as that accumulated I continue to say look this fundamentally should be about how Mark Zuckerberg sees the world and over time they came to I think sort of grudgingly and I but I'm I'm grateful for it\nExcept the idea that\n[noise]

our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call external and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decrease sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they are trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is Annette ... and the company has been done to acknowledge it you heard for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively\nIf you're just sitting there scrolling would glazed dies hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you and so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively communicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key\nDifference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental promise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that\nYou talked to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow how does he regards this kind of experimentation\nHe absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he has an and some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a uh to to get out into the world I'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would ...\nAt the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing and that idea about criticism I'm really hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond his comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had\nA civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary member of the public complaining about Facebook but that was simply a sign that they were being bold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm\nHe did and it caused a big uproar at the time he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel\nThe same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nA and people ... that's ... that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states it's it's really embedded in the bill of rights and um his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people further\nThere was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be\nAggressively transparent in order 'em to be modern this the sense was as one person to put it um [noise] you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like it that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private solves in our public solves but that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed\nThat being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and their their ... their model of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world\nNow almost like redefining what it is to be him on [noise] yeah\nThey believed that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you have this almost messianic\nSense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building computer applications you were actually building tools that were fundamentally reshaping society and they embrace that wholeheartedly\n[noise] there was a recent data breach at Facebook where\nFifty million users information was taken by somebody how how serious a problem as this\nThis is a serious one this is the largest security breach in Facebook's history and what was unusual about this and what sets it apart from other cases like Cambridge Analytica was that this was outright fast this was a case of hackers or hacker we still don't know who it was I'm\nFinding essentially an an under protected door and walking through it and taking control of\nAt least fifty million Facebook user accounts Facebook also\nI'm to be safe or took another forty million users and kick them off the force them to log back in so it may be as many as Ninety million or more that were affected by this and and in this case the hackers were able to get total control\nOf the accounts so ah there they were able to get control of your privacy settings that could go into your messages they could postings on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers\nDoing that so that only heightens the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who studied history ... what is it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they would have they would have\nProbably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they had to talk about this breach or really before they know very much about it so it's it's raises many questions as if the answer to this point\nWe're listening to the interview ... recorded with Evan Austin is a staff writer for the New Yorker\nI've noticed this article about Facebook is titled goes from a machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy we're hearing more of the interview after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nThe nouveau our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes

and Maria monetti shrimp founders of the ... museum of art at UC Davis [noise]\nWho believe that all people deserve access to education and culture to enrich a lifetime of exploration and learning\nSo when we're beginning to emerge about the spread of a false information on Facebook or some of it by her by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency in Russia um how did soccer bird respond to this [noise]\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might have affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were in [noise]\nSince then [noise] um [noise]\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here I'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case state initially they ...\nI'm they have come to understand that that simply not the case they initially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation and and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation and what's remarkable about that is is how\nEfficient it was actually as a as a conduit for disinformation because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin had fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project\nAnd yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had this dispositive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged that affirmed working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's why I'm so companies in big trouble ...\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how did he do\nWell there is a lot riding on that appearance or you know in many ways a kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and there was growing calls for regulation and\nHe\nIn some ways is vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point Orrin Hatch senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\nSecretary kind of 'em gave a little smile and said senator we run ads it was such an obvious fact anybody use paid attention to technology that it really I think under scored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies\nAnd Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the post that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm [noise] they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same as everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known\nA adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of business success they they just stumbled on something that was\nI'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back over and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the the content I'm that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approached the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye career you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company I'm doing this\nIt's become this consuming effort or you know Facebook over the last year as a as a controversy has grown they undertaken one initiative after another so when it comes to political election\nUh advertising for instance what they said was okay even though for years we argued\nThat we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ad now we are going to not only do that but we are going to go farther than TV does we're going to let users be able to click on an ad and then no not only who paid for it but what other ads to those people pay for an end who were they targeting\nUm they're also saying we're going to\nDo more to defend against the kind of disinformation campaigns what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior essentially um misinformation it's distributed to try to shape elections not only the United states but in other countries and they've had to in in in many ways David almost like they've put a gun to take on some of the qualities of a government you know they've had to hire\nPeople who actually worked in the U.S government on things like misinformation\nUm in order to try to ferret out efforts by Russian officials who are are in one case there was an Iranian campaign to try to spread misinformation but what we don't know and really won't know until after\nThe midterm elections in the U.S and and the elections that come to follow our whether or not that's that's working um and I think what's interesting is so Facebook on has become much more public these days in terms of talking about when it finds examples of disinformation it'll announced it will say we took down a group of\nRussian I'm In pastors who were seeking to affect American voting behavior for instance um\nBut that's either a sign that they're winning the\n\n\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with Evan Austin's he's a staff writer for the New Yorker his story ghost in the machine about Martin Zucker burg and Facebook appears in a recent issue of the magazine they recently took down um posts from Alex Jones of infowars you want to tell us that ...\nYeah this was a a really an important case study in how Facebook skin to deal with its most complicated problem in some sense which is content what are you simply do with the fact that people are posting a billion items of content to Facebook every day that's the actual number and\nWhat they've tried to do is to say okay we're we're going to punish hate speech we're going to prevent hate speech from being on here um but for things that are less than hate speech if it's just misinformation or things that appear to be wrong by accent well then we're not going to ban that person from Facebook we're going to try to use other tools we may\nMake their posts less visible we might share the last\n... but the case of infowars which as we all know is a a conspiracy website led by Alex Jones and [noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "04"}
