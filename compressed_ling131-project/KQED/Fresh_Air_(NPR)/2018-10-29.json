writing things down or drawing pictures or or did you just kinda mulling over for ... for a while\nSo I ran them and now I got a new book and I started writing down ideas and then when we got back to Denver I\nThought how can I take for nothing spices and ... and turn them into something really exciting and I we'd get ideas from highs and cookies and cakes and I think okay\nHow do I take cherry pie and make it just in my quizzing are basically a raw raw and processed food and make it\nTaste like cherry higher apple pie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining it's going to do a lot of cooking and you're in your kitchen we could create an art I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and you're going to get the ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like getting to be like the the ball of a match\nAnd then you would like to get out with your hands and like\nI roll it out with a rolling ten and then um I got to cut her and I would like to

tree of life in a God in Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how ... views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement pose is my guest ... is a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nIt focuses on the story of Derek Black\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nIn a few minutes we'll hear an accepted the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\nSasha welcome back to a fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the center God I thought about your book\n... black as we knows his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that\nBut do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert dollars\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the view expressed by the shooter and you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body he had a tattoo fourteen eighty eight to white national slogans fourteen or first throughout a fourteen word sort of\nStatement a purpose that is central to what starting frog does about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children and\nSaying things like I'm here because of the white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get get murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language in the motivation that exist on store front and that's the way that they speak\nAbout this quote unquote race for that they believe is under way\nYeah it was a I'm a ... I had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek worst central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about uh you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people that you know it's it's\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's in reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue I'm In ... is the site that we'll be talking\nAbout in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from a sound your son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero am a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm front um is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many have\nYou know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that well this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too\nFar and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our\nGlobal with and that choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or guarantee black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and you know and I think that he's heartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for\nHim because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways the Gulf War and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this\nI'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular icing on the movement said to then have somebody\nGo into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio and for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked ... is the author of the book rising Adam he treated about Darren lack a former white nationalist

winning Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha slow who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included sense now the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to you it's like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race is like\nYeah my dad and popularized the term white nationalism in into that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front call that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that you didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism what did they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nEssentially everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the way their clients to word um\nRacial less racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think the the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies movement of people who are actively pursuing in and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to

immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote cure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the ... the ideology is built on a fallacy an and for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean that you want to separate people have different races and different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nWas a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never republic uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators

Western Europe in uh south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that\nSo the conclusion and the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white was that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recruited

interview I recorded in September with Jared black a former white nationalist leader who announced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred so they're one of the things you did you have been home schooled\nSo you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way you described it in the book was a pretty liberal college in Florida they were Jewish people they're usually try to hide your identity and then you could you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you in a gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's their black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who were you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found that he really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who had ... we didn't initially no was Jewish um\nWhat what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you that made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew Shabaab dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every other thing that we were possibly interested in did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about what we're thinking about Jewish people\n[laughter] that affected have like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups there already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early were either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Dexter information I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYour profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him how how\nAnd shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd foreign how hurt focused ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one is trust building relationships but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through in and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with that and he would be able to begin seeing past the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that relationship in and of itself could be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that's not happening quickly and and they knew the full horror of a lot of the police of this ideology and the thing is that dark headset Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWhich sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... one of those kind of case yeah\nJews working their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid of beliefs Jews are at the top and enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and\nI are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and\nSo ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews that was all but wiped out by the Holocaust in Bergen doubts and and that was the definitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by a fight by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\n... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek it also learned German because of his very divergent family history and the fact that the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans didn't learn because of", "year": "2018", "show_name":
