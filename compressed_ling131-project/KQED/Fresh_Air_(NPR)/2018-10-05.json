than today it's six and a half and now after seven o'clock that evening\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross last week Facebook announced the most serious security breach in the company's history in which an unknown hacker was able to log onto the accounts of at least Fifteen million Facebook users but that's just one element of the crisis facing the world's largest social media platform\nFacebook was the conduit for Russian backed disinformation campaign and the twenty sixteen election that reach tens of millions of users\nAnd the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica got access to their personal information of eighty seven million Facebook users which they used to target messages for the Trump campaign\nFacebook is now under investigation by the FBI the securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Trade commission and us already is in Europe and Australia\nOur guest New Yorker staff writer Evan Austin is explores Facebook's history and profiles it's thirty four year old founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a recent issue of the magazine\nHe says ... relentless drive to expand Facebook's reach has jeopardized the privacy of its users and made it vulnerable to political manipulation\nHis story is titled ghost in the machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy he spoke with fresh air is Dave Davies\nWhile Evan us welcome back to the fresh air you know we all know Facebook is a very big deal give us a sense of its size and reach\nThere's really nothing quite like it in the history of American business uh it is now to point two billion monthly active users meaning it's larger than any country in the world it's really got no I'm no natural precedent when you look at the history of enterprise it's really closer in terms of scale and reach to\nA political ideology or religious faith I mean it just didn't literal terms it now has as many adherents or as Christianity and that is all been built in the last fourteen years since it was founded in two thousand for\n... for this piece you visited Mark Zuckerberg at his home at his office had numerous meetings a lot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists to getting connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with you\nHe did it I should say reluctantly um this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I should look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this for a big powerful company\nUm and I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president\nAnd ah as that accumulated I continue to say look this fundamentally should be about how Mark Zuckerberg sees the world and over time they came to I think sort of grudgingly and I but I'm I'm grateful for it\nChange for Facebook traditionally it's former executives had been silent they leave the company and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who is Facebook's first president ... sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he's become a conscientious objector to social media he said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth and vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong that our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executives come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call external and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decreased sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they are trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is Annette ... and the company has been done to acknowledge\nCompany has been done to acknowledge it hurt for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively if you're just sitting there scrolling with glaze dies hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you\nAnd so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively communicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key\nDifference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that anymore\nYou know you talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that as he regard this kind of experimentation\nWell he absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he hasn't in some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and [noise]\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a uh to to get out into the world\nI'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but over time eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond his comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had\nA civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary member of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being bold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm he\nDid and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel\nThe same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nA and people said that's ... that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states it's and it's really embedded in the bill of rights and um his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people\nFurther there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be\nAggressively transparent in order 'em to be modern this the sense was as one person to put it um you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private solves in our public solves\nBut that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed\nThat being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and their their ... their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world that\nAlmost like redefining what it is to be him [laughter]\nYeah they believed that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you have this almost messianic\nSense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building computer applications you were actually building tools that were fundamentally reshaping society and they embrace that wholeheartedly\n[noise] there was a recent data breach at Facebook where fifty million users information was taken by somebody how how serious a problem as this\nIs a serious one this is the largest security breach in Facebook's history and what was unusual about this and what sets it apart from other cases like Cambridge Analytica was that this was outright fast this was a case of hackers or hacker we still don't know who it was um [noise]\nFinding essentially an an under protected door and walking through it and taking control of\nAt least fifty million ... Facebook user accounts or Facebook also I'm to be safe or took another forty million users in and kick them off the force them to log back in so it may be as many as Ninety million or more that were affected by this and and in this case the hackers were able to get total control\nThe accounts so ah there they were able to get control of your privacy settings that could go into your messages they could postings on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers\nDoing that out so that only heightens the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who studied the history of ... what is it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they would have they would have probably investigated it more and\nOn public with this as fast as they did they would if they would've\nProbably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they had to talk about this breach or really before they know very much about it so it's it's raises many questions as if the answer at this point\nWe're listening to the interview fresh as Dave Davies recorded with ... a staff writer for the New Yorker I've noticed this article about Facebook is titled goes for him and machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy we'll hear more of the interview after a break\nAnd Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nThan you've our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the law firms who we El Al ... with offices in the U.S and Europe and China cruelly advises entrepreneur yours investors financial institutions have established companies around the world where innovation make the law and from CBS TV\nCandice Bergen returned to CBS has Murphy Brown\nKansas is joined by the original cast and the show's\nCreator Diane English new episodes of Murphy Brown premier tonight on CBS\nSupport for ... comes from the city national bank working to help businesses entrepreneurs and their families for over sixty years city national bank the way up learn more at C.

got some access than it's worth\nThe time that if I live in Sacramento with ten thousand people [noise]\n[noise] we're speaking with Evan ... a staff writer for the New Yorker his piece about Martin Zucker Bergen Facebook ghost in the machine was in a recent issue of the magazine\nSo when word began to emerge about the spread of false information on Facebook or some of it by ... by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency and Russia um how did sucker bird respond to this\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might have affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were in [noise]\nSince then um\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here\nI'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case they\nInitially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation and and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation and what's remarkable about that is is how efficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin\nHad fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project and yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook\nUsers that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had this this positive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction right\nUm and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's right um so the company was in big trouble ...\nWent before Congress carefully ... of course how did he do\nWell there was a lot riding on that appearance I you know in many ways a kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and there was growing calls for regulation and\n... he in some ways vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point or an hacks senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\nSecretary kind of 'em gave a little smile and said senator we run ads that it was such an obvious fact anybody who's paid attention to technology that it really I think under scored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies\nAnd Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the posts that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same out to everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known a adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of business success\nThey they just stumbled on something that was I'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back over and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the the content that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approach the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye career you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company I'm doing this\nIt's become this consuming effort or Facebook over the last year as a as a controversy has grown they've undertaken one initiative after another so when it comes to political life\nGrown they've undertaken one initiative after another so when it comes to political election\nUh advertising for instance what they said was okay even though for years we argued\nThat we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ad now we are going to not only do that but we're going to go farther than TV does we're going to let users be able to click on an ad and then no not only paid for it but what other ads to those people pay for and and who were they targeting\nUm they're also saying we're going to\nDo more to defend against the kind of disinformation campaigns what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior essentially\nUm misinformation it's distributed to try to shake elections not only the United states but in other countries and they've had to in in in many ways Dave it's almost like they've put a gun to take on some of the qualities of a government you know they've had to hire people who actually worked in the U.S government on things like misinformation\nUm in order to try to ferret out efforts by Russian officials were uh in one case there was an Iranian campaign to try to spread misinformation but what we don't know and really won't know until after\nThe midterm elections in the U.S and and the elections that come to follow our whether or not that's that's working um and I think what's interesting is so Facebook on has become much more public these days in terms of talking about when it find examples of disinformation it'll announced it will say we took down a group of\nRussian uh imposter who were seeking to affect American voting behavior for instance um\nBut that's either a sign that they're winning the battle or it's a sign that the battle has grown so much that they're going to continue to face this and and what I'm struck by is how much\nThe integrity in the credibility of elections now rests on the shoulders of individual employees inside a private company in California that's a very unusual situation for our democracy to be in\nBecause they can actually make distinctions above what what the public sees and what it doesn't\nYes yeah I mean they have to make very subtle choices will take for example the misinformation what is the definition of misinformation when it's somebody being wrong by accident and when it's somebody being wrong on purpose when are they trying to deceive large numbers of public\nThose kinds of very subtle things which are usually the province of the Supreme Court or of lawmakers are now being handled in conference rooms at Facebook and it's very complicated\nEvan us most is a staff writer for the New Yorker whose piece the ghost in the machine about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook appeared in recent issue we'll talk some more after a short break this is fresh air Mm\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with Evan ... he's a staff writer for the New Yorker his story ghost in the machine about Martin Zucker burg and Facebook appears in a recent issue of the magazine they recently took down the posts from Alex Jones of info worse ... ... ...\nYeah this was a a really an important case study in how Facebook skin to deal with it the most complicated problem in some sense which is content what are you simply do with the fact that people are posting a billion items of content to Facebook every day that's the actual number and\nWhat they've tried to do is to say okay we're we're going to punish hate speech we're going to prevent hate speech from being on here um but for things that are less than hate speech if it's just misinformation or things that appear to be wrong by accent well then we're not going to ban that person from Facebook we're going to try to use other tools we may\nMake their posts less visible we might share the west\nHave to ...

smallest slip and um but I felt it deep in my the back of my hips hamstring area [noise]\nAnd I thought oh I tore my hamstring or I told them I ... I didn't imagine it would be a terror and I couldn't do certain dances that season I did some I didn't do the ones I was really well known for and wanted to do\nAnd I waited a few months I'm going to stretch it still danced but just at a certain level and then within\nThree months I could include fifth edition\nAnd fifth position if you don't know ballet is the base of ballet it's the most basic position that everything moved from and I literally couldn't do that\nSo that was a big [noise] and I tried everything I tried acupuncture I tried I was going to therapy I tried massage I tried I everything you can imagine had injections [noise] um MRI um and then I came back and said there was inflammation in my hand\nSo I had my hip drained and the doctor and I also did an ultrasound and he said oh I see a complex labor will tear care what do you mean a care\nHow could I get a tattoo [laughter] you know and I'm sure the ... was there forever I just didn't know it and until it was discovered and or had gotten to a place that it was I'm meeting to be fixed [noise]\nSo I contemplate surgery\nContemplate surgery contemplated everything I could do to avoid surgery and ultimately about Mm\nEight months later I was on the operating table getting reconstructive surgery the doctor didn't know to what degree the hip injury was when I went into the surgery and I'm not a one and a half hour or two hours surgery ended up being a four hour surgery and\nAfter the surgery I was a I couldn't wait there for two months it was on crutches for two months and I was I'm\nVery often in a a machine that kept my uh the circulation going in my leg so that we could try to build new cartilage grown cartilage um\nI did the best I could do to rehabilitate myself and um got back slowly and still had troubles and try to figure it out [noise] nine months later I got back on stage um\nAnd and performed a few more months and then I retired from the New York city ballet\n[noise] how do you change your relationship to your body you be in pain and to not know if your body was going to work properly again your body as your source [noise]\nUh the source of your pride the source of your work the source of your identity as a dancer and it's also just like your home I mean we all live in our bodies that your body is like a very special body\nDefinitely it was my home it was my best friend [laughter] you know and we could talk we could fight and we always found way to make\nPeace um throughout my career um\nYou know it started to tell me what to do and I stopped demanding from it\nSo I had to soften up and empathize with my body and have a little more compassion for it and be grateful for what it did give me which was a phenomenal thirty year career with arguably the best company in the world\n[noise] you know a lot of people think ballet as being um the ultimate in like\nFemininity and like [laughter] I think kind of femininity like really to to your approach in New York City ballet was uh some like more of an extreme sport I mean you got your body into shapes and angles and doing jumps in getting lifted in ways that truly seemed to defy the laws of gravity\nAnd defies the laws of what the body as physically capable of\nUm would you describe a little for people who have not seen you dance some of the things that you did that were worse so a typical for you but not typical for others\nRight well I can take it back to when I was a kid um I was a very athletic child very energetic child and that's why I started dancing because a little too much energy is my mom said let's get the middle one the middle child out of the house in the afternoons sticker somewhere where she can release energy so [noise]\nBut me into ballet and um and my mom was a basketball coach a college women's basketball coach so very serious a\nBasket ball family um I wanted to be an athlete first um I wanted to also be an artist I was a really good at drawing and I wanted I wanted to either grow up and be an athlete or an artist unbeknownst to me ballet which both [laughter]\nAnd again when I very first saw the nutcracker the dance that appeal to me was not the sugar plums very it was not the fault of the flowers that was the Arabian dance it was the muscular this than us [noise]\nUm more almost modern dance of the nutcracker that's the part I wanted to be I didn't care for the paint that's a valley I never did\nI was drawing immediately as a student at the school's American ballet to seeing my first performances of the New York city ballet my first bally's I loved where\nThe ... valleys and a lot of those driven ski bally's have a lucky quality or up pulled out quality are very angular quality something that's not soft something that's not\nUm voluptuous in a
