recorder\nAnd I kind of ... her with my my maybe we should say uh where are you\nAt this is Cathy I sorry I don't know what you might need to get my name's yeah [noise] that's probably the easy question I I'm Catherine Rampell economics in Washington\nThe typically captured writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop to use the perfect place to show this thing that in Syria [noise] All right\nSo you're looking at an IT what size you looking for\nAnd I can see now I see [noise]\nHow much of anything that's on the board to eighty nine [noise]\nA little misleading\nOkay so maybe this sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay\nTax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it with Catherine ... here is one price on the board and then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it and it's not just taxes\nSometimes it's fees and service charges that seem to ... out of thin air at check out and drive us all crazy looking rental cars buying concert tickets\nFor like have you looked at a hotel room recently sometimes there's an Internet feed symptoms of the parking fee sometimes there's something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that is not a resort it's by the highway\nAnyway Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompanies should be competing based on price and quality and not operation a and the fact that companies do compete on application did not create a better economy does not creator got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for\nConsumers that are buying stuff that they don't want to put everyone has a used car salesman\nI have a very good friend who's a used car salesman so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nCatch up Steve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch a rule\nIn baseball and works his father who's a that if you're the team ahead in an inning and you're at bat then you get only two hunks rather than three outs in that ending\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand we went back to Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyze a\nEach pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the catch a robot been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much\nOrder what these games than the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost a half an hour from a game and a half an hour of the game\nYes and not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's\nAlso got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nSo yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving\nSport oh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd give them only Eighteen seconds at the end of the game home like wow you were a true iconoclast well [laughter]\nWe'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor that's

the most popular yogurt branch in the United states\nAnd one thing about starting to build the co founder Gary Hertzberg is that you know he didn't really set out to build a company he\nKnew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire his dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days there were probably fifty shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont so\nSo how many people did your dad's company employ\nSeveral thousand I think at their peak they were twenty eight hundred wow these are true company town of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in in the region in the country were were built on things that we made\nThe dark side of that is that when they simply because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed you know all these communities as well\nAnd what happened to your family [noise] uh well it was really a free a free for uh the family's business uh went bankrupt um my parents got divorced\nAnd my uh\nSearch childhood role model a died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a it was a wake up\nHere ... yeah I um my father I got a began drinking ... um [noise] and so I had to sort of confront all of that and yeah you know my mom became\nA single mom with five kids I was the oldest so dislike\nMajor change in your life happens at the age of fourteen which of course it's going to have an impact an influence on you did you did you start to think about a business about being a businessman at that early I mean do you have parents who are both entrepreneurial\nYou know through a dart at the Weill figured out the value of the business\nWill what is your value but at the time [laughter] well we thought we were going to value at at a million dollars but then in Nineteen eighty four our sales were up to around two hundred fifty thousand a year\nAnd this is just in in New Hampshire or all over New England\nWell by eighty four we were starting to push the boundaries\nWere selling to about twenty stores and eventually started selling to a an independent grocer who had seven stores and uh this will give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one Sunday night\nWe were having dinner at the Caymans after milking and the phone rang and a ... the nephew of the owner of the ... market basket chain ... calls and says Samuel or why are you selling to my competitors and not to me\nNow he had thirty four stores at the time and that meant that well to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cash he said well get some more\nCows than he planned the phone down and we took that is very good business advice so we went out and grew are heard even further and then so we\nNow realize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed to at least some small refrigerator trucks and started delivering actually to the market basket where where how\nHow much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing now about three hundred and sixty cases in a week of yogurt and cases like twenty four cups\nSix ... six packs of court and so by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed in the sort of half a million dollar range but you\nWere probably spending more money than you are bringing in right\nOh my God you have no idea yeah we were burning I mean I kept not weekly cash and blood knot daily casually I kept hourly capitalism yeah I knew on a Wednesday morning how much money I had to come in that afternoon in order for us because by then the guy had figured out\nWho you know semi wasn't paying them so now we were on very short terms with everybody I mean my fundraising skills turned out to be you know I mean we'd be nowhere without Samuels yogurt making skills and his family is unbelievable attention to detail they were perfectionist are but we were also we would also be

Samuel ends stony field are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nIn those days it's a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three star chain called bread and circus which eventually became part of ... and they had one store in Cambridge prospect street and you know we were selling now to Melissa market basket just as now I'm Talking July of eighty\nFour and um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we can crack\nBread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to ... in the Tea Party with their ... do you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in a hamster [laughter]\nBut you guys do\nSo in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the patron or

yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circus and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles this last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get it on people's mouths and then they're going to ask for it and and this is\nA right around the time you meet Maggie who would become your wife right\nYeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no sometimes northeastern affirming association conference and I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and the right after I finished my speech this very\nAdorable or organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there I waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state\nSo she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she learned to a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later ... well I think we can increase it says she increase to a hundred and eventually I got to cross the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm it's because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some harbored MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's many huh yeah yeah and so now we worked\nFor our moms which must have been pretty stressful\nOh yeah you know what happened in this farmhouse I always had payroll on Thursday mornings at at this point it was a half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking ... was a sleep\nIn our bedroom which was about fifty feet from my office I Would on many occasions tiptoe over to the office to call my mother in law to have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty\nFive hundred to make ends meet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click on call waiting on my mother in law's fun and Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because I was because she didn't have confidence in\nWhat looks she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out that the power would I mean we're in the ... from a long way from anywhere\nWas make things do you listen to ... ditch this thing that the bag it I mean or or did she

Kim Fields and be like oh okay cool so I can kinda see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah as you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight do than for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how did you try to overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nThat everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies grade moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self doubt come and so I think what I have done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in a house I make it is not about a number\nLike I don't have a skill in a house I make it is not about a number\nIf you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans I feel more powerful the little\nBit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots and again these are champagne problems I just went up ...

about\nMan is like your your amazing and then\nThat would make me realize I'm amazing and then we will have this happy life together\nAnd so that was like one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship to sort of define\nMe or make me realize that I'm lovable I just had to sort of\nFigure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I haven't like found my soul mate or my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you
