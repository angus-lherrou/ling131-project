and do this looks like it's working out what the hell you can come home you know that when they get work please\nI can do some research and do research you got to help me do you think that you have this under control and I ...\nI understand why do things with me any difference alright I'm attracts craziness huge just embarrassed 'cause I was like you know I don't think it's amazing thing that you're special ... or something and you don't like who I Am now who are your neck of the day here and this is why I Am\nToday we'll hear parts of terrorists interviews with the chefs first her conversation with David and Nick chef recorded in two thousand date she started with a question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how your son's personality changed when he was using that\nHe he became unrecognizable or he went from being\nYou know just one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew\nAnd she became this coast a sort of coming in and out of the house or physically he changed your he lost your skin and bugs and he was\nJittery and and then his behavior changed I mean he went from being as I said this sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was ... he became belligerent and\nAngry and depressed and argumentative and he did things that were just inconceivable that he would do\n\nThis is fresh air let's get back to tear each interview with David shift in his son Nick chef they both written memoirs about coping with mixed addiction to methamphetamines memoirs which are the basis of a new film beautiful boy starring Steve Carell\n[noise] I I think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was called ... in in the alcoholics anonymous model\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how you you you were are still are in an atheist and raising the without religions um did\nYour eye to eye to felt guilty that you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was like I Would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those principles including the first one which is you know\nNick didn't agree for a long time it's just that but he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing\nYou know in twelve step program an undercover I think it it it is a huge problem because I Try I spend a lot of time and they're trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make\nMyself you know come to believe and ultimately you know when I sit with myself in the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone you know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are\nJust fundamentally you don't believe in God or any reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nBut the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important that we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get healthier and sober\nWe learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get healthy and sober and to stop using the first thing that they're telling me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought they expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic\nAnd the guy said wait let's let's you know why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that that I mean you know that's what he says that those three months were essential\nTo do that program not you not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and now it's a part of that but um\nThere's a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and answer every experience some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them enough for the first time really allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all now I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but as for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power\nI learned to define that in in a way that worked for me which is a it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray\nI'm going to do what they told me about all of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through [noise] ... what is being mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was a it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be it way just to stay sane intersect focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's I'm not part of what saved you from your math addiction was it degree self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think was do we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting medication can deal with a diagnosis\nYes I I mean after you know it's a ... I think it's like\nVery very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's yeah it's ... I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily you know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle\nIn terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome I certainly\nA Nick tells a story in his book that to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see us I'm Karen like my wife and Jasper and daisy\nOr we were in this we haven't seen that for a long time in in ... and said you know let's let's go next to join us we're going to family vacation and then they came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what they've been going on and was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that's I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and we had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed by you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I'm leaving oh and that's what's going on here I'm studying my I I don't really want to leave part of me wants to stay here\nAnd be a child is going to be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... ... and then all of a sudden he said that he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and then he went back in the rest of the trip was was great we had a really nice last day but then he said what just happened he says another time in my life that moment\nWould have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of dissent that would've ended up and they're going to have a drink or to get some pot and then it's a mess and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together\nWell listen congratulations to both of you on on on the

mess has been made into a movie starring Steve ...\nIs your child under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nIn most places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy in some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals like people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks\nBut um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other ways but whatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what was the other way well sometimes nickel just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know Dr either a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time they relapse you know he's been sober for a long time it was after Nick and I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of vodka then I took one I thought to myself\nJust one which is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week so he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the hills and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in a freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so so when they got an airplane that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so\nAh it shows that it's possible if people think the treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit of that

the ... step program so I think most people know what the positive\nUh parts are but what are some of the problems you have time to stop\nThe twelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but\nNot most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it it's forced in many places Nicolas kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embraced the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative but I did go to Alan on meetings\nAnd what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people told me over and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings got Al Anon meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and thing I'm not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too\nSo that comfort in that support was for found for me\nGoing into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to you know put on his face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I have to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as when I was able to cry and I was able to you know there was no pretense and those rooms there was this openness\nIt didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the days\nWere sitting on a positive note

prejudiced but he\nHit extraordinary who's just this lovely person that he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know with kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gone into recovery\nIs really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh
