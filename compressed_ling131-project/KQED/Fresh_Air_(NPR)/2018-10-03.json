were adopted into films and\nThe undoing project Lewis lifted Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions in the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis has a fellow by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseen well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to fresh air explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is the risk that you failed to imagine it's these while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government try to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what am I asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of this so I thought that's the moment where the mind fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under com focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the ... now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nWas the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration had gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of like a fire under me when I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing especially the best course than it ever been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings and nobody showed up nobody to Britain in many cases when I go get get get these briefings on the first person to have got them\nAnd I thought well this enterprises managing all these risks it imagines that we as a society to spend much time thinking about um if it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought what happens when you do that across a big ports\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers\nHis new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise]\nYou know I'm an English so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um that Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on that department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you right about now agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on but it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a triple a prize the society we ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been suggested the decades and decades of\nOf abuse and score and it's collected Ross and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much ... nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know what aspect of the fifth risk is the go\nA lot of the risk that the government managers are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up uh\nYou know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and ruin lives and another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been frost is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening as a department level that kind of level of government where things are being done where conditions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about innocence threats atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli\nNoah first of all what are you doing in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent of the two sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know what each the Commerce Department and they simply do National Weather service night as a National Weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no ... and how do they get their back\nIn the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War Nick Nixon got ticked\nOff and just shoved into the Commerce Department as an actor vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department [noise] uh and it does ... each most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical\nAnd er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather uh that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a weather predictions surface\n[noise] well I'm\nSo here's the problem ah typically the person who runs no or as as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation\nUm the problem is that the national weather service uh\nWhich has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver di di di you\nThat saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a\nHas been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather can do it instead\nAnd that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress just sexually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that well in the first place if the the ... the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that it makes it available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts\nBut what he's been trying to do is organized sexually a card of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all the needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is a naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now [noise]\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break and Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancers for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual cancer and revealed possible treatment option learn more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com and from ...

green\nAnd it's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards a who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as they're attacking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre still so betrayed by what\nColor is sending its ideology ally that I'd have a career in in ...\nPanned out she said and the bills are either an idea\nShocking or if I'm going to some for our ambivalent about Africa [noise]\nDon't know you're not because you realize that the voters leaving the dog was\nBefore you took changing the deadline lumber oh yeah oh we'll start as soon as I finish the play\nRight after I get the story published I finished the book he blaming me knowing awful [noise] I I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation\nA lot of women has been hit forty one I thought I could to\n[noise]\nI just don't think a Florida started was false every character pregnant [noise]\nI guess it is I've been reading my book [noise]\nI didn't say that all the doctors that we're talking about a lie it\nBad for the turtle a my old egg and one of the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise you're starting to look like\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose not\nSo that was Catherine ... and Paul Giamatti and a scene from\nAs Catherine hunt and pulled your body and a scene from my guest camera Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah\nYou mean blaming myself yeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my and catch on\nIn your head having that argument with yourself\nYeah I think I was I think that that's fair I kind of um you know how did I ended up here I mean\nHer blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this was a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why\nShe feels betrayed by some notion of like a you know be independent and you don't\nNeed you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori time ever said that exactly you know she is you really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of like a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available\nTo her I think for a lot of women when you're trying\nTo reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of\nBecoming I mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means in sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird\nFamily also played an impact which isn't really you know ... that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the you know pursuing\nA career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life which

also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo they're spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you are forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\nYeah I mean she was also and he was many many character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character as your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about oh you know ... you know oh honey you know well if you just give that to your grandfather\nAnd I started to correct the person\nUh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my\nGrandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was ...\nMhm and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seem like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his suit and and had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character\nSo you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise]\nI'm In part because of the dementia and part because he's just not\nYou didn't get picked him as the appreciative type 'em right and there isn't a strange men\nNeed between you between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent at during that time has made you so focused\nYou know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there's actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with their mother we live with our father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ...\nWe moved away from living on my dad's plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother has ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Mary in high school for a second and then um she was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parent\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother [laughter] you know getting a PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and\n[noise] um ...\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know ... the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent\nAnd having hostile relationships with our landlords because my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was really late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother\nShe would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food in the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um\nFood food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on the ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off massive so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students [noise]\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah yeah it was just a book Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there were you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting the extremes like twenty five was crazy I mean there was an amazing sacrifice and\nI've just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at this poll and the stuff out\nDr gross [laughter] enough that that that even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary and in a way all of these movies are sort of like that [noise]\nWhatever jak as it's great to have you back on our show thank you so much thank you\nTimer Jenkins wrote and directed the new movie private life it opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday she also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters\nAfter a break Marine Corps again will review the new memoir heartland about growing up just below the poverty line in a family that had been family farmers in rural Kansas I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "03"}
