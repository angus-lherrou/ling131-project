stare into ... and\nRobinson's book you can touch my hair and other things I still have to explain was the best seller her new book everything's trashed but it's okay it's a series of funny

single again and then being in a relationship again and what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationship\nPhoebe Robinson welcome the fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started and comedy about eight years ago ten years they're near OK okay what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you\nAnd then I think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women some people's color a few where people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of times standup feels incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience\n[noise] yeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can acres is that allowed now have to believe it too so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not little Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\n\nI'm Sorry I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a lot of ... we did our why key why tour across America and we were both kind of being like\nOh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves as whole freaking time at a law that has been informed by the fact that we have different energy that allowed the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell a joke in a different way or different style\nWhenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think sometimes people fully understand\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a to do queens that would have been a game changer\nFor me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like the young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about oh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did that to my hair like totally like messed it up I can talk about\nMy black hair woes and high school with like Laura she doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has to be flawless like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be okay with be out\nNumbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows\nWhere you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... Kim Fields and be like oh okay cool so I can kinda see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah as you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight do than for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how did you try to overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been\nExpected to conform to certain body\nOf how women have been\nExpected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place than you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings I\nThink that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies grade moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still make that self doubt come and so I think what I have done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a scale in a house I make it is not about a number\nIf you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans I feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots\nAnd again these are champagne problems I just went up ... I Know that but there there'll be like oh yeah we have a size four\nAnd it's like that is unacceptable to me to only have a size\nFour is truly ignorant and inexcusable or I go to these like shoots and I tell people\nI'm a ten twelve that's just what it is and there'll be like here's a six it's like how dare you\nTruly it's like how dare you be like oh we'll be confiding in your size you didn't look 'cause I dress myself every day I dress myself every day and I find everything I Need to have\nThis sort of oh well we only have a zero to four so you either ... or you're you're screwed is not how you should treat anybody I Would do these video games and Ninety percent of the stuff I wouldn't fit into and every time I didn't fit in something like I'm Sorry\nThe Apollo time I would apologize after every single ... I'm so sorry and Mike they knew what size I was four weeks before I showed up I it is\nNot my fault I'm decides that I Am\n[noise] there's an afterword an addendum to your book in part of your book is about being single and the ups and downs of being single and then he had done them as I have a boyfriend now well [laughter] had to be after the time I turn this into my book editor so you're still together\nYes we are still together we um we're going we're what Fifteen months sixteen months I'm pretending like it's a child or a few months are doing very um and we just moved in together with

I Do my terrible British act and all the time for him and he he loves it but not at all [laughter] so you're a\nSingle for at least two years in between your areas boyfriend and the person who you're with now what have you learned about yourself from the periods where you you were single and lived alone\n[noise] um before I met British bake off that's what we call him up before I met him I really just was I really love romantic comedies and I I really was like\nWanted to have that moment in my life where I'm like dating this guy and then he just as like gives his\nVerbal approval or whatever about man is like your your amazing and then that would make me realize I'm amazing and then we will have this happy\nLife together and so that was one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship\nTo sort of define me or make me realize that I'm lovable\nJust had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I haven't like found my soul mate on my partner by the end of that means that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself\nAnd it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never once they checking to see how I felt about myself did you have to learn\nHow to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to go into a movie by herself or having dinner by herself [noise] um and I just feel like I'm consuming this I'm watching this and I don't need somebody with me to fully appreciate the experience\nAbsolutely I mean I I did all that stuff where I just and you always think like you go out to like a diner or a movie you go by yourself and you think everyone is just like dropping like you're at a restaurant everyone's dropping therefore they're going there is a woman thing by herself\nAnd they're all like focus on their ... they are not thinking about you you know and it was just was so sort of like self absorbed Ron Mike everyone's judge me for being single and yes there are certain people and everyone's lives will like judge them for being

she says Washington Black is a visit travel up through some strange territory\n... new novel Washington Black opens on wretched terrain that will be familiar to anyone who's read slave narratives the year is Eighteen thirty the location is a sugar plantation in Barbados\nOur narrator and in sleeved eleven year old boy named George Washington black wash\nFor short tells us that the old master has recently died washes now standing to attention as a carriage carrying his new master arrives he's a pale sinister looking man named Erasmus wild\nLooking at him wash comments he owned me as he owned all those I Lived among not only our lives but also our debts and that pleased him too much\nReaders will naturally anticipate that a tale of brutalities small moments of grace and for war did escape attempts will follow except that's not quite what happens\nIn short order to escape attempts here are successful\nWash breaks away from that plantation the hot air balloon no less\nAnd ... also breaks away in her case leaving behind the confines of the conventional historical novel and transporting readers into the ... the realms of romantic era travelogue and scientific exploration\nIn Washington Black ... has created a wonder of an adventure story powered by the helium a fantasy but also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation the new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage his younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights\nHe turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nPitch in lifts wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that wash possesses a skill for executing detailed scientific drawings\nThe color line the to strike up a kind of friendship\nSo much so that when it seems likely that watch will be killed in wrongful retaliation for the death of a white visitor to the plantation\nPitch fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cover ... earth and together the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime sky\nI began to cry recalls wash thinking of this extraordinary moment\nThe air grew colder crept in webs across my skin all was shadow red light storm fire and frenzy and up we went into the eye of it untouched miraculous\nIf only that escape or the soaring conclusion to wash his adventures not just the beginning\nBut inevitably the friends attempt to float above the consequences of race springs elite and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nCertainly much of the pleasure of reading Washington Black derives from ... ingenious storytelling gifts but her novel is more than just a boy in vulnerable\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from ... elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to later exhibits\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long seen science as the great equalizer washed says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd given to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often touching novel about the search for transcendence above categories as she tries to do for her hero watch and see huge and clearly aims to carry her readers up up and away\nOr encouraging teaches literature at Georgetown University she reviewed Washington Black by se ... and now they're going to hear an interview with ... and she's a

who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field work around this plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild it goes by such there's a lot of nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes wash his life forever because a bond forms between him and this was white man church um and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in the end this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand his arrows stat or which is you know kind of cruelty in itself to to look at somebody and I think that of them that then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gets sick he has no\nNo idea you know that this\nThis young man is just completely you just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a pretense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under ... [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore and into ... character\nIs you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and and notions\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist though he truly has a very\nGeneral belief in the rights of man it's kind of very prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his\nA philosophy a adult life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel a great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy and his personality that so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash a scape from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slavery the slave economy\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that can teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in light and ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know and I think he has a sense of himself as being quite a moral person and [noise]\nGo to us us leader looks like a fender bender here on north when one after Spencer avenue both vehicles made it to the right hand shoulder\nBeyond the look at it yeah Martinez highway for eastbound after Alhambra avenue someone drop their ladder there in the right lane and a woman a creek it's a mattress six eighty southbound actress south main street avoid that she and the two right lanes Julie ...

nano sensor and my grandfather\nJust be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like to put an inconvenience to the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and\nThey're going to say sorry no smoke [laughter] he died of lung cancer die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding story was that Sunday\nAnd the most leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife should be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom\nAnd you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her oh gosh that's dangerous they were so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people when they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always frauds a ... surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to draw up because\nLink key monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies which was lowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and and yes they are in there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know writing out scenes is one thing I mean you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but catching up this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone but the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help the ... are you seeing someone who's talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's weird for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawing\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these ... he knew how absorbed you more with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to kill your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was gonna get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\nAnd so she as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that like a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally at and in that moment ah and and back then this was the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dressed somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did but upset but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comic flux Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot of a gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know that's the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think page one should be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter]

clean and sober together but when he died and then she took care of my grandfather summer than he died and then she started hanging out with other people I just knew it was going to be a downward spiral and\nWhen I saw her at a book event of mine um she she had all of his track marks on the back of her hands on her arm and she she blamed on the dog jumping up on her but I just knew my heart I knew and oh surely after my second child was born\nA this was December of two thousand and eleven she started getting arrested again and so in January of two thousand twelve\nHolly who was who she is my aunt's by lineage but my sister or by heart and soul called me on the phone and she said did you see the paper today\nAs a hobby I live in North Hampton I live in our in western noise in the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies\nAnd I went in person to talk to my mother had her for court date and she she has she assured me that she was not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money and I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here\nAnd I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know why I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd uh and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and\nSins or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to run them she did spend a little bit of time in jail again or the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will and you know you do ... I Would worry I wake up in the middle of the night thinking\nWhat if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a longing to Troy process from really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd Arthur there's her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd go to eat on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise] and and I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated but I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like lick you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home\nSo I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that she would worth address ... to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had plane that was a response or you know I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they certainly wouldn't be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks for shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom make my mom beautiful again that I answered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and tourniquets and and all all of her drug paraphernalia\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know what there's a there's a feeder closet and this other woman right yeah of course\nA dress that was that important to her she would preserve and\nThe cedar closet so I ...
