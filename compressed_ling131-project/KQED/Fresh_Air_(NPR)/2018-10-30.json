shot and killed at least eleven congregants at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how our views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement poses and I guess ... I was a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nAnd focus is on the story of Derek Black\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan\nCreated the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nIn a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\nHe likes Sasha welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book ... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he\nDid not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that\nBut do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert hours\nI think you can draw a straight line from Don views and dawn's working this movement to view the crushed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooter spotty yet a tattoo fourteen eighty eight to white\nNational slogans fourteen or first throughout a fourteen word sort of statement a purpose that is central to what started frog does about em securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children and\nSaying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language in the motivation to exist on store front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race for that they believe is under way\nYeah it was a I'm a ... hours had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek worst central to the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was it instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal for white people\nBy the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people or you know it's it's a ludicrous idea but unfortunately it's had huge purchasing this movement and now white genocide I Would say is\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front\nTo the shooting at synagogue um instilling friend is an insight that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial or you're a and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh\nYou know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that's well this probably isn't quite the way to go about it's a he went a little too\nFar and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our global with and that choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to\nBring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get\nFrustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\nSo have you spoken with either done are guaranteed black since the shooting at the Pentagon yesterday\nI've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular icing on the movement said to then have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and\nLeave that building thing the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young\nFor years and your your wife and I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked fast slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist fight storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\n... in in ... and ... and ... no no no\nNo no no no [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air their social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe'd like to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now seeing those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nGarrett black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included Sasha so the first question was addressed to black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race it's\nLike yeah my dad popularized the term white nationalism is that what you're saying\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was as far as it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and now that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nDo they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the\n... that's the word [noise] um racial less racial out all\nOver the years if you look at the language in terms of how many people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think affective we identified a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett lack of

little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and why\nI was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the endpoint at the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races and different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea that\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing fits that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we wanted to find who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion and the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former white nationalist leader and Washington

nationalist leader who announced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred so you're one of the things you did you had been home schooled\nSo you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida they were Jewish people their initial he tried to hide your identity and then you could you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] your place of publication with an article by you in a gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black\nTill after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish gay and who were very upset when they found that he really are um you have Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who dated if we didn't initially no was Jewish\nUm what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you that made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew Shabaab dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every ... other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him\nIs talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about what we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general at being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast staring out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through in and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that's not happening quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the least of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that he said about Jews and and ... yeah [noise]\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and\nAre are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and so ... had

on learning some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered buying an escape or now\nI landed a kick foot in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive\nPart of my life let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation\nIt's said among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he starred in\nAfter the break this is fresh air and [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad\nMoney ball and the wolf of Wall Street\nI Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting then\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early ...\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah\nLet's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignore the content matter if certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and I wrote The Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think\nIs a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the\nCharacters from the godfather and the characters in The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho was who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because at the nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nNo excuse me she's Michael Sallah OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNow Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nI'd like to ask Diane Keaton vice [laughter] why are you going to go the jet you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the and fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend to think\nAbout story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you a story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine than when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look see the film magazines I was just so interested so\nI Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kid was a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burning the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York\nThis is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older than I understood\nThe HIV aids plot Marta ... because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] disturbing and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a ... I Want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this for a reason yeah and then I of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess this Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement\nI'm Terry Gross and there's this fresh air [noise]\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitments are sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise] support\nFor

so the focus can remain on employees and customers are more business dot ... dot com [noise]\nYeah and and now like in the past I don't know ... years five six seven years you started playing more dramatic roles you know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out\nTo film directors that you are interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices\nYou know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part in Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... told me\nAnd then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir Moneyball\nAnd then in the interim ah\nI continue to do some comedy films that\nWere funny and fun and then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of operates\nAnd then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had\nA lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow\nThings in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really wants to do I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry Levinson or people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain enjoy of life\n[noise] why don't you hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter or who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm I'm based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny Adolf played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting\nUm so you start the scene [noise]\nAnd I try I Try and do\nActually see that call around\nYou know I think we live in a\nWhile for your for your for your fears fry everywhere [laughter] what do you do for [noise]\nI don't blame you for your\nGerms runs her own view so right [noise] there's a lot of money\nYou know do a risk for myself I'm trying to put it together from Mexico and build on just on my [noise]\nUnderstand how much money [noise]\nUnless Seventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious and unfair to [noise] there's almost one [noise]\nFor told you so many thousands of technically suddenly two thousand [noise]\nSo [noise]\nYou show me a taste for Seventy two thousand dollars I quit my job right now and I worked for your [noise]\nOur next fun it was when I quit\nAnd he quit his job was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets ... and so while the things about him to like phosphorus and white life I got to deal with your wife back to one rooms with clear lenses just to look more wash\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing with Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on all of Wall Street\n[noise] honestly so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior as people\nAnd the characters in his films often do really ugly things\nAnd you still find humanity in there and I like how\nUnabashedly an unapologetically she shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do and you're in a movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to me in art in general and something I'm going to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties\nIf we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean our country has a\nTerrible father yet right well I read it terrible fathers can be viewed but he also in Italy loving big hearted\nPerson right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area\nOkay so this weekend this Saturday you going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old he was with a step mother\nAt of any hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa Bayer\nAnd she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate\nAnd beyond the drive over my nightmares will take place in Syria and Terry Gross [noise]\nMaybe gets you don't want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay you say [laughter] but I was so shocked and in light of the name check on\nI was so shocked and in light of the name check on that show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to hear this moment oh it's just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that you have to listen to NPR thing which pouring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first time this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super back so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers is there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a go into a Benny hard on his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid leaned back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style I think I just started doing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\n[noise] well ... thank you so much for coming on the show it's been great to talk with you thank you to\nJonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties after we take a short break marine ... review a new book about Emmett Till a
