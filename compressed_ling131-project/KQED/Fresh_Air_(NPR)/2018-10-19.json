given to the times by a secret source the documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars\nFrom his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my gas or outright fraud\nSuzanne crab and David Barstow are two of the reporters that the New York times who wrote a long investigative article about the many tax maneuvers Fred Trump devised to passes vast fortunes onto his children\nSuzanne crank writes about the intersection of politics money and government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes\nIn response to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nThat needed a president or his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSuzanne crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here get a sense of French from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak\nFor Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York [noise] the strategy was the guy who build and sold his first home before you reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties she was really the biggest developers are actually in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class housing um whose homes which she built in his apartment buildings which we build him\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're kind of is no frills\nHome so she was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the the Henry Ford hum of building in Brooklyn and queens of his\nUh in so you have a mental skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties\nAre assigned to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs are they going to look at what's been written about before and they're all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his\nTelling us your story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and if he parlay that million dollar loan into a ten billion dollar empire and that remains for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold\nCertainly you know to make themselves a celebrity and to gain power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um in based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne crack and David ... of the New York times who wrote a a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct now hold Donald Trump math about how it is self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like\nSelf made millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money ... Donald's father\nFunneled to him and in other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to you and there's some of the tax schemes we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollars on from his father and help parlayed that into his\nIn his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars are quite a few hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw transferred to Don and what we what\nWe also saw what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never really paid you know he would take out [noise] um we were looking at one particular year it was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks on a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects were the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then of being off to the ... [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to get his father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his on investment\nIt also see that when his cell and then when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety ... was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nAnd the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case\nI'm Donald Trump's casinos they're facing a debt payment infrared Trump as a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casinos trips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money just to make a million dollars worth of it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's well centrally and knew well and it was caught us all to the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety infrared Trump immediately sees\nThis caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately turns now he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald lived to Seoul executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family what he did\n[noise] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own going to to help Donald Trump down himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt to bring his um to Jane complete control over his state in potentially to use the ... the\nEmpire that Fred Trump headed doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess they're New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after our break we'll talk about

published a long investigative article this month\nBut ... use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump measured in today's dollars out received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything Fred Trump still own at the time of his death wider Donald Trump make that decision\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFred Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe saw that in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meetings after for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell and quickly assembled a private sale to his developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo says that the the uh buildings that were spelled with those buildings ... Frank ... own at that time of his adult there are also include all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both of the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much go empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the documents that we went through the thoughts sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they've placed on villains who made the trumps pay for a few million more bucks on this returning assume for a million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and Jim extract\nA few million dollars that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nMost families who you know wealthy families are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who gauge in these very sophisticated maneuvers to\nAvoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more of the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard but budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in the state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nWhen public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or other combat [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well see publishers are come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and while we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet while you're doing\nGo shooting skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tracks schemes that we describe in the story so it's just a moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually cause it's perfectly with the moment when he was just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of the comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money that happened in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump built and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and has great negotiating deal making\nAbilities\nAnd so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to\nSort of go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stock and I think that we've\n... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents shop I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's\nAbsolutely true and the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents that the Trump family themselves um but I think it will take time for us to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times as basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access to wear locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who wasn't\nLoud [laughter] we uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little documents and [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was uh just\nThe three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy [laughter] for a little ...\nLittle ... too I Would imagine [laughter] and other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors do but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nYou know where it's been two weighty connect you ran to the two eighty extension of dealing with a vehicle fire here\nWho expected big backup to mission south when one before U.S South San Francisco exit is still a big rig takes away your rights lane very slow ... street and overturn vehicles center roasted says south em one one of the highways twelve that's out on his roof on the right hand shoulder Julie ...\nDe ... bye Bayh alarm and support for K. cue weedy comes from here technologies location intelligence company with a scalable and flexible location platform designed to power the emerging technologies of today and tomorrow learn more at ... dot com slash new reality [noise]\n'kay Q.

getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nCertain that the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important that we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get healthy and sober and to stop using the first thing that they're told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um countering the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by that he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that that I mean you know that's what he says that that those three months where central\nTo do that program not ... not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and now as a part of that but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and re experienced some of the traumas that I experienced drying up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know I've tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all now I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nHe did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power\n[noise] I I learned to to find that in in a way that worked for me which is a it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to Al Anon meetings I was told by someone before this is over you will believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said\nNow I live my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do with a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody mhm that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power [noise]\nI I learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is a it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before this was over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to\nPray I'm going to do what they told me but all of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through ... what does it mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to pray I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay Syrian intersect focused on something that you know that I can hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um what part of what saved you from your math addiction which it degree self knowledge they were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think was do we have in which you were diagnosed with bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression I'm\nGetting a diagnosis and then getting the medication ... diagnosis\nYes I I mean ... you know it's a ... I think it's like\nVery very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's you know it's there's subtle I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily\nYou know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome after they\nUh Nick tells a story in his book that to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um he came to see us I'm Karen like my wife and Jasper and daisy\nOr we were in this we haven't seen that for a long time in in terms of you know let's let's invite me to join us we were doing and the family vacation and send it came up with the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what we've been going on and was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that's was I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and we had a really good time and then she describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed when you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow are leaving oh I'm just what's going on here I was studying my I I don't really want to leave party wants to stay here\nAnd be a child is going to be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... and ... and then all of a sudden he said he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and and he went back in the rest of the trip was it was great we had a really nice last day but then he said what just happened he says another time in my life that moment\nWould have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of dissent there but it ended up and they're going out to have a drink or to get some of them and it's a mess and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together\nWell listen congratulations to both of you on on on

different and in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but if I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd done everything I could to get him into

Sheff his book clean is about the medical science of addiction and recovery his earlier book beautiful boy about his son Knicks addiction to mess has been made into a movie starring Steve Carell\nIf your child under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nIn most places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy but some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage you\nKnow he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks\nBut um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other wave but whatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes they would just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would yeah he he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time they relapse you know he's been sober for a long time it was after Nick and I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of vodka then I took one I thought to myself\nJust one which is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week so he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the hills and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so yeah when they've got an airplane that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so\nAh it shows that it's possible I mean people think the treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit of that twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in the ... program\nIs probably going to you know I I trust that program for parents Elena yeah yeah and then you visited them just as the search for the book to you see you see you know positives and negatives with it tough step program still I think most people know what the positive\nUh ... what are some of the problems you have to Austin\nSteps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's lonely many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the key but I'm the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embraced the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative but I did go to Alan on meetings\nAnd what I found there was something different that helped me you know when they became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one in ...\nSponsorship of the cake weedy live stream bite super like grow at Silicon Valley based

rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was for found for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to get my younger children data and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling and then I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this open if it didn't make things go away but it
