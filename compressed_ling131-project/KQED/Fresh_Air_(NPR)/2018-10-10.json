Chen or freedom theater at the gym at ... dot com\n[noise] uh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign\nThe\nCampaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced has Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered\nThen Hamas would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just a social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies if one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set of model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nActually they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message for residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities were not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve at the cost and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in\nTaylor Swiss army of ... you can list in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same\nBut the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at at crowd sources so to speak and one of the other tools of the trade one of the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the um ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion\nTo drive it to your own in the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it do the same way that Trump's online army which trying hijacked discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nListening to the interview fresh as they've Davies included with the W. singer and Emerson breaking authors of a new book like war the weaponization of social

on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of [noise]\nAnd they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the comment on hearing in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and it was in a certain way you hide both sides using\nThe exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military were using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd it wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Calvin all too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt\nThen you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the double gang or a narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath the sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side the narrative\nBe buried underneath you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view but history itself for at least the online place that we go to a stop Bush and learn about history we can ... so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian um actors go on to a PDF very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where I he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook there was sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he says no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on ... do you make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward it's going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they are now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks is part of this larger a area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just them back but maybe in some way surpassed I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad I for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of uh for example or the future of marketing or it's going to move into areas that are like customer service um the company see this also is away\nTo save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind to help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same ... chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a and convince someone to take a certain position on the war a certain way\nTo challenge also moved into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fakes\nThese are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies in turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help fight it help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are online where a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so these neural networks ... so I could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce the picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden offering some you know profane of combat it's something\nTo get real world example of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to ah George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that to meld together to allow you to a and create a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's\nGoing to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's going to be monetize for for profit and it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...

now he wrote and directed la la la land and whip lash and directed the new movie the first man starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ...\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think his music he actually brought with him to play after the space finding my right about that [noise]\nAh with the music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you refer yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah yeah\nSo it's it's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about of Virginia that's been described as exotic I but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with\nAll due respect inhale Armstrong like like Hollywood staff celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your ... to the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\n... version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a image mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\n... or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but did you know strange little less Baxter to uh was something that was actually a ... a listens to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no wonder Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a a little bit of a record that we've been talking about which is called women or Rhapsody [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh [noise]\nOh no\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nDefinitely interactivity which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by my ... now who also directed la la la land and read it too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I think I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man but la la land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and a three laws stops and starts and and uh and during that time I er I made with flash and then during and after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way also if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like these goals that I loved\nScript and I said oh yeah you like musicals love Gene Kelly and we talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land but as soon as I like it was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into that\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joy and the most anxiety and doing a movie like fresh man which there's so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like\nSound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like replicating real side and then miniatures it it's it's\nYou know la la land was a complex found but that's like the choreography in a camera work and that dreamy sequences and it's just like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I uh I think everything you described gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were are going to the end they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they went to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility but certainly I haven't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right in pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nDidn't you know thank you so much for attacking that's been great to have you back on our shown congratulations on thank you so nice to be back thanks for having the\nDamage has directed the
