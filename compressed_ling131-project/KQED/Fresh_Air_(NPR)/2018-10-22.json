I'm In journalism professor at NYU documentary filmmaker and uh we've asked you here to join us today because I feel like it's fair to see become mildly obsessed with the topic of today's show\nThat might be some truth to that um look I'm a journalism professor I think a lot about a worry a lot about fake news and more generally I'm really concerned about trust on the Internet\nAnd it came to us and said ah before there was fake news before there was a possibility of like fake video and fake audio the world was dealing with a different fake problem\nYes fake online reviews people have been posting this on as online fake reviews for years\nYeah and and this is becoming such a huge problem because like you know I go on line to\nBuy a hover board and I don't know if this had record has five stars because it is awesome and I'm On a cruise around town looking cool or if it's five stars because someone is making up those reviews and in fact when I take it home it's going to set my house on fire\n... is here with a glimmer of hope for us yeah\nAnd the glimmer of hope it's coming from it totally unexpected place the online body building community\nToday on the show the story of

and the onion and a a bottle of water\nWhoa that's high stakes dropping out of the Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand\nSix Tommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen and it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds\nMonday Tommy was hanging out with a friend\nBut he says hey you want the rest of this pretty workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those\nAnyway ... it's really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he's after Tommy\nPaid sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counter productive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things on line like supplement\nThe years of my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer they could just\nTell me sign up a teenager he could built an online review side but bodybuilder skipped honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into that bodies\nAll right so this one has a hundred and Seventy seven reviews for stars like that which is great on the surface\nAnd then you take the URL copy it and then you pasted into vehement okay and then I hit my report and events that report\nRight and they do computing computing bleep bleep bleep bleep whatever it's going to take a wild reading like a hundred and Seventy seven reviews would take me like five hours at any rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noone in on the line to walk us through a few of the things his website flags about these iPhone cable reviews\nOf him so so this product we feed that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average\nThese reviews of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average reviews they weigh more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue\nWith words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was up in this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise] uh\nYeah and and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the cord and to use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that way [laughter] well seven people also say\nThey performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is an ... [laughter]\nYeah so Tommy software random about a dozen different pets or iPhone cable reviews and his reports it out and it just it waiting\nA so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating under review Mehta is one\nThe reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating under the ... is one point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying ... only trust at six percent of the review and that trustworthy reviews say actually these cables that crap\nTommy has generally speaking cables like that are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews anything with like low\nManufacturing costs and high margins I'm like what yeah yeah I phoned cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills to stop\nWe of course reached out to Amazon and about this\nAnd they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they send us an extensive statements about it\n... itself admits that they do not have the\nCity that you could do this when I was like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even stay with high confidence whether a review it state according to\nWhat Amazon thing it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\n... that is a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are authentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake\nReviewers in other words the Amazon his thing there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSuch complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they found my product red\nLake it doesn't matter if it's a positive Ficre view if someone buys a product that's good for the site\nThat that that might come a time where they are too many fake it\nSure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up on the Internet shopping\nAnd we'll go back to front ... she'll [laughter]

several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing ... almost as much as we did with an old bone pet but\nDoing so in suburban St Louis and it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis bread company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in suburban marketplace while Obama was our urban stress\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis Freeh company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nTo you choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them and it was going to be [noise] St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing\n[noise] but we rename than concept [noise]\nAn air bread in all markets other than St Louis but we renamed it their bread because as we went to new markets people often thought from St Louis was more associated

because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and then\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak get into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and I said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen and they said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like ... look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I and then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter] was going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross how humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes so ... really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't\nIntended and it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for bathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through some\nDr ... and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a\nVulnerable humiliation that we can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMost McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise]\nIs um insults [laughter]\nInsulting no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know what are you not [laughter] but at the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and Paul riding Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd that that the other couple other Leslie manpower ... Koppel have threatened you so you're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that's that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do say All right you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra hour and our kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he when he said to me was he told me what language Catherine language for me to relate what they do not both said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake couple of big commercial that's what you look like\nLike your bank commercial capital none of this talk is productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you both in the yard with my bone scaring me this is what happens when you corner you corner me I Will ... drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just got back on and on with more over the top insults is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and stuff\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on a screen but\nYeah one of the first time I watched\nThat back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that\nAnd the person was sitting with us to sit for watching you say you set all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came up to the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nHow'd you improv insults before\n[noise] [noise] yes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very\nAssertive um characters that you know I think in the heat especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything just to kind of ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character yeah you're very aggressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guest is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on Netflix Wednesday\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nAnd here's a song from the soundtrack of can you ever forgive me sun by blossom during\nHis lungs and that\nIt's lovely going ooh\nIt's\nOn ... and\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring\nWhere employers can post jobs and do your screener questions to build their short list of preferred candidates learn more it indeed dot com slash higher and from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company\nFamily owned operated and argued over since Nineteen eighty proud supporter of independence\nThought whether that's on line over the air or in a bottle more it\nThought whether that's on line over the air or in a bottle more it Sierra Nevada dot com\n[noise]\n\n... comes from this station and from more than five\nHundred tire model from twenty to manufacturers and an online tool for finding tires based on vehicle mean budget and brand tire rock dot com or\nHelping drivers find delivered in stone [noise] I'm from T.

A.\nDot or this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nIt when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nHe's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your\nOff [laughter]\nAnd you're just like why\nIf your job off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting an actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler [noise] God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think some more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who even though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now\nHe actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh air and all the ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white man\nI Would have flash it at like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explode it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and be you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd ... other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I've seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I [noise]\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt\nTo make sure that you can act in material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to sink or decent too it's like the perfect closing they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all [laughter]\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were out at for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger mental behavior yet to two women so like I as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate than meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now\nEvery little inch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and\nThe fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength in numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or after a break John Powers will review a new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target\nIt drops on next next Wednesday this is fresh air\nIn the new ... new new ...
