Oh thank you so much Terry Gross\n[laughter] so did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents ah finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting because they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic\nAnd my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your families I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I get older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand and twelve that I share the story more widely\nHad come home from school\nAnd somebody wrongs me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go in their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in third\nGrade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you Kurds but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know\nUm they smoked two packs a day each nah older\nAnd my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like to put an inconvenience to the point where said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker revolves so heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding shower with that Sunday\nAnd the most leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife should be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her and oh gosh ... so they were so lucky the hosted in ...\nOh gosh that's dangerous as though they were so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents are different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother stopped is that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm Joe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front\nAh surely was also drinking to a lot then um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare\n[noise] this recurring dream I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force and these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but\nIf I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know\nWriting out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences but visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen did they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same schools and building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you think they'd often open up the bedroom door and find sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help the ... are you seeing someone who's talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me art was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in mice sketchbooks and and then my drawings\nWhen you took art classes and then you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes 'cause he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud that you tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was gonna get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally and in that moment uh and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style and ration develop fat he did that I said\nDid you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics flux Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics like that that was actually useful for you\nYou certainly are there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know ... that's the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the ...\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based

I Would worry I wake up in the middle of night thinking\nWhat if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long in Detroit process from really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was her it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd go to eat on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise] and and I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated but I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like lick you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home so [laughter] you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that she would worth address she wore to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house\nI Would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was for sponsor and I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex a semester and wouldn't be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks her shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom make my mum beautiful again but I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits and and all our for drug paraphernalia\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know what there's a there's a feeder closet and this other on the right of course I dress that was that important to her she would preserve and the feed her closet\nSo I ...

'cause ask are the best picture books and a graphic novels for young adults his new book is a graphic memoir is called hate you know how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction\nHis mother was a heroin addict he's grandparents took her legal custody of him when he was a turning three\nAnd this is the story of his childhood so what ... what are you afraid at some point do you have your children had any contact with them or\nYes and uh and we had a game plan set you know even with the children's school this is my mother Leslie Chris Oscar she turns up to not let the children leave with her\nAnd I must have really hurt to have to leave an instruction\nThat did it did and um you know there are moments where we had a game plan where if my mother was a turn up at our doorstep unannounced or my wife would take the children upstairs lock the door and I would call the police just to have on hand in case something bad happened\nYou know when when you're writing from the point of view as a child in your granted memoir heck you know you you can find your mother and said how are you chose drugs over me mhm how do you see it now as an adult\nAnd we all want agriculture to continue but on the other hand it's a huge user of water so we have to find a way to home more aware of what water or during the wet years for the dryers in this means\nWater storage it doesn't necessarily mean dams at gray water storage and a number of different\nPlaces and I think we can get some of that done with the money that is now available\nThank you smart with Dennis I just had one thing to do one thing in this whole debate with regards to waters fishing the Central Valley That's Kevin author ... apologized us one thing that's often overlooked in the whole debate in in ... and so find science correct you know I'm a whiskey drinking in in the waters for\nFighting and how polemic and polarizing the issues in especially in Central Valley with farmers growers developers and so forth but one thing is overlooked is in Central Valley we have many Flint\nMichigan's we have many Flint, Michigan we have people who have no access to clean water we have people who are drinking contaminated water but we don't\nEver speak about that those are not the strong political interests that are represented either in the state capital or in the nation's capital and we have to start looking at the humans\nWho worked there and live there who need to provide a decent living for their family members and that's just one issue because I Know Flint, Michigan has really kept debate of the nation but we have so many Flint, Michigan some Central Valley thank you\nSeek immediate them senator smoking we I north highlands\nWhat national security issue keeps you up at night\nShe says oh [laughter]\nThere are I guess no and national security issues um\nSee unpredictable that worries me it's the acute attacked by some group of people that leads to more\nUm I think that the world is a place that diplomatic solution rather than fighting\nBecome more and more apparent\nUm I think there's been progress made with North Korea for example\nAnd it's I'm On a personal basis between this president and ah that leader how it holds up I have no idea like North Korea\nBecause of its missile ... growing missile capability and it's near ability to put a nuclear warhead on these missiles is if they could hit our country or is obviously a country of great worry for many of us\nAnd so we welcome a the interaction um I think\nAn unexpected attack a\nIs not likely however\nI think that there are many point difference I mean what's just happened in the middle east with killing a Jamal ... uh I in of all places\nIt counseling which shouldn't be safe I mean countries use their ... their embassies and consulates provide safety to people you don't go into a counselor and get killed by staff and counseling\nSo this is in my view a major happening and there has to be a full investigation\nWe have to find out what happened we have to find out whether Mr ... learn there apparently he was not based on information when he said about what happened once he got in that counseling um\nIs is really I think\nA test case ah for some action that should be taken and um I Hope the investigation is international I Hope it's west and I hope it comes to some conclusion as to exactly what happened in that case\nCenter there and they and what are you seeing as big as a threat to national security today well I I think that when you vote for war\nWe're talking about American lives we're talking about the lives of others were talking about the American taxpayer dollars and we have mothers and fathers today will not ever again see their children we have sons and daughters who will never\nEver see their mothers and fathers again we have been in Afghanistan for Seventeen years now new rock we had been there for Fifteen Years now those are longer than the Vietnam wars\nHave spent more than six\nTrillion dollars of American taxpayer dollars should have been spent on health care and debt free college education and investments on clean energy\nUse her series the boats\nAnd as a result this region this area is not more stable it's unstable even more so it's not more safe it's less safe and our security as a nation is much more peril there'll be might as well but one thing ISIS never existed\nUntil the invasion and occupation of Iraq\nAnd when we made the decision when George W. Bush made the decision\nAlong with Donald Donald Rumsfeld and along with Dick Cheney\nAlong with our senior centers votes to go into Iraq this is a mess that we have been left with and it's been the disenfranchisement of almost an entire generation of Americans these are issues that we should not take lightly\nThis war out of fairness didn't just start with Donald Trump it started with bronco bummer when he was president with our military presence\nA and indirectly a in a Yemen so this is what keeps me up at night because those regions now or less stable never before these are votes that give the president of the United states and the executive branch the legal authority\nTo move forward with bombing other nations we need to get out of business a bombing other nations we got to get out of the business of nation building I Do subscribe to what Joe Biden says oh which we should develop a strike team that enters countries where there's ... terrorists are being harbored\nSo we can remove them or eliminate them all together but you don't go and bomb a whole country in the bay the whole country and occupy a whole country to deal with the issue of terrorism thank you um [noise] we only have about ten minutes or so and go on line I rely on you know\nI don't want a camera no camera All right so I I like I hear from both of you where do you think\nDemocrats stand for in Congress today in Congress or different internal in Congress and what's your position on impeachment that was one of the questions from the audience actually one of my question now\n\nBecause of lack of action in Washington\nDC California is to lead on the issue of the environment on the issue of climate change on the issue of protecting our immigrant families on the issue of raising the minimum wage the highest in the nation Fifteen dollars an hour\nOn the issue of health care on the issue of sexual harassment and yes means yes and dealing with sexual assaults of young college a women on a university campuses up and down the state of California because we have\nFolks in Washington DC that have locked the courage of their convictions to do the right thing by every day folks I Wish Democrats in Washington would fight like hell for dreamers just the way Donald J Trump and the Republicans fight\nLike hell for their stupid wall I Wish I could see that in the Washington DC that lack of courage always backpedaling every single time is not the type of leadership that we need today in the country and especially for the most innovative most beautiful mosaic of ethnicity from all of his country and\nFrom all over the world which is the great state of California that's why we need new leadership that's on the front\nLines and not on the sidelines that's going to elevate disease even if we're mathematically in the minority\nTo elevate these issues at a national level people agree or disagree with Elizabeth Warren I haven't made my opinions you know she's the one that without seniority has elevated the issues that she cares deeply about what the folks agree with her\nOr disagree with it altogether and that's why I think that Washington has the status quo is simply not working for everyday Californians because although we are the fifth\nLargest economy in the world and I've said that this ... it's a point of of of of a price for us to be the fifth largest economy in the world but at the same time we have so many millions of Californians who had been left behind\nHow many here are a paycheck or two I Know there's a lot of us\nFrom either living at home with a family with their friends are worst living in a car or on the streets and that is applied of so many Californians in so many Americans so the issue of impeachment I've always said from day one\nThat I Would move forward with impeachment I don't believe in peach which shouldn't be politicized\nPerhaps a Washington DC it's talking points the D triple C and so forth to me it's not a political issue that you weaponize to me the issue is the legal standard does this president meets the legal standard for\nHappened they they tricked me um and so that transition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in and one thing we've really found is that\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere\nDark a melancholy and even tragic places and that maybe in a live action show some of the story beats would feel modeling or saccharin or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and it's bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some fun surprising ways\nI liked it sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] defined as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version [laughter] and and oh jak\nIsn't such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closer says eyes and nearly guys off the road then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's so lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt of the closet deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he's willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote if I'm an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really that dimension and low tech does not feel warmly toward her now this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium Adam like her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was named to his mother and they were both named Jack [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is well or not as low jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horse around seriously though hold your applause\nWill held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a new maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted to have something to learn for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be living his life again it of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya or they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted anyway that we're supposed to water to be careful\nMoms of the way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Bolivia decides to go with her the network really juiced\nBecause there is a Libya gone for good but of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother\nBecause it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rise from Mr T. alpha ... stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show you shouldn't have happy ending ... not really because\nIf everyone's happy to show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than [noise] you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that\nI'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip that um he indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to um let me do you think about that well\nYou know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship\nWith his parents is about this idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nAnd I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of you know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deemed liberal or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurt so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least some really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement were sent so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter] I'm One of the funny things that you've come up with\nFor the the richer you un the writers is we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the freebies that we\nWatch nor the we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards\nThat celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how the additives that our industry so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things\nAnd the rate was kind of like swing back into the limelight\nAnd we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding men accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new\nUm so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers and I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her\nIs use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know really CK a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ...

us my guest is Rafi out by Blacksburg and he's the executive producer creator and show runner of the Netflix animated\nComedy tragedy he's\nA bow jak horsemen which is now being shown on reruns on Comedy Central ... watching the series especially like after the eulogy episode\nI would've thought that you were a bitter man who had a very troubled childhood reading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell\nParents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore or your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell me about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother on to a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area and so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit and the kids\nIs that we're chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah distance happy Halloween because it's missing an end to the misfit toys and um it it's just so very normal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated [laughter] now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and\nIt's really been a wakeup call in the last few years\nTo feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAre you now officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years they'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out that I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where\nIf there is something that really interested me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it's like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants\nInappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time\nI didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here watching the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shout out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's\nA ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a tension has been a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least\nI'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference to me you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is TV like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references\nIn jak horsemen and some of them like just like ... by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them said made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when he was growing up\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nThey space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like\nJust like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them um set made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you're growing up\nYeah we'll see if he made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a\nA real lesson that I had to learn um and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think if the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all of a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know or wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free and this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting another story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running bow jak witches and that's the next year is now the comedy central as rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you test you in retrospect for like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making sure there are the right time for Comedy Central\nAnd you know we're obviously want them to keep their dignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
