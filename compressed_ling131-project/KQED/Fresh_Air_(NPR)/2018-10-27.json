I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never for giving them for that [noise] but\nSense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never for giving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran or I ... yeah\nYou know and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap and she was saying a guide you ever want to spend money are living in these all of these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nThat I just said what would your father ever given their money and she said of course he was giving them money you know if it's anything from the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexity flu dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really just like amazed me a reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his arm he didn't have any money not eat said he got a job working for his father hyping\nUp in his father's accounting office yes extending transgression is that [laughter] I Try to let you know he's\n... and he always be with hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time and make money and if they were already ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm that but that the NYPD Blue quit the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car driving back to Long Island I mean I could never get confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship it was a [noise]\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt that he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names that was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of yeah the kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what work and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for them to read\nWell that's yeah that's very interesting question because you know um [noise] yeah ... ... a a Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular and you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know and says like we should have a bad year rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know and you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for ...\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio decided that the the velvet underground what kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be singer\nToo young to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of visibility\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with that he's limited Nico sports it's fishing as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band and as soon as he could he got ... you know he kicked Nico has the band as well\nAfter having an affair with her\nAnd well that's very true [laughter] exactly every you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol\nA Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time were who was in the newspapers all the time you know not\n... you know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like all this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd ah you know Lou took advantage of that\nBut that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back that was a pretty Ernest thing and the Warhol seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who have been heard them yet you know in her novel amazing there so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I have you know this needs to be more professional operation and you know there's no way Andy Warhol was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nGuess is Anthony declared is the author of the books we read a life it's just been

underground broke up a transformer which produced by David Bowie and you know always of course famous for all of his you know persona and for his sexual fluidity what impact did working with David Bowie have on the lead in terms of\nHis self image and his persona\nWell you know Lou how complicated feelings about that um you know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David belly was kind of a you know the coming thing and uh you know Boeing you [laughter]\nYou know has flu like there was a very conventional aspect of the way I mean much as he was a boundary breaker\nHe always you know kind of respected his older you know and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list and so she you know but we offered to produce transformer and restored you know lose standing\nAfter the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit 'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record\n'em you know so little of course you know once you got to hit that he desperately wanted your kind of came to resented and you know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player mc ... who co produced out album with ah with with David\nUh they created that song and also you know ... other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are that are on that record and uh you know made it such a\nYou know such a significant album for Lou\n... walk on the ... from that album and\nUm this was his only real like radio hit and it was a big hand I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about [noise]\n\nSolid came from Miami ...\nHitchhiked way across the usa [noise] clubs or ... rounds on the way to shave

walk on the wild sign his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually a head friendly lead but if I can tell from your book like he was a cat he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band to have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more government that is yeah\nYeah precisely and even if you did have heads [laughter] you know you got a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA a but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the wall side again and\nThat kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nAh you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I'd lived but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record 'em [noise]\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed his dad you know because the next thing was\nAnd roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise] um yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that would unsinkable before Lou did it\nAnd I'm just I I never wanted he wanted to have it needs to reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream an outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by extending the firm Comcast extend it Internet delivers in home why for all of
