I could they spent his summers as a kid working on his grandparents dairy farm in Wisconsin\nAndy is still in the dairy world he is now a dairy economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably or you know close to a hundred percent are able to Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have before school started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rats and Andy had a ringside seats to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away it was\nNineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started flooding this idea\nOf them have bomb a profit\nBut I haven't given bombers I weigh\nOne of the wave Carter proposed giving farmers an equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nYeah it certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nSo a campaign promise that's what we call those yeah there you go\nThis was not just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own food 'cause if our farmers to go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for ensued then that is a kind of national security risk\nIt's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new does it it's one thing to provide stability is another step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls is playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk is going up more than six cents a gallon SUV is going up because the government is\nAnd you you hear of it and he likes back your forehead oh boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that it would get as bad as a guy but every instinct I had said ooh this is ... workouts\nHello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show the story of what happened when the president of the United states decided he was going to help America's farmers by buying milk lots\nOf them is a case study in what happens when price controls runs both feet into the realities of the market\nThere will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river\nAnd the touching exchange between Martha Stewart\nInstead of dogs do you mean by governments she don't buy you got to be on a special mammoth\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Charles Schwab who believes the modern approach to wealth management starts with asking questions and providing straightforward answers Charles Schwab\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much but the problem\nAndy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound\nBlock than five hundred pound barrel\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose which one you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps to keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like bricks\nAnd this is what people will remember as government cheese because when the government starts to get away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great change give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus this footage is amazing just massive\nCrowds of people being handed bricks that or she is and it comes with the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard some black USDA stamps on it and he's a state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt is this moment that government she truly enters the Americans lead stream as we unloaded the cave full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food bank and schools military match calls\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became [noise] back\nMany listeners may remember Saturday Night live matched fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nI'm here to any government cheese and\nGovernment she starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture\nA short story by Junot Diaz clear the government chief from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of\nSongs that we bought we would like to do something and she\nMay be government she's the most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart that's with me\nOf the government she\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair it was processed cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember\nGovernment handout and to be fair was process cheese kind of like a BRCA Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than ... I hate that you know Belviq is okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to ban but I'm not running around valve either but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat board trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Johnny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nParents doing the dance Cary doing the dance strain but here is way government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter died on the stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nBut I haven't given bombers I ain't no way\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough well\nI think there's there's two basic lessons\nAgain economist Andy ... which\nOne is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson as you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because we can come back and bite you and by jarred\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese [laughter] than I mean\nThat was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented very very expensive she's been big\nGovernment cheese cave started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nThe thing about price controls is that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we can this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of snow one part of the solutions and was to gently get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk\nLike hate people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk\nWe took a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... years old and we created the national dairy board but this is what gave us a you know the got milk and the milk mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension for these days if the government wants to help farmers don't generally hear about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the the government has tended to stay away\nFrom buying cheese a solution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the aid of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies that Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again\nAnd then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distribute it to places like schools and food banks that'd be fair that's probably not enough to start filling caves with skin but\nThere is a chance that the government maybe in the business of

sons are already written in recorded by the time you were born Suzanne selling Marion here that's no way to say goodbye burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so\nDid you hear him or he did he didn't need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and sing is but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what is the son and his singing at ... um\nBut but you are you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing my craft that's something people actually did and you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I was a five year olds are on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign land into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\nAnd you grow older and then you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record of the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said man you've scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton\nThat he had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated\nUm five six the don't remember how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... who has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some uh was remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims and uh my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained the role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\nCaravan has like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah they are like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nOkay yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived uh and it was a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he\nPut it that the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so ah [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his caravan\nHow's that for\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate ... which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and\nThen it in its own way as may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for um he's reconnection to people I'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like steam so we'll just sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nHe often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible [laughter] that with the canon of his work\nAll the [laughter] the with the candidate of his work with his devotion to black eating pages melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time up since ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I Wanna say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even a whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand tickets so thank goodness for that economic crisis\n[noise] so you get the song writes back she has no it's really\nYeah this is\nMy guest is songwriter singer Adam Cohen who is the Senate Leonard calling Adam wrote the forward to a new
