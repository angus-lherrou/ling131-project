interviewed him about an exhibition at New York's new museum of contemporary art\nIt was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the

repay place but it's many sequels to it it opens up Indian summer is like a woman for a [laughter]\nBut grace Mattel is you know how does that famous authors out of her and the lumberjack or a dirty ponytail sitting at the typewriter and I was obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book but painting plays itself on the book came out I remember the ad campaign is how did they make a movie out of Peyton place or something like that\nBut whenever they go to a sexual scene they would cut short cut away shot of symbolism like ...\nLike if someone was frigid they'd have a frozen lake where somebody was getting turned off and they'd show up blossom and brain so it was all Corning nature shop and it looks like bad National Geographic shots but actually it's dirty shots of what they couldn't show them\nI my parents bought me a reel to reel tape recorder so I could tape songs I was the first download her ever because I was a real real tape recorder tape songs off the radio but then so I could sing them on lip sync from basically so I always I was a puppeteer as a kid I I\nHad a job I had a career when I was twelve years old so puppeteer so I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged even though the work I was doing was not exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it was this or nothing maybe or prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she just had her entire faced tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you guys\n[noise]

plan up to the hilt and and be you know take on opposed of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took on\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made the movies because I didn't have any advertising no one knew what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that for those as as a [laughter]\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three when hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outside a group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes and in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy\nI'd love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy is how she pronounces it [noise] um so I I was in ...\nKennedy's how she pronounces it [noise] um so I I was in I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line and we'll Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people but kidnap models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's a scene where divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone 'cause we were trying to\nEven the fans I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines but there were many off at the time [noise]\nPham magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing or a capital case I mean a pitiful version but we have the show for our we have 'em all the people that when the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divided waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' St Louis in Maryland I'm Marcia avenue\nAnd a and a man it is score to our classical music where there was one note that as the gun shot and then divine crawls I turned on the car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed\nSo primitive lady that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the ... the one of the most famous eight millimeter movies ever\nSo um I I I did a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a ... well I Believe in the art world but the frame is the hype the frame as the advertising campaign\nSo to me it was too big for one wall and it has to go around the wall\n[laughter] I'm In ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine who in this film that you're referring to like Jackie Kennedy design was you know it's very heavy man who who usually played a woman Indian movies and had hung himself in some of those roles on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWhether they were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens a lot hip or are they all want it to be best my ears\nAnd [laughter]\nUm so it was they were really square they worship ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see him that way stock and they're all really sunny and have a sense of humor and they have funny names and everything but but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest\nIn Philadelphia a I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous\nA drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunding and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen as as being um comedy terrorist which I I think it was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that you work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business\n[laughter] somebody said that was\nThe ... thing I ever said I didn't mean to be some money back to leave that most everybody secretly imagines himself in show business and every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are sad during a famous of America [laughter]\nI guess you really needed to be famous\n[laughter] um well I I I certainly can't complain about it I hate to hear people that are in show business to complain about any of that kind of thing what what on earth did you pick that field to go in for if you didn't want people to\nRecognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people involved that that we base of life on having to get approval of strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\nYou know in your book there are lots of skills of movies and I'm not just skills from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter]\nYou also have failed or ... yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of cloud dolls that clients in howdy Doody not no

a waterfall and I thought to myself like a nice for you to get because now you're going to have relatively drown in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely soaked but also get the get the log across the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this law get get across the river\nAnd I'm looking over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand in the form of um the rock and he was terrified and there's rocking us laws [noise]\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me his rifle\nAnd I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turn around and I very intently gave it to John and I said sure John do you mind\nHolding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed Abdul hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among\nThe shoulder and they're like ... like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and up to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they heard goes and they pray and then my business\nBut there's this guy in their country that's been charged with a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion and\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nHe explained that John but we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss would get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but\nJason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living with skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned that John Day you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and\nI'm from my prayers were opposed to that sort of course of action\nSort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself were pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we\nBut Jason would\nTalk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up a rock bashing the schools\nAre stabbed their next with Dick damage out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and ... and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy had to fight his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that God might be better than a sticker Rob and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain and one of the characters are ... and now with only two characters with guns to for climbers ... locked from home night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and you start imagining exactly what you're going to need when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies\nAnd then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken after time it was when we take guesses and it turns out that had been five minutes and I think that's probably went Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering all the time that day it just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they can navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said to here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain among with only one of his men as guard and not one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of weird way we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together it's somewhere there was safe and and obviously man that he had fought in the story that I found a week's selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him to know [noise]\nAnd I served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was has Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out the he has this look like he's I Know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than\nThey split up do tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere was just a ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and you heard of it was like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids as I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate think basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night\nAnd so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that they would game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh I'm\nTrying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with them and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we can do and believe morally and killing somebody but at the point where like this is this is our chances of survival\nTommy to kind of came flying over the top of me and wet racing up to class and it just sort of scrambled\nUp over behind him and she wasn't expecting\nIt at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab it's gotten strep sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strap and I pulled his heart and I could and he just toppled over backwards\nJust kind of wanting to spark through them in like an eternity looked at me\nWe just don't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is a chance to survive\nTommy to kind of came flying over the top of the main thing and when raped and got the class\nAnd it just sort of scrambled up over behind him\nAnd she wasn't expecting it at all and but as I was reaching out to grab it God's job sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I pulled harder than I could and he just toppled over backwards\nThe bone fusion as Anton ... support me after the second operation have made me if I carrying this man I'm not manifest in my personality I'm\nI always knew that he had medical issues and then obviously the brand surgeries and that was really traumatic for me I think I was [noise] fourteen\nFifteen some like that and this is huge British engineer and while Stewart is this great all depends you know like everyone in his family to me all hearts and free spirit he loves being outdoors and this is the way he talks about mountain biking\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to like work ahead cranks revolving just felt like one two one two something like that you gotta you know you had that sense of joy and you're just like wind down there\nAnd and you would always happy and healthy\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old since you started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed and now formation in his brain\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain now from Asians which crazy Spencer\nEven bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision\nAlone or you know I'm without his end but\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd I'm the only one you can have strongly did you feel this way I Would say that I say it was about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared\nOr just knocked threat coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of [noise]\nA different person center was scare his personality which which is a phenomenon in brain surgery\n[noise] sometimes people experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new TV genre and stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\n[noise] so I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything wasn't on better from it\nMade him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure\nEven help you know\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regret about my own stern dreams because I still have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime\nMinute to him that [noise] one of my biggest regrets surgeries and my surgeries and it's made me a\nSomewhat better person at times um\nSo and I get a little skeptical to go with you there's like ... okay I'm In like ... story with Amy and binge kid\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that's the term entire brain or something like physical no wonder you're my\nProblem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from set a goal to their we spend to having a severe headache again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent you was just talking about are you a British and shortly after we arrived she began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bed holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restarted ivy\nAnd there for a few minutes as I watched and try to catch his breath I I I thought we would lose them\nIn was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles ... dispatchers hospital room\nIn the u._s. you [noise] to see them in a coma in\nA condition than I hoped only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union\n\n\n\nThan\nGoing to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should ever have to make\nSnap judgment the override episode continues

episode when it was in Washington\nAnd we left off young man Spencer you lay unconscious some hospital because of a Mel formation in his brain it's all of his family knew was that no matter what she never ever wanted to have brain surgery\nYou've been through and had to strip and while he lay in the hospital bed today did\nHis family his mom and dad Steven as British do had to decide what to do it simply they had to decide whether or not to operate they're surgeons name with Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now there was a one to five percent chance center would have another ...\nAnd that chance would increase every year the light\nBut the surgery he was proposing was very risky when Dr King would explaining these very daunting odds any recording it you could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nSome risk associated with it is about five to ... percent chance of a major complications from surgery or a minor mon or anything in between um\nI Know that the surgery before this out [noise]\nI think that the the situation is\nDramatic change and knowing that we know now with all that you know what you want\nTo do and I think that the physician I'm putting you guys been is to make that determination nobody in the world knows him better than three\nUm so it's not what you want\nOr what I Want to rent or with mom or dad now\nWhat would you want and that's where we're\nAt have you ever performed another surgery with a difficulty but I could I'd heard of the brain natural yes okay for him at the cabinet maker at your desk project that sort of
