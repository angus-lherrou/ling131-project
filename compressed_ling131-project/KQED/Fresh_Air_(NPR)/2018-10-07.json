[noise]\n\nYou know Kevin choice or as a regular guest on the daily and when he's not against somebody which feels like a lot\nUm you are a columnist at the time as you were a writer at large at the New York times magazine and I how do you describe your ...\nAh I cover like the worst people on the Internet\nI don't know I I feel like I'm you know unlike dirty jobs when they have those guys who like put on wet suits and dive down into the tanks of sewage unplug the sewers [laughter] I got to me but like on a computer [laughter]\nUm [laughter] but on the computer um and\nThe funny thing about you people don't know is it before you were even a calmness before even gotten the times you wrote to love and the first of those books having a pretty wild premise and I want to remind people about what that was\nYes so when I was in college I uh didn't sign up for a study abroad program instead I went um undercover at Jerry Falwell Liberty University\nAny uh and the other one does a liberty alumni out there\nThat I didn't I didn't think so um [noise]\nAh anyway so I Know you're not even jealous no no no no I I grew\nUp in a sort of very liberal Quaker\nHouse and I'm not the oatmeal not the oatmeal we get a lot of that you're you're uh you're on to say they're cute or um [noise] but I I Wonder experience life on the other side and see this was\nDuring sort of the tail end of the Bush years\nUm that George W. Bush and I wanted to kind of see what the religious right was doing and now obviously liberty is like\nYou know Trump gave the commencement address there last year it's become sort of a big Republican uh operative machine um but back then it was still run by the senior Jerry Falwell and who's since died and it was\nIt was a bizarre and and sort of wild experience of being not only like going to classes there but living in the dorms and singing and the church choir and things like that\nAnd how undercover where you people know that you were writing a book\nNo no I I transferred there as if I was like you know just a student and I I I went to to brown which is sort of like the opposite of of\nIf you focus on like\nFrom from from brown to liberty yeah it ... it was like um when we actually they had a very funny reaction to the liberty 'cause like I Would say they would say where did you come\nFrom and I would say I would say you know I went to brown and the and they said look I'm so sorry [laughter]\nLike I'm so sorry\n[laughter] it must be awful there how do you how did you do that they assumed I was like an evangelical\nTrapped um [laughter] so we had fun in a liberal you want you to college with ... yeah um then you've got around to I did ... [noise]\nI'm In San Francisco to Ivy League schools are listed applause [laughter]\nYes yes [laughter] um [laughter]\nI don't feel it's it's ... it starts to feel the me going back and looking at your resume that at the idea of ...\nOf of putting yourself in a sort of ... to you at least an exotic world and just kind of bearing herself and it is you're calling card and the most recent version of that as as listeners the daily now has been immersing yourself profoundly in leaving the darkest corners of the weather I mean\nAs you said you're a beat is kind of prefer perversion of of the Internet\nYou know I'm I'm interested in extremes I'm interested in people who choose to live very differently than I Do and um and part of what we've seen happen over the past several years is that the Internet and social media has has really given voice to extremist and I'm I'm very interested in how that happens\nAnd what kinds of things that used to do and where they congregate so I'm I have you know every day I wake up and I turned on my computer and I I have like a whole running list of like awful for Jim a sub or than reading threads that I check and then I you know check my email [laughter]\nAfter you take us back is I\nMean I Wish that people why we put together this particular cast of characters on stage and it's because we're very much want to do explained the essential elements of what it is to make a daily and so here on stage tonight you have the like three a tab atomic elements of the show you have your dashing host may [noise]\nUm you have [noise]\nYou have your your your intrepid undercover reporter and you have your own brilliance behind the scenes producer any brown [noise]\n\nAnd and and forget that we're going to draw back the curtain on on of course the tech industry but also how ... how we make the daily and the reality is that when you drop back the curtain on the daily\nIt's not always so perfect and highly produced or even pretty and I say that because you may all ... remember that if you listen to the first couple of weeks with the show I don't come from the world of audio I don't I have no experience in the world of audio\nI mean in reality I Do not deserve to be an audio host I did not come from this world I Am not want to do\nAnd um and when the show started I encountered a tremendous my difficulty actually just doing the work of of being an audio host my voice was much higher than it is now we can talk about how that changed um [noise]\nAnd I do read audio rip your best and yeah that's what I call it um and and I\nGenuinely struggle with just the basics of like saying we'll be called the billboard of the top of the show from the New York times and today and that and all that stuff and and I could not do it and we would be in the studio for hours yeah trying to make it work [noise]\nIt's ... it's yeah it's just so normal I didn't think that would be a joke that but [laughter] there's a there's kind of a story that became kind of like took on mythic quality is on the team whenever someone would joined the team with the Taliban of the night before the daily launched and all the producers were packed in the studio with Michael and we spent\nAn hour trying to get him to say the gate with enough ... that it could\nCould you could launch the daily and it would feel like we were taking on this moment with enough ... and we and we spent an hour just each producer at trying their hand at at coaching hand like I don't want to do so well worth slower land this way and we we actually have the last Fifteen seconds of this of this hour for you thank\nWould say like oh God those guys are so embarrassing like they're these boomers with their hoods and their robes and they're just like so cringe worthy [noise]\n\nSo they were sort of advocating for just a more so I I'm trying to figure out what role does does this word\nPlay in the actual unite the Right rally and ultimately I guess the violence for it I mean how directly do you feel like a site like this conversation is like those that you're listening to and we just heard and a contributing to what happens there wasn't\nAny space where people are able to gather in sort of semi private or private areas is is going to be prone to this I mean this is not I don't think this is this court's falls\nUm but I think after the after our story ran after the the ... Cav came out they did to crack down on these guys and and ban a lot of the biggest for clusters of extremists from their server since then you know it's more popped up but they're keeping a close ally that now and you ended up interviewing\nPeople in this group in this disorder but\nYeah I I called up a couple of the members and and one in particular was sort of one of the leaders of this group is one of the organizers of the rally and he's a big Internet I'm All right presence and um yeah we had a very interesting conversation\nI Want to play this clip of you're talking to the white nationalist because I think it does something really important in explaining why we created the daily and why the show is what it is which is\nIt creates a real transparency around reporting and storytelling and one of the things we don't talk about on the show is kind of how much the show is guided by what happened in the presidential election and the feeling that a lot of us had enough you know I definitely had that journalism and kind of failed\nUs in twenty sixteen and then we had arrived at a point where readers justify Li like didn't understand how we were getting our information and so little misled about the conclusions that that they have drawn because of the reporting we did\nAnd and the daily all about reading listeners really understand how journalism half\nWhat it's like to be on the phone with somebody what it's like when Dianne Feinstein answers the phone or in this case a white nationalist interrogate you and and I want to play that because I think it helps people understand what journals and actually sounds like\nOh you want to ask you a question you sort of stopped and said well can I ask you questions or for that person will\n[noise] what race are you a ...\nYou've seen my profile if you look Hispanic and I'm not as a you're white and Jewish was the question\nWell if you're white than a than a few years it'll be part of that group [laughter] okay All right [laughter] how good that I mean he\nBasically trying to beat you into saying something ... and\nThis is like the kind of story that would never that that would never make it into a print version probably but that we would I Would tell so you know my colleagues at the bar or that would come up in conversation I I Love that about\nIt's sort of what the reporter's notebook element of the day and that's what's so fun as we get to write a story for the paper and then bring all of the kind of extra material in and make it you know come alive in audio\nAnd we only have this clip because he was actually recording you so I think it's important to understand that it wasn't like you were recordings conversations necessarily fear it I think you were doing some kind of fact checking with him in this conversation he records that and then she uploads it\nWith him in this conversation he records that and then she uploads it on to you too as a kind of like gotcha moment and this is sort of crazy to me that like you are in in your regular reporting life\nAre find yourself in these kinds of there'll be traps where your sources are trying to catch you or or like corner you so that you say something that could potentially be banning for your career\nYeah and I always have to be on the lookout for that I mean are there are a lot of people with strong feelings about the New York times positively or negatively and we've we've learned that you know there are people who will try to plant false stories who will try to trick us we'll try to catch us doing something um so it's just it just makes you more cautious as a reporter I think\nI Wonder how much time you spend thinking about the dangers of amplifying this kind of journalism I mean you spend your day in this world\nAnd then you write about it and then you come on a daily and we're all collectively putting a lot of energy and time and print and audio into essentially given these people may be a bigger platform and I wonder how you grab all that\nYeah it's something that I think about a lot and I obviously you know we don't want to be a megaphone for people with extreme or sort of dangerous views on the other hand I'm\nAs with this court like a lot of times are reporting on this is the thing that brings the existence of these communities into people's awareness\nAnd in some cases actually leave the platforms themselves to kind of crack down on them so even though we may be amplifying like one specific set of people it can lead to you know major overhaul and changes at these platforms\nWhich can them sort of like it'd be a net good more the quality of the conversation on but I also think like that kind of I when I get this question a lot like how can you amplify\nThings like Q A non or um things that might remain on the fringes\nAnd I guess my answer is that these people have platforms I mean there there are people like Alex Jones and others\nHave enormous Internet platforms they they sort of um you know sometimes they're bigger than ours and so I think in that case we can sort of surveys like a translator or a corrective interest explaining to people sort of what's happening who's involved and what um what's the nature of the conversation is that how\nHow much did a sites like Facebook Twitter you to\nHow much of a rule that they play and taking what you are experiencing underscored and letting it run at all free on their websites\nWell this is sort of like how\nMuch information in and hate speech and sort of extremist content moved through the Internet there's like sort of a well established\nPath for those who like you know this quarter for channel that goes to read it and it goes to Twitter and then it goes to Facebook and YouTube\nUm so that's pretty familiar I think that ... ... right now with some of these companies are grappling with this kind of like how do we interrupt that chain or like how do we make it so that the stuff doesn't get millions of eyeballs on it but it's hard right like these people are crafting if you shut them down one place they moved to another place\nI'm with a different name so a lot of the servers that that got deleted from discord after Charlottesville are now back up with with other names\nUm and if your platform it's kind of like a whack a mole game it's it's pretty much sort of it's hard to win where are these guys now\nUm they some of them are are still underscored they've also moved into um groups on what's that they've moved in to um they moved on to read it they're they're sort of spread out a little more than they used to be outside of centralized where you have you know five thousand people in one group but they have sort of smaller\nPockets of that and one of the things you've done so well on a daily is explain how much accountability or non accountability\nHas occurred when it comes to the big social media companies that have been number comes from both burden by this and in some people's minds complicit in its amplification so\nYou have kind of made a sub beat it and your job of explaining to the world what\nFacebook especially have been doing when it comes to this and\nMy favorite episodes of the daily and I never expected them to be even listen I'm all\nFor the congressional hearings evolving or something\nYeah those are fun to watch that I don't even watch all five hours of it but you know people don't\nWatch congressional hearings like I was like I I'm not a I was not a news though for the daily and you I wouldn't have dreamed of wanting to watch a congressional hearing and I think one of the things that is so powerful that like you as a as a narrator on the daily is that\nYou can make it fun in a way that like I'm sort of I I can be like it'd be tricked into watch into watching a congressional hearing and and and and this hearing to the other context as if you remember what happened with say forget was going to be that\nThis moment where we're going to have\nA we were going to have Congress really holding Facebook accountable for what happened\nWell it's sort of what happened in the election and in Cambridge Analytica but the but this moment where they they could really they could ask Mark Zuckerberg anything and it was going to end like we're all sort of waiting to see what it would be and you as a narrator was so fun 'cause we saw\nOh just like your hair and therefore you consider my personal you're doing a ... day though the company to not mind is that if [noise]\nNo senator actually that's the first line of our terms of service say that you control and own the information and content that you put on Facebook\nIt sounds a little like a five hour tech support call [laughter]\nIt sounds a little like a five hour tech support call [laughter]\nIt's like trying to explain to someone very patiently how their iPhone weren't [laughter]\nHow do you how do you feel about this and they were like look you know there was a market we found a market um and people want what they want and we're just gonna keep giving it to them it has been a little bit harder for them recently because I'm Facebook has made some changes that I think are are really smart to sort of dial\nTo turn the dial on on sort of that kind of viral concept actually having a little bit harder time these days and getting the kind of audience that they once had and they're starting to experiment with other types of stories\nAnd because of the outrage machine doesn't work as quite as well as it used to\nAnd I'm Kevin this has been a very serious discussion it's been kind of having most daily discussions are kind of heavy Fannie and I think before we even think about\nTurning to our saviors and the audience for you and I we want to kind of light and things up just a touch that\nOne of the things about making a new show with a new house to hasn't been an audio is that you learn their verbal tank and as I'm sure you are now Michael by by has a pretty recognizable verbal attack\n... [noise]\nIt comes in many forms it's a it's quite polarizing people feel many different ways about it\nIf you guys get like a lot of emails about the ... yeah [noise]\nWe do we get at least one or two a week yeah that's a ... I have a pretty\nI have a somewhat of noxious reply to the people who don't like it would you like type ... H M\nM M M M M M [noise]\nNot just at the producer that using that email every time I did it feels like you're saying the same joke over and over again I think you should sell it\nThat email every time because it feels like you're saying the same joke over and over again\nOr if I should you should do as a ring tone though like you know [laughter]\nSo what's interesting about it and it's like oh you are to deal with and why this weird take I have I mean we'll talk about why I actually do right\nWhich is um when you're a journalist and you're on the phone with somebody and they're they're just sort of drawing on and on or saying wonderful things there aren't that many ways of affirming them or making them think you're still listening\nYou could do a lot of things without agreeing with things you can do the dishes you can do I mean you can go off and do a lot of things it's it's really more about ... ... you've been talking with your mother\n... [laughter]\nReally or about the fact that it's about it's about the fact that\nYou can be talking to someone that you don't agree with you and they can be saying something that you don't want to affirm but you want to say I hear you\nAnd you want the audience to know that you're still there and the and I think a lot of say right yeah yeah and when we talk to people but saying that sounds like you're actually two white nationalist do I sound like you're affirming them I like I feel\nVery firm personally when I go on that when I go to the daily I mean it's like a better now are the guys you making children of our just an hour yeah and and and I get a lot of affirming ... and I feel like I honestly I should be like paying your co pay for the [laughter] forget experience I I Hope everyone in this room someday has a chance to be affirmed by these guys [noise]\nOver ... there was something that any brown you may have yet waiting for them yes and we're wondering if it's anyone's birthday tonight there were those\nYesterday that's pretty good okay this one for you we have a birthday [noise]\n\n\n[noise] if if there is an explanation it was my birthday it was every day and anti brown made\nWell I also didn't have to change any of the patches of the [noise]\nYou just in the right pitches it's I just took one interview and took all the ... or give\nThat went on\nTo the ...\nIn the in the Dropbox there's just like a folder and now they're et cetera now there is but I I loved\nOnes are like ...\nAnd I'm not no way we're going to turn to you and I we are and before we do that\nI Want to thank you both coming all the way out here to be truly think\n[noise] sort\nOf come to life and the question Hi um this kind of\nWorks well with the last question I was wondering when you described a slow news day what if a lot is happening in the world and I love how you do the ending where you're like here's where else what else happens today how do you prioritize what story you tell on any given day\nSo in the morning so a number of the team goes to the nine thirty which is also called the front page meeting where they discuss what is coming that day I'm what you expect maybe we're expecting someone to resign are expecting the hearing to happen\nIt's going to get an announcement owned by the way the science desk has this interesting feature that's coming out\nAnd like the night and the magazines going to release this profile\nUm and and we we leave there and with like a ... with a rough outline of of of what what we want to cover\nAnd I think when we think about a story that is a daily story um and is it is a story for the daily it has to be a news event that you either must on you have to understand something complicated in order to understand what's happening in this moment if it's a development in the Miller investigation that we've\nYou know we're adding a detailed to a story we've told a bunch of times we put that in the what we call the headlines at the end of the shell but if it's something where you're like oh man this is complicated this changes the way that I understand something\nOr we need to tell the story of this person before we like it so that you can understand the department of education and this new development\nWe will we will devoted show to that\nAnd there are times where we don't want to do it but we have to blow up the show because because Donald Trump with our president because news happens\nAnd and we resist for hours where we're kind of like\nNo no no nothing I mean how does that mean we can make a headline and this happened this happened a few weeks ago where we were making the series on family separation divided with Caitlin Dickerson end\nAny any corral and we had three days planned and we had the the stories were made by ... by to my colleagues\nAnd um and after the first day there was the the Manafort and Cohen guilty pleas\nAnd and and conviction and we didn't want to cover it because we had this thing planned and a member of the mass had who's one of the most senior editors of the whole newspaper came down to the daily and was like listen\nTo your can't you can't ignore that and we also for like you\nKnow ... the fine\nI'll tell you what like sometimes we defined a show by what we would never recover yeah and we decided as a rule we would never\nWe would never cover yeah and we decided as a rule we would never cover a presidential tweet as an episode because like it's just not enough [noise]\n[noise] there is no I mean like\nIf you think about what they said the only special like swat character suspense morals the like we\nJust like it's just in Congress with who we are\nBut I Will say that there was a there was the day that that um the whole comment was made we we traveled at the same question of like your common comment was made the um we\nWe started with the idea of like how do we do an episode about a sentence and we all are like I don't know like what are we going to say like it that's rude that like just you know it's like it's like it's not that much to say about it until we until we realized that\nThere is like that there was a story that led up to that moment that like\nThere there had been these these two senators from across the aisle who were coming to terms office to present a bipartisan immigration deal and then out or the wings came all of these
