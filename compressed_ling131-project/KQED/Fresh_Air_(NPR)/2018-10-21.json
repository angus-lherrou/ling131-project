[noise]\nI Hope to her where did you get those books I design these boots\nThese are unless someone is copy may not impossible the only wing tips taboos in the world\nUm I ...\nThe person who made these booze was so impossible shut you so crazy that once I finally got these boots which took him two years to make\nI mean you think it was an essay taking that law took him tears to me I thought take care of each was friends you're never going through this again and so people\nVery often say oh you know who made your booze would you recommend them I say I would not recommend him over this guy who lived in Texas um\nFor two years kept calling me in line to me on this guy was a very good looking guy in a very sleazy way and he was coming off this lifetime of lying to women\nShow he would constantly comedy goes I'm really shy him and the Toronto airport and I was going to have to go to Dallas in it and I said I'm conscious I forgot his name I Would say let me explain something to you I Am not your girlfriend [noise] I don't care where you are\nI Can't run my boots are [noise]\nSome thank you for another thing that those [noise]\nThe\nHi Francis nice to meet you Hi nice to I Would invite\nYou to be in my perfect world for a minute where it's past twenty twenty and the Democrats have taken back the house they repealed everything that's gone wrong in the last year and a half\nAnd we're looking towards our new president and you and what would you do in the first one hundred day\nI wouldn't need on British [noise] why do they say why take a hundred days [laughter]\nI mean it's not like you have to write something to really hard\nYou mean everything's already repealed everything is perfect is that what you're saying everything's already perfect that I always say\nI'm finished [laughter] and get on that swelled plane which surely he does not deserve um\n[noise] you know there are as you know I mean there there is not five minutes go by that you don't think someone has to fix that like it is inconceivable although it just happened that the president of the United states addresses the UN and there's less\nI mean\nIt's that's pretty astonishing especially to me who as a child I had to childhood idols one was Leonard Bernstein at ...\nUm you probably heard Lenovo design you may not have heard that before he was the director general of the UN um I have as many books by debt ... habits photograph I'm a refrigerator\nUm and so I always think what would that Congress will think of this um when I was a child or when they took our class you know from school for a tour of the un and when I was like maybe nine years old and I was incredibly excited because I thought I Would see that commercial\nUm and I had a book by about ... and I brought it with me and I were walking around the UN or they can figure out who's going to see him and\nSo a man in his shoe walk by and I thought it was Jack hammer so so I left the line we were always marched round like by heightened in life\nAnd I listen line and went after him and then I couldn't find them because there were many men in suits and I couldn't tell which one he was and so I pushed a door to where I thought he'd gone through an every alarm and the UN went off\n[noise]\nA policeman came over and I burst into tears and I said there wasn't that much security then obviously if I was even able to do this and I kept saying I saw I saw the commercials I thought it was done how much will the guy didn't really know who their coverage for was um [noise]\nSo that for me the un I once spoke at the un not to the general assembly um and I was incredibly excited to be at the un I'm Donald Trump um\n... you may have missed dish but before he was president his only comment about the UN was he didn't like the ... and that he could get them a better deal [noise] on the marble child um so I Will I truthfully think that if\nTile um so I Will I truthfully think that if Abraham Lincoln came back to life it would take a decade\nTo repair the damage that Trump has done I really do so you know uh [noise] I Can't really tell you what I could accomplish in a hundred days um but except for Abraham Lincoln more than most\nYou know pushing African on your lack don't put your head don't reach over someone\nLess has all this stuff nonstop this is my childhood summed up I Would say to my mother can I have an apple and my mother would say that they have an apple\nAnd I was a mad please have an apple and she would say no [noise]\nSo consequently I had excellent matters\nThe most I can hope for in that regard is I have lately been trying to bring back the phrase You're welcome because here's what happens now ... says thank you for coming than the other person says thank you for having me Oh thank you for comes and goes on forever [noise]\nHow I've lately been saying to people they'll say thank you for coming I'll say You're welcome and they look at me like you are so rude [noise]\nSo if you ... like in the Senate is apparently there was that there was this time where the senators walked off arm in arm you know in some wonderful our friendship is certainly much of a better than it is now\nI'm there that would certainly be better a ... you know that there's constant talk about how partisan politics have become I mean is it in a way kind of funny I mean\nPolitics partisan politics is redundant no apologies are part of it and that's the point of holidays\nIt's redundant\nYou know apologies are part of it and that's the point of holidays artisan um the problem with politics is not that they're part isn't the problem with politics of Republicans [noise]\n\nI'm would you please tell us a little bit about your participation in law and order [laughter] um\n[laughter] I have heard that's what I please tell you or at least her um [laughter] about my participation law and order which was a TV show um where\nI played um I had a um a recurring part as an arraignment judge\n'em I got this part by begging them\nTo give me this hard [noise] um\nI I knew I pay them represented play the police captain him and uh that that that I met ... who invented this thing and I should put me on that I I Love loner I still love law and order I Love it there's not the only thing I Know that other people find other ways we're lash yoga spies you know [noise]\nI'm not despise already might imagine but whatever that news ... others like three years that I've become the Dalai Lama [noise]\nI become instantly relaxed and one of my biggest objections to present the popular\nCulture is why there is not a law and order channel [noise]\nBig guys that's the only thing I ever want to see on television is water and show they actually first I'm a we're going to give me there's part as a real judge\n'em and I had gone to audition for it and the producers did there and I I did the audition and I knew I was horrible and the second I stopped I said look I Know it was really bad I said you know if this person too big for me I'm don't give me this part give me an arraignment judge part because that's a really brief by two sentences\nAnd the British had a friend actors don't say I Know I failed the audition\nShow give me a different part I said I Know but I'm not an actor so I can tell you so they did give me this far\nIt was fantastic because first of all you afterwards a judicial robe\nWhich the law and order was done on film show it was just like shooting a movie show you know the work days even if you were on for two minutes or like you know twelve sixteen hours you'd be there forever um the Shaq and I would arrive I Would go to the wardrobe department put on my ... they would say friends you don't have to the role by now that joking\nAbout [noise] and I remember\nThey shot it and then Chelsea Studios which are on the river where they were just started then to build now is finished unfortunately this past you know for people to like ride bicycles and skateboard and like like the whole city turn into some summer camp [laughter]\n[noise] and I was outside smoking\nCigarettes where am I robe and this kid came ... down on a skateboard this kid was like a million tattoos and piercings and he saw me and you stop like that and he said I didn't know there was a court here\nAnd I said there's a court everywhere\n[noise]\nSo I I really love I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed being a law and order I I also real ... uh every other judge on TV copied me because\nWhen you said at that bench which is the best she'd\nEver in any room in the world\nYou know you sit there you're hired then everyone else you have a real comfortable chair and you have a gamble\nBecause the gavel is there I jumped to like ...\nAnd I instantly got dungeons of letters from lawyers and judges many from judges you are not supposed to gamble you're not gamble is for by the way to judge you are not supposed to gamble in less there is an outburst or something
