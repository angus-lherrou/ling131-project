Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYou know we were you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job so\nLet's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode one the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak through such a mess and all of our ego and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up ... by ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nJackets and such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability well he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... maybe minor distinction to us that he was so despondent despairing but he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dimension and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side and he's not trying to\nPaper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak\n[noise] I I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is well or not as low jak horsemen\nI used to be on this TV show called horse around here she do hold your applause will held it was written by my friend her just as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sara Lee him and it was about these orphans in early on the network at a new maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans\nSponsorship of the

of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the horse to water be careful\nMoms of the way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Bolivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced because they're ... gone for good but of course because it's a TV show to knock on for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rise from Mr T. adults in the cast stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show you shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because\nIf everyone's happy to show would be over and above all else the show has to keep telling there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there's nothing more realistic than [noise] you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is [noise]\nAnd ask me saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's coughing you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and you're below jak horsemen there's no cure for that um he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to um let me do you think about that well\nYou know I I I think a big part of this episode and a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but is gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nAnd I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how to reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the need to move out west so many men has so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is the we forgive you awards you created a whole award ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe it for ... that we for\nSure but we forgive you were words as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about house additives\nThat our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible man who do awful things and they're able to kind of like ... back into the limelight\nAnd we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me\nI don't know maybe this is sadly relevance a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture\nNews when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nOr it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks his homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn miss defies me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know we see K. A. or did a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would personally\nFor Warner Brothers and I I don't know if we have a way 'cause we've forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks who's threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he'd beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable but it still feels like we are not you know where we see carry a did a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation\nOr their reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there and maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found a tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is Rafi ...

on Comedy Central\nWatching a series especially like after the eulogy episode I would've thought that you were a bitter man who had a very troubled childhood reading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell your\nParents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so and mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school\nUm you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nOr extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority in the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of money that we're chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah as\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an end to have the the misfit toys Monica um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as a jury or the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them in cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know especially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\n... that look at it and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years you'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out that I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate in long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school\nYou have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too was I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nKnow like one time in math class I\nDidn't realize was inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my pants or everyone can see my underpants Internet inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're watching the boundaries I did because I oh this will be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's\nA ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and save this funny thing and when it was not okay\n[noise] I thought that was more of a symptom as being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the different ... you know the problem with ADHD and other or mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I still am not quite sure\nWhich which to me like a safe space where are you where you can like unless yourself in television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references\nAnd bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them known said made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when he was on that\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation\nThere definitely was a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I've ever seen on television and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer\nAnd having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think if the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto that don't have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation I you know or would it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting it in a story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is running low jak witches Netflix series now the comedy central it's raining it's starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you ... you and your expectation like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks down and make sure there are the right time for Comedy Central\nAnd you know we're obviously want them to keep their dignity as they're not sort of television not out anything too important now as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out\nImagine we still have the closure in Bay poised because of the underground fire threatening gas pipelines will pass road remain shut down the ads have Bailey yeah big trouble in Fremont the south mission on ranching or than six eighty that's close after a big ... hit the guard rail\nSan Lorenzo accident north ADD forest very in a truck in a couple of cars on the shoulder now it's a crawl back in Ninety two Julie ...

which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens work committee is no frills\nHomes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the the Henry Ford hum of building in Brooklyn and queens of his\nUh and so we have an enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties\nAre assigned to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs are they going to look at what's been written about before and they're all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who has at least in his\nTelling his story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father had to pay back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan\nInto ten billion dollar empire and that remains for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make himself a celebrity into Jane a power and ultimately it's worthy campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forties and president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk\nMore about how Donald Trump engagements aspect tax schemes and he reads the richest from his father after we take a short break this is fresh ...\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] this is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter Suzanne crack and David Barstow two or three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged incest backpacks schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and a key constructs now hold Donald Trump ness about how as a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money ... Donald's father\nFinal to him and another siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax schemes we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that emptiness\nIn his own empire so how much money would you estimate a ... gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] and we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars of quakes two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw transferred to down what we\nWhat we also saw it I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never really paid you know he would take out um we were looking at one particular year was like every month he's going back to that\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super like grow up there looking valley baked manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it Hooper micro dot com\nMoney we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nThose Donald Trump took on big new projects for the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch I'm sure it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from God and then being off to raise\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah if you use the money for many of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support died it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several\nSeveral bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in doubt to his father was going to bother these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments\nIt also see that when his so and then when he would fall down surging it was there for Trump safety man was there to catch him\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the story and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nIn the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress in numbers companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump's had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos they're facing a down payment\nAnd for a Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money\nAnd there's like a spirit of Macedonian dollars'\nWorth if it was not a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino trips and it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period how's the lawyer one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and knew well and this quarter soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees the Scottish pool as an attempt by Donald to take control of its empire into potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately turns no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months he was drafted that removes Donald was to Seoul executor from Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\n[noise] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ...\nLife Donald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt to bring 'em to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use the empire of it for Trump\nImpatient rebuild over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help battle Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess they're New York times reporters David

... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death wider Donald Trump make that decision to the interesting thing about\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley bake manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nPrivate sale to his developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSince ... the the uh buildings that were selling those buildings ... Frank comments don't own at that time of his death out there and also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much all empire and it sold them you know the buildings that Seoul in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over\nA hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through the thoughts sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks with value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the ... century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRA\nAsked\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some oil it so some of the tax returns that\nWe're describing the story in fact they are as ours did push back um and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings who made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning to the ... million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is because you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated ah maneuvers to\nTo avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more that's the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the or else which has been hit very hard but budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just an estate tax returns\n[noise] I'm Suzanne I'm going to ask you teach you to either the art video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nWhen public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the or the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of a sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story\nSo at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly with the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene from Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the Mets have how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believes in math and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that\nInteresting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that I you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked and I think that we've ... not I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America um but I think\nTo to move into the bloodstream of America [noise]\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think that how careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents\nAnd it gets really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents to the Trump family themselves um but I think it will take time for us to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access and you were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned who is allowed\nTo go you know [laughter] we uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in to one day with a with a little documents and\n[laughter] it was great but we uh yeah it was ah just the three of us for a year um\nWith a yeah it's a pretty messy would go right to ... and a little ... to either magic and [laughter] and other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding we kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell thank you for your reporting and thank you for telling us about it Suzanne ... David Barstow thank you so much complaint you think you did in ... and David Barstow a reporter so the New York times their article reported with Russ Buettner about\nThe suspect tax schemes used a transfer of wealth from Fred Trump to his children was published earlier this month in the New York times magazine coming up ... reviews the new album by Eric Church who performed in Vegas at the concert whereas shooter opened fire on the audience is is fresh air", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "18"}
