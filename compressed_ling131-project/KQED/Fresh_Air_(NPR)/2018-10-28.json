capable\n[noise]\nHi everyone I'm so happy to be in California uh I used to live out here but now I Lived in Lincoln, Nebraska\nFor I'm currently in the middle of a passive aggressive yard sign more with my neighbors as we head into the midterm election\nWhen I was house hunting in the fall of twenty sixteen there weren't any signs in any yards to indicate the political leanings of my potential neighbors\nI didn't know what this meant and so I asked my realtor a lifelong nebraskan who told me it wasn't Nebraska nice meaning it was considered sort of rude to have a political sign out in your yard I grew up in Florida\nIn Miami a in a neighborhood where the bar for were counted as rude was quite a bit higher [noise]\nMy family help nudge that far higher when they moved in they were the first Cubans to buy into a predominantly white neighborhood prompting the white flight that's made our neighborhood overwhelmingly Latino today\nWhen my dad paid it off he celebrated by burning various health related documents over a charcoal grill in the back yard it's kind of rude actually um he made us all come outside to watch\nAnd within a year he would decide to borrow against the house to help me pay for college they claim they were happy to help me and I believe them\nThey threw me a surprise party when I graduated from college I was the first in my family to do so and it was in many ways a party for all of us\nThey rented a banquet hall invited everyone they felt had played a key part in my writing at that moment\nAnd told me we were going to cousins baby shower shortly after everyone yelled surprise my dad took the microphone and started the ... by introducing one of the few white American families there he pointed to them and said do you recognize these people\nI did not [noise]\nShe said those are the people who sold us our house\nBecause we lived in that house you went to the schools you went you had the teachers you add everything we would not be standing here today had they never told us that house [noise] my the family waves from their table [noise]\nI don't think they knew why they were there on this I think they thought it was a baby shower too I'm\nSentiment that house is so much more than a house\nThat house means destiny opportunity has played out in various ways throughout my life\nWhile married I saved for a house house becoming synonymous with future and with family\nThe first time I've ever owned in Tallahassee, Florida came with a cautionary tale I bought it from a lawyer who had been given the house as a wedding present from his parents who just happens to live in the house next door for reasons that were never made clear but about which the town's real estate agents\nFor reasons that were never made clear but about which the town's real estate agents love to speculate the house had been on the market for more than a year the rumor being at the sellers father had put out a warning that no one should buy it either moved there from Los Angeles and his warning had it made it that far\nEveryone who came to work on the house had a story one contractor told me that when the previous owners had put up the for sale signs the sellers mother came over with a marker and defaced it scrolling at the cost of our love\nThe sellers father would often knock on my door and ask after the baby forgetting over and over again that I did not have children he\nWould glance passed me into the living room with a look on his face it said and why do you need all this space when the marriage ended and the house was sold with it when everything the house was supposed to become I moved to Nebraska\nSingle singing the praises of renting forever that is until ... intervenes a financial planner she'd been recommended to me by an accountant who sensors for my shoe box full of receipts and my habit and bringing every official looking paper mail to me to wear meetings that I needed some financial guidance\nLotto was in her mid fifties and about a foot taller than me she had a wide smile and personalized coasters on her desk she was originally from Mitchell South Dakota and I'd been some missiles famed corn palace once so we hit it off instantly [noise]\nFirst things first one to set after reviewing the financials of my life you need to buy some property in Lincoln that probably means\nA house I did want anyone under forty does in a moment like that I tweeted someone tell me if I should buy a house question\nAmong the responses was a direct message from my former husband who hadn't been in contact in months\nNo you should not buy a house condo though maybe\nJust my two year oh not too since he wrote euro [noise]\n\nFor the first time in my life I had a stable income no debt and no financial dependence and I just sold a house\nI knew I was very lucky and I was supposed to do something responsible with a privilege I asked ... if I could buy a condo\nOr a loft or maybe a warehouse I joked I wanted to be able to roller skate inside of whatever property I own\nA lot of ... all of this down [noise]\nShe looked up from her no pat and said\nI Would say look you've got another Fifteen Twenty years before a fun in a city to support warehouse living [noise] I showed her the message from my ex husband and told her that I'd crowdsource the question\nShe said everything I'm putting together about you it sounds like your number one priority with a property is what I'd call ease of ...\nMeaning getting out of something quickly if I needed to\nIn Lincoln she said that's a single family home but that's not for me I argued homes or for families homes determine everything from where your kid might go to college to how long your marriage were left I was sitting in her office in pajamas hands and then a shirt that said team Gigi and had all sketch it catches them off or Golden Girls process [noise]\nIt took almost a year for law has helped me rewrite the narrative that had been keeping me from buying a home\nIn the one I Would eventually by I stood next to my realtor and its bathroom and freaked out about the size of an at the site of an oversized customs help from Nineteen thirty nine which was built in seats look perfect for bathing a couple of toddlers shook my head and said I Can't buy this house is his first family I see kids in this tub\nMy realtor shrug that's weird I see a tub [noise]\nI met with lawn again after closing on the house I brought many official looking paper she did not need she said the next thing I needed to do was drop will I said no thanks [noise]\nIt was really painful moment that seemed to accomplish nothing um her colleagues still voted for the bill and then she pre figured Christine Blasey Ford who blew up her life to testify that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school\nOnly to see him confirmed anyway and she'd I'm Gretchen Widmer described to me how depressing and demoralizing it was to watch flabby goes through this come forward subject yourself to the world's hospitals scrutiny and then habits seem to make no difference\nBut it did make a difference on the demoralization didn't last and on the Sunday after Kavanaugh is confirmed Widmer held a packed rally with New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's\nIt's just like I was back at the women's march she said the previous day had been really really terrible for a lot of women [noise] but they were showing up and seeing one on one another and saying we've got work to do\nI showed ... my friend's taxed and asked her if we are going to be OK if she was really sure that Democrats were going to do when this time I Am she said I see it every day I talked to people every day\nAnd so we have a lot of politicians and part of their job is to project optimism\nNevertheless if you kind of are in a dark place\nLike I Am often in a dark place um all the way to find some of that optimism is to talk to the women who are out there working their hearts out to stop him you know if you're scared if you were furious if you're a despondent find a Democrat\nAnd go canvas go knock on doors I mean Kennedy thing is is volume um it's the best way to feel good about the world and connect with people as she as what we're told me\nSo I read all the books about fascism I'm like [laughter] if you look at my coffee table you can see why I no fun at parties um but [noise]\nOne of the recent ones how fascism works by the professor Jason Stanley was I think particularly important because it's one of the few that focused on the role of um gender and patriarchy in in in the fascist resurgence and he talked about how patriarchy is close strategically central\nThe fascist politics how because they always seek to cement racial and gender hierarchies and if he put it when women attained positions of political power usually reserved for men or when Muslims blacks Jews homosexuals are cosmopolitan\nProfit for even share the public good of a democracy such as health care that is perceived as corruption he wrote\nSo that sentence and calculates how Trump who's the most corrupt president in American history can sell themselves as corruptions opponent but it also shows why so many women sense an existential threat from Trump that goes beyond his personal Boris ...\nI think women all over the country understand intuitively that his threat to liberal democracy and his threats of gender equality are intertwined\nSoon really soon a majority of women could rise up repudiated repudiate him at long last create a check on his power women though of course not only women could save this country and themselves\nLonging for this to happen and not being a shortage will is almost physically painful the only way to feel better if\nThe only way to feel better to do something to help you [noise]\n\n\n\n\nJust an amazing hat and she's like yeah [noise]\nSo it's our great pleasure to 'em and privilege to Iraq than Asian tonight [noise]\n\nAnd it gives you any opinion writer for a number of years so I'm pretty recently we decided the world could use trade vice so we've launched the abstract to an advice column and she is going to do a little bit of it live for you it's nice [noise]\nI Love San Francisco it's a pleasure to be here tonight and it's gorgeous vases um this is my second time at the ... you know it's

I've always wanted to do an advice column I Love dear Abby and Ann Landers growing up and I read all of the sort of\nPresent day I'm advice column about calling you\nAnd Dan Savage and um\nI even once in awhile listens and Dr Laura who is the ... [noise]\nThere's a reason why I was from the Dr Laura and it has to do a lot of\nBecause I don't care about Dr Laura I think she's evil and part of it\nI actually got a question that I answered in this week's column and it's about love\nAnd so I thought I Would read my answer but I'm also going to read the questions that you know what why as to what [noise]\nIt goes well\nDirect fan I Am a forty three year old single never been married educated mother of one and would like advice on love\nI'm navigating dating life I Need to fully understand the difference between loving someone being in love and having a soul mate\nI Love the idea of love and would very much like to spend the rest of my life with a man but I find myself having commitment issues because I'm afraid of choosing wrong\nI see couples that have been married ten Fifteen Twenty years who get divorced and seemed to be completely fine with it\nIt's scary to me because I Would like my marriage to last a lifetime and my over thinking this totally or being too paranoid or do you really never know because only time will tell sincerely where the hell is the love of my life [noise]\nThey're searching for the love of her life\nWe live in a culture that idealized as the idea of love and the idea that there is one true person who will complete you fulfill all your dreams and love you forever\nWe're told from an early age that are true love is out there waiting for us and so we earned defined them to know what it feels like to experience true love to know you have made the right choice the truth about love is that it is often but we'll during and unknowable you may never know if you have made the right choice\nBut when love is true you embrace all of the unknowns regardless I Am forty four and a complicated romantic situation never been married I Am no expert on love I Love the idea of love but I have lived in love long enough to recognize\nThat there is a difference between the idea of\nAnd the reality of love you never really know if her marriage relationship will last a lifetime you can want that you can work hard to make a relationship work and have the best of intentions instill things might not work out but that doesn't mean you of wasted your time or failed\nMany people who choose divorce are completely fine with it because they know the difference between the idea and reality of love they know there was nothing to be gained from staying in a marriage simply because the idea of love demands pretending everything is fine when such as not the case\nWhat may seem cavalier to you is most likely a decision that has been agonized over\nA few people take divorce lightly because it is a per family painful thing to end the commitment you nurtured and fought for and hoped would last a lifetime\nAnd your letter you are very much focused on what could be rather than what is you worry about choosing wrong but are not considering that you might choose right for a lifetime or write for a moment\nWhen you meet someone and start dating you have no idea where things will lead your hopes yes and dreams but\nYou also have to get from one day to the next getting to know a person deciding to deepen the relationship and sometimes\nChoosing the formula is a commitment and it's so very important to know what you want from a relationship but you also have to create space for a relationship to develop without worrying about what that relationship will or will not become\nIf you ask thirty three people about the difference between loving someone being in love and told me you will get thirty three different answers so I Will simply tell you what these things are to me\nI Am all about the chase seduction and will not just during the shimmering early days of a relationship but also years and when you're thinking about the maddening ways you're a person behaves but still is this a day a good day to send them some for some flowers or bring them their favorite coffee\nWhen you find the one you just know but that isn't guaranteed some people never find the one or there are several\nFor whom you have such feelings or you think you have found the one and they change or you change in ...\nSponsorship of the cake you weedy life's dream finish the firm Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with extended beyond demand\nI Love it when I just want to walk away and give them but still something holds me\nI also think it's important to find a community that you feel comfortable in in San Francisco is an odd city I always think of it as a diversity because I'm from Omaha Nebraska\n[laughter] and so really anything as diverse compared to ours [laughter] um but there\nAren't a lot of black people here and so you might want to go toward Oakland where there is a firebrand\nFlash [noise]\nUm at least for socializing and when you find community you will be able to share your grief with other people who are going to understand exactly what you mean and that can be really really useful and then also the Internet I find a lot of community on line because for until recently I've\nLived in the middle of nowhere and so when I wanted to talk about these kinds of things I found black friends on the Internet and it sounds a little silly but it's been invaluable to me to be able to talk about that when you live in a while not any more but until the first I Lived in um Lafayette, Indiana\nWhich there are not a lot of black people they're either and it's so it was really useful to develop a community on line of black people so that when these things happen and I think oh my God mind going to murder my neighbor um I Know that people can talk me off the ledge and say no don't go to jail for them\nIn a very good\nGood Internet Friends has a very good enough friend\nUm thank you I we have one last question here for Roxanne hello Roxanne [noise] what is your best loved comfort food that you would share it with a dear friend and tough times\nI Know emotional eating to make us crazier than we might already be personally speaking but perhaps speaking for more than just yourself but also food as love ensued as medicine for me and many others how do we reconcile or many hunger is how do you do that\n[noise] oh that's a great question I don't the older I get the more I recognize that I'm allowed to have hunger\nAnd that it's okay to satisfy those hunger is within moderation my dad loves to talk about moderation he walks on everything in moderation okay and I'm always like [noise]\nI got it [noise] um [noise]\nBut it's true I think that a lot of the reason that we see so many people having such unhealthy relationships to joy to food to sex\nTo to uh to vice\nIs because we're told not to have any we deprive ourselves of so much that could make life a little easier and and so I'm working on just indulging when I Want and um my nutritionist has been really into this thing called intuitive eating which is exactly what it sounds like\nAnd it should be that complicated\nBut it's been really useful like when you are craving something allow yourself to habit deprivation never works out and so that's how I'm working on reconciling my hunger and uh in terms of comfort food\nI really love Italian food and I would love to share a good um set of ravioli with a friend or lasagna anything with carbohydrate\nCheese tomatoes and more cheese [noise]\nFrom where she is yeah especially when it's\nMelt the and it starts pulling and it's just like oh this is sex right now [noise]\nThank you for that is that You're welcome um we have a herd of advice from my stand now we're going to end the evening with that conversation with everyone um so I Want to invite Janine and Michelle to come back on stage\nIn la [noise]\nMusical [noise]\nSee coming back out and I wanted to start\nA talking a little bit of women in politics were in a city that knows how to elect women um I
