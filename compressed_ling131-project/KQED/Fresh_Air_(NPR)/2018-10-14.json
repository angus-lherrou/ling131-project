I wasn't offered a whole lot of things I didn't turn down a whole lot of things but um I was lucky enough at once I got into motion picture business which took me a while I'm\nAt least one script would come to me um every year but in most cases they they were something that I was glad to do but then there was some real some ... like\nWhat was I thinking probably I was thinking I needed to earn some money so I had I had to do it you know like beyond Poseidon and if you like that you go\nNo no no [noise] well\nAs you write in your wonderful book which I could not recommend more in pieces valleys new memoir which is this insatiable book\nYou write about how gifted in the flying not in a way got you branded as a TV are digital me round one season forth I'm blind on rent for three seasons so you'd stumped for years about kind of work\nAnd took a while for jumped folks will say oh she's not\nJust applying digital I mean she can do is you\nKnow in my heart I'll always be assigned get yourself\nThis is you know in my heart I'll always be flying ditches so [laughter]\nUm [laughter] no and I had done um actually I did three sitcoms series starting three TV series by the time I was twenty five yeah so I was really you know indelibly on they do not call us we'll call you list out right up at\nAnd I'm certainly it in pieces the when the book and the reason I even talk about those I'm curious if my life and that was that the movement of my career I'm is because I needed to look at my own a habitual\nPatterns my own handed down um history that has taken me a lifetime to understand and the beginnings of my work and my uh career worth so much a part of\nMe becoming I'm not an actor but me\nWell I mean it's interesting that a lot of the book I mean why this was not just established showbiz mental or a lot of the book is devoted to those early years because as you just as you say it's really it's a it's a coming of age or it's a it's a personal evolution story as much as it is a you know\nA a show is more about that at all and and we were talking a bit for 'em you set out to write this book not really knowing where it was going to start writing what six seven years ago yeah\nThat it took me seven years and I I wrote it I'm without really having a notion or a clear idea that I was going to publish it or that I Would have the guts\nTo publish it um I've ruined it for myself because I needed to find out something that I didn't know and um I\nI I think I had been ... with it you know evolved being lifted from for a long time because I was always picking writing classes at you know us UCLA Extension\nOr I'm going to writers workshops over like during the weekends and writing things in in little snippets of this would come flying out of my head um but when my mother passed away I felt an urgency to find something that I didn't know where it was\nI didn't I had thought I'd done all the things that we're supposed to do I have the conversations we heal the wounds if there were any what's done we did such a good job\nSomething was deeply disquieting and it wasn't\nThat I was just grieving that too but it was that something was festering on me and I had to I had to\nPull out all of the pieces and lay him on the table and put them together and see if I could understand a story that he\nDidn't know before and and and to do that I had to learn the craft because it was in learning the craft of acting that I was really able to find pieces of myself and\n... ... ... one of the things I'm really glad we're all include is I'm I'm Glad I got some flaws in ... the uh the mini series you did and back in Nineteen Seventy six and you say in the memoir about this was the first time you had a glimpse of what it meant to be inside a character\nAnd you see there's actually a wine and civil about that character being pieces it's ... it's a multiple personalities story so what if you talk a little bit about that moment of how that started to maybe open you up both as an actor and it has a person who's well\n[noise] well let's see how far that hasn't had I have to take back some um my childhood was complicated to say the least and I had developed a kind\nOf mechanism kind of survival mechanism that um\nWhen when things got too overwhelming to me I sensed pieces of myself that were overwhelmed with emotion and with\nJust you know sort of ... literally not due to a degree\nUm except I can I Swear to God I could act I swear to God and um when I was doing the none um I which I didn't\nWant to do 'em\nAt all because I had by then started to see the you know little sliver of tomorrow a little sliver started to come in of the of the perfect place\nPerhaps you know perhaps I'll perhaps um\nAnd then my stepfather came and I had turned down this series I didn't want to do it I mean it was Nineteen sixty six\nEverybody was running around naked in eating ... [laughter]\nI didn't want to be dressed as a non [noise]\nWant to be running around naked but I didn't want to be justice and not either you know the halfway to position [laughter] so I I I\nI turned it down and turned it down and then my stepfather came over and said if I if I didn't do it um they had called him and if I didn't do it might never work again\nAnd ... and I went oh really\nAnd I got scared so it was the beginning of of learning that every time I made a decision because I was scared it it wasn't the right one um\nAnd I felt defeated from day one I uh I\n... I started to be very depressed I didn't know that it was I was depressed because in Nineteen sixty six I didn't know what the question was um\nAnd maybe I maybe I Would have been all of this would have been bubbling up anyway because I'm becoming a young adult and whatever complicated childhood I had was confusing me and just coming out I don't know but it ... it manifest itself and in eating disorders and um\nYou know just didn't I didn't I didn't\nI went to a doctor and he put me on diets pills because of that at the time they could do that and they were like this big just straight Dexedrine en route them okay\nNow we're happy everybody by far the wider there's somebody tell me about that\nBut then when I hands were shaking so bad in a scene that I couldn't lift up a cup of tea in the scene because I looked like I was really not doing well I and I found myself from drinking a cup of tea holding a saucer and the cop\nTogether [laughter] and the the nuns were blowing that's an interesting way of doing that so I\nWas always something that step in and stopped me from going down these and you know and so one\nDay towards the end of the first year I'm just trying to charge through this\nAnd all of a sudden I'm standing in the mother superior office in all the other nuns around it's one of those normal scenes and all the norm nuns around and we're talking about\n[laughter] ah [noise]\nI I put my hands in my face and I just sold it it just folded up\nAnd in in my head down in my lab\nI started whispering please let me go home please let me go home please let me go home\nAnd he kept trying trying to stop and voice inside and I had to get up get up get up just pop\nFinished but the day and it was Madeline sure was a mother superior and she and she\nShe led me I had my hands doing my face 'cause I was to embarrass them to see\nHow horrified everybody must have been um and and she led me towards the big sliding doors that open to the sound stage and I could hear the honk honk is a thing rolled open\nAnd and she pushed my head down I got him some vehicle that I never I never looked at the driver all the way home I was to mortified and then he took me home and I I think I was home the next day I come to work like\nEverybody how are you off you know very\nThey just ate that hotdog I shut up you know and it\nAnd then towards the end of that day Madeleine pulled me into the back\nI'm into a dark coordinator in the corner and the sound stage and stuffed a piece of paper in my hand and she said the address is very close and you can you can come to stay after work\nI Will meet you there it's the actors studio ... do you know what it is and I said well yeah you know thinking\nNah not so much that I really know what it was but I kind of heard about it and she said I Will not take\nNo for an answer so I met her there\nAnd it was really um the beginning of a huge change in my life because\nI could then begin to hear myself again 'cause if I could get to the work I Would be All right it was when the war was taken away from me that I began to drown and um and then I started working at least offered very intensely and\nUm I desperately wanted to learn a craft ...\nInitially he was quite taken with you he was it it seemed like another you know of another\nOf Providence would deliver you're going to but it didn't go that way with the stress or did it well it didn't it didn't\nIt was like he had it all planned out but um he was really I'm I'm a magnificent teacher but he can be a little cross\nHe could be rough and he could be and you know what we would sit in the ... and watch other scenes and sometimes you know you you feel the other actors\nGo oh my God oh my God how to recover from that you know when when he would talk to some people\nAnd he from the get go\nWith me he was in credibly um supportive and um I went ... you know as much as I could when I wasn't working and you\nKnow it was sort of known that I was one of his you know choosing one or something\nAnd um [noise] so I and I started eventually when the none was over I thank God\nI [laughter] I started I'm\nGoing to his then the ... Institute was he had and his wife and I had started so that I could work with him more intensely I think it was three times a week they were um just him teaching and\nDoing um exercise extended exercises with just with ... and and it was an extraordinary time and then one day as\nI'm also so striving to move in my career on because it's going\nNowhere unless I make it go somewhere and I told myself that I could never blame the them the them\nThe industry the the the unfairness of it all the the the something it it could never do that if I wasn't worried want it to be\nIt had to be because I wasn't good enough and that's when I got good enough\nThat would just change and it was just you know\nForward so slowly and one day I was doing a scene I'm friendly at the Institute and you were supposed to um\nBe generous enough to win another actor asked you to be in a scene with that and even though it was something you did not want to do in a million ... million years you just did it anyway and did your best because you were supposed\nTo participate with your fellow students and I had done that with them and natural food asked me to to play in a in a two character play called the horror the player I think it is and of course I was not the horror\nWas it was supposed to be like the two sides of the same person\nUm and one of them was like the Marilyn Monroe issue character and one of them was the none issue character\n[noise] guess which one she wanted me to fight [noise] and so automatically I\nDidn't want to do it but I ... you know I was you know going to do the best they could and but but I wasn't\nReally taking it seriously and I and by then it was kind of hockey I was kind of shirt myself with Lee well you know\nJust going to fancy footwork chair and a little you know a fair and I'll be\nJust you know that's all everybody with that and I'm Lee first talk\nTo 'em my fellow um after\nAnd he seemed very kind and with the ... when you work at the actors studio what you after you do a senior supposed to say you know when ... or ... or whoever the moderator is you're supposed to talk about what you were working on because it's never finished product it's always a work in progress\nSecret is working on very specific aspects of a character I'm ... and sometimes they seem so obscure I I Would want to say that the actors were a little more reasonable

clearly for me because they're the patterns than in\nChildhood sort of a survival mechanism but as an adult\nThey get in my way they've gotten my way they no longer serve me and I can't I Can't untangle them um there's a saying that what's what's fired together is wired together I'm a\nTherapist a psychological saying that that as a child\nWhen several emotions strong emotions are happening at the same time I'm like for instance\nWith my stepfather and needed his love and affection was magically was bigger than life and my real father ignored me and he my stepfather\nJust didn't turn in was affectionate and so as a child I needed that kind of affection\nBut I felt terrified and so the danger was always connected with love for me it was a stunt man he was literally arrest federal yes so\nYou know it's taken it takes me it's taken me a lifetime to figure out how I can\nJust connect those two because wait a minute that's\nThat those two don't really go\nTogether Sally you can still

and daughters sometimes is particularly when there's abuse happening and the\nMother knew something but didn't know it all it's it's really quite um it's quite extraordinary and I just I Wonder if if as you were writing it did you know all of these things before you could I mean did you discover known from the writing\nBut I discovered in the writing I discovered so much in the writing and it was\nHard to do is hard to get a it was hard to move away from it it became you know addicted to it I'm ... and I I ... you know I Would have it in my pockets in my\nShoes they had because I didn't want to be away from it and I'd be drawn a way to go to work and do other things which was probably a good idea and I\nCome back and it would be sort of fresh but I I\nThe big ingredients the big things I was looking for I didn't discover so I made myself go back and look at it I made myself read\nMy journals that I hadn't written something I had written a very\nKey thing in my journal um you know only like\nFifteen Years prior to this and I wrote it down\nI wrote it down and completely\nWiped it from my brain and yet something in me knew I needed to write it down and it was only in doing this then it went\nWait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait one minute and went and found the journal and went and got went\nOh my God and could peace some things together that we're in pieces [laughter] um and I understand um and I think ultimately what I was looking for was what I felt about my mother\nUm I did not want to feel um that she had left\nAnd ah um that she wouldn't\nTalk me first I needed to haunt me and then I I thought do I am I feeling angry\nI don't know and then ultimately I'm\nAt the very end and when I've done all of this for seven years and I was sitting with my

different you are and then you were seven years ago how differently you feel about yourself\nAnd I went oh\nGod yes you're right I Do and\nThat really is the end of the book it's the last
