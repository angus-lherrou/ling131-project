D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see often that you look out the window UC space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel\nOr or or a green screen that will fill in later you see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule a simulate into San so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire\nSort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside a\nInside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it on that if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense than\nThan the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it\nLooks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh just every indication\nAnd just physical jostling um all of this\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by essay Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ...

I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine but\nI think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\n... another thing that adds to the whole experience has seen this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lesson than\nSay the new capital letter that the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about [noise]\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space um injustice position with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this isn't hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a freaking machinery kind of a uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike a spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a\nLittle drones and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts arts something better just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon fright\nMassive puts together a press state and about the death of a man on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending astronauts Africa stay helping their land on the moon but if they don't say Donald masters preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nYear in high school plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find online and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speeches says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that it's forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures or could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nUh lived their lives and in seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you

at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his

knows about I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was the product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show and then I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess just gave me and she's now he directed the new movie first man and wrote and

[noise]\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's any music actually brought with him to play after the space mining and I write about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about of of the camera that's been described as exotic I\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with all due respect you Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood staff celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience I was like\nBeing on your point of the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nAny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange and I asked somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how do you play music so how did it strike you [noise]\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually sitting there Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neil likes to track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks of music that ah that Neal is with the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but it's you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a than Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know a ... who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play that's track that really no one\nListening knowing and mission control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a little bit of the record that\nWhy don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] oh [noise]\nOh oh\nNo\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nAtlanta Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and into used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... who also directed a lot of land and ready to you and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround show like you hadn't really be done shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nThe you know ...\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a three large stops and starts and and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during and after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with that and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in play Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way out so if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals so yeah I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into that\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you have to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real shy Jeanette miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know a lot of language a complex film but that's going to have like the choreography in a camera work in the dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of things I Do a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with those\nAre all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they went to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my belt and all of us to just go that that much further

consent on campus over the course of three years she interviewed a hundred twenty students from twenty universities spoke with nearly eighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case

a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it spread beyond campuses\nWhat'd you to Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread I guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators and the Judiciary Committee had\nGone to college campuses what'd you think some of the things or they would have been told about ... what did you take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by as the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault\nYeah if those senators had um ban on college campuses best presidents or

is\nVery few women make it up\nVery few women are excited to get there and report and feel like this is their moment in the limelight\nSomething like not having reported for many years is not a big

blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years\nYou were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students had to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it has to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this\n[noise] so um it\nIs there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition [noise] so\nUm you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now it's a yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like gasoline yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now [noise]\nAh yes you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable and their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon already grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at us in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you\nResistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that\nI'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sexes something days ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people not to part is a\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm into an axe we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when do you mean\nWhen one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton some harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once you're in room it's really hard to get out well\nYou know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes you like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little\nDorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may\nRecently you know kind of try to come up and danced with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said\nNo [laughter] no I'm In one of his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happened here\nThat was definitely the first time for me I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him I married um I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to how does that happen and to have young girls who\nTruly a\nYou know art in night clubs or at dance parties a lot understand like this is my buddy I own at people have to ask permission to touch it\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa
