you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um\nStories are obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing college here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak\nWe wrote that story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time in a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a a a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election what was that was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations\nWith foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister in the oval office\nWith a ... or I guess that I really do have consequences Flynn was fired\nSo when was fired within days yeah yeah so you know you helped write the story that Flynn had caused with the Russian ambassador to the U.S Sergei Kislyak telling Kislyak that the Trump Administration would lift sanctions her like don't worry about it\nUh the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration and these cause happened\nAfter the election but before the inauguration\nOn right so how do you have to get onto this how did you start investigating mystery\nWell I'm you know so\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the ... that this really highly politically charged time we're we're living through\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting cards actual letters in the in the mail or thanks for readers from far away places\nUm notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would

he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia innocent version of American democracy\nAnd it kind of brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration stories that have been reported by meller and other reporters that the Washington\nPost now you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that your immunity I was interested in that you used the word lying\nLying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] it's very controversial in the journalism world because mine implies intent\nYou know a false headed is when you speak something that isn't true lying implies that you know it's not you and you're saying it anyways so people are getting just weighing lack is worthy of using the word lie or not she'll you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult\nDecision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true to other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post who was documented\nFive thousand or more false woods from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intent I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se con very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have\nRun fascinating stories here at the post about\nA times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona in St Paul reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a\nThere is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure um you spoke to Devin as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee\nAnd you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing siege by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discuss sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about what who else was in contact with ... with the Kremlin\nDuring the campaign if anyone writes a witness was digging by our news

and all and it's all a dead trail and I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact that you could say that that was incidental and meaning lesson harmless but you couldn't say didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump\nAnd that that was um more important to him in that

I'm not going to trust and not in an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules whether you're a guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knowledge within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really in a really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want one really saying Amish source to report a notice to the source as it's the ... readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know that's not really having any information\nThat's that's the right the sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story in how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well\nWhat does the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story um who are we talking about here and you can you can basically describe their positions in government sometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want to you identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be but\nIt's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up\nThe stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources have almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect and and the and we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nNow there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader um journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right\nLet me try to give you one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types of mental to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation\nBut Trump is also complaining to call me in that in that setting about the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk in the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\n... is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody had on the pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting\nTrump goes on to put joke about putting were just said he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how wants to reporters as a little time in jail they're making new friends suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving\nIt make you afraid well let me let me ... ... ...\nIt made me afraid I ...\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including

and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it and our seven year old was at the table with us and hurt me talking about it and using words like jail\nAnd he's following this conversation that I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nOr he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening and it's um we're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to\nFulfill

Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain

Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain my fifth risk as\nShort answer is just the risk that you fail to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what am I asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top ... risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it different dress now that you've explained what the fifth thrift means\nWhat was the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration has gone about taking over the federal government\nWe're kind of like a fire under me is what I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and thousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course that never been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting to death election\nAnd they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings or and nobody showed up nobody to bring in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprises managing all these risks it imagined that we as a society to spend much time thinking about\nUm if it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought what happens when you do that across a big portfolio risk like the federal government runs and ... would you what happens is you\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fist risk is about the federal government\nUnder Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among and there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now\nTo um the Kavanaugh confirmations story and not as much attention being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you right about now agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem is like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a tree we had a prize the bingo site it we don't say it doesn't function without the government government is is it's been suggested to decades and decades of\nAbuse and score and it's collected rough\nAnd this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know ease pay much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know one aspect of the fifth risk is the go a lot of the risk that the government managers\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up or\nYou know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and ruin lives and another they're all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle\nAnd the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department let all that kind of level of government where things are being done where physicians aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people are there people who have the building\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about innocence to ask how much time including the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in LA yang Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli\nNoah first of all what did you bring in the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and the national weather service is a National Weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of\nGovernment and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an active vengeance\nSo it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there and it is it's the single most important institutions within the Commerce Department\nA and it does it eat most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm\nSo here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has had a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um the problem is that the national weather service uh\nWhich has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut the weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings faster than we used to be able to give them\nAn image and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property a\n... that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a\nHas been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather can do it instead\nAnd that's how the weather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress just sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs ... ... the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that it makes it available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts\nBut what he's been trying to do is organized a sexually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're saying that the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons all the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is a naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a government operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the ... risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option learn more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com and from ...

I Would love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI like the banks are much better capitalized and better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's gonna be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould a figure trigger a financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds of the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world with everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be you know better than gold if that if that is called into question in\nIf that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow was going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would have predicted some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's funny\nWhen you predict things fundraiser predict things where where where they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming [noise]\nMy guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the ... looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nMm Mm [noise]\nIn [noise]\nIn [noise]\nMm\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis his new book the that's the risk is about the federal government under Trump\nA lot of the government as a often dismissed as being a bureaucracy that slows down anything ... subs down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it's just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and\nI'm so lazy stupid people has your has your understanding of like our bureaucracy change through writing these stories\nOh my God I so I didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department the Commerce Department\nAnd I try to having exactly the same experience the political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these some preconceptions but vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like [noise] um this happens over and over again that that a new administration comes in\nIf they have kind of contempt vague contempt for the people who are there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with\nI I expected to be briefed and be you know it'd be kind of informed by these people I did not expect to be inspired by them\nThe kind of person who is still working in our government despite all the abuse the government takes is is a mission driven person they're not paid well\nUh there there 'cause they're interested in the task the people in the national weather service or people who have had a passion for the weather since they were little kids the people in the department of energy or scientists about a passion for that particular size since they were little kids\n... essentially it's essentially what they are all these people are firefighters are in spirit and\nThere's something really moving about groups of people who were doing what they're doing not for money but from mission uh they they have a purpose in life and it just jumped off the page I mean it jumped is jumped into my mind dealing with them and so I came away from it thinking", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
