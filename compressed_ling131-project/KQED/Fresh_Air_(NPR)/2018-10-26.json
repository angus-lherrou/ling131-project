guest\nWriter Michael ... says the money and recognition the sport generates has led to a host of corrupt practices in the recruitment of players were the top college basketball programs talented athletes as young as twelve targeted for manipulation by St agents soccer club described as dealers in human athletic slash\nMany of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to soccer love yesterday when the jury in the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generate\nWell billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it put directly to the universities and to the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does money go\nThe money largely goes to be adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out search teams scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches who make as much as a half million dollars a year\nAll throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries that does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nA couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more players a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing and gems all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scattered not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters who are there to sort of see what's in it for them and the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day\nThey're exploited their dealers in human athletic flesh and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre their kids to when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as an a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino story of corruption scandal in the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nSo in a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to\nYou write that on the college into this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family they\nFly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first\nAnd they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere but the assistant coaches that's the job get me kids\nThe thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach you say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bringing them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government is charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\n[noise] but then some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this\nSo in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bride is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player\nAs your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more\nSo if you're an agent and get\nTwo or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or can over those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars\nIf I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player I don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded there are specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for\nYour new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and a lot of the players want to deal with known quantities and part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money\nSo the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up with a with players\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick

case\n... and in the strip or gay case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees is sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to

Michael ... whose new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked what the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\n... and has had had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and a determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nWhat kind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and then there's certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe one of the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs\nTwenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not real students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their teen first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a priest shifts in the midst of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nThem to come back to one thing you said earlier you said a lot of people knew that the shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking\nQuestions do you have got to make a difference in the future I just think it will\nMake some difference but I think the difference will be\nJust in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get out of certain accounts\nSo they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful sunny the ... the former Nike executive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these\nPeople forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy you also saddened by the way you'd never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the ... companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in\nThese charges the apparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of analysis statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a ... executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and if I were James ghetto who this Adidas executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball insider almost all of these defendants are well liked\nWell known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is these\nPeople were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning on much to change either if they can help

guess Anthony to Curtis is the author of a biography of Lou Reed which just came out in paperback\nCurtis is a contributing editor for Rolling Stone where he's written for more than thirty five years to Curtis new read and considered him a friend although not a close one\nAs part of his research the Kurdish interviewed many people read new including his first two wives read cofounded the velvet underground which you played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen on many bands of the time or singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcribe sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist\nBut he also wrote sons that had a spiritual quality to Kurdish as other than Bob Dylan the Beatles and James Brown no one has exerted as great an influence on popular music as Reid has re died of liver disease five years ago at the age of Seventy one\nTo Curtis says he wouldn't have written this book well read was alive quote this book does not at all times see Lou the way he wanted to see himself\nAspects of his sex life his drug use and his cruelty that he came to be embarrassed about our discussion here in detail as our his generosity and his kindness his talent his vision and his genius unquote\nWe recorded the interview last November when the book was first published and started with the sun heroin from the velvet underground first album\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Lou Reed and Anthony to Curtis welcome to fresh air and congratulations on your new biography of Louis read 'em or you can watch it for pleasure bigger so let's start with that song which sums up so much about what may made Lou Reed different from other music\nWell that's right and that's the thing I don't think they were more homo phobic than that you know they were just kind of a conventional suburban couple of Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace\nAnd you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we are going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWe mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people\nI mean this was a really I mean it it's a very it's an issue very much of the most interesting to me because I'm On a ... a thing and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and said you and say you know you describe this element of flu but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis\nHis sexuality was something I think you know as you gauge the adage you saw what you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of hoping to go in wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for than\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise]\nYes I did want a guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never for giving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran or exactly yeah\nYou know and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap Andrew saying ... everyone has the money we're living in these all these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took lose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said what would your father ever given their money and she said of course he was giving them money you know it is anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed that he and he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his arm he didn't have any money not eat set he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending transgressions that [laughter] I Try to lead they don't have\nAny I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nMy mother always said you know like a you know you should have started to fall back on and kind of typing was bad for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time and make money and if they were they are the right now I'm a great um yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the NYPD Blue quit the velvet underground you know after a show at max Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get back confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you don't have that kind of relationship it was a [noise]\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean you would never meet with them without your sister being there he always refer to them by their first names that was never like mom and dad [noise] um and you know he certainly would characterize them in song\nYou know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well [noise] so early\nIn the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of yeah the kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for a living read\nWell it's you know there's a very interesting question because you know um yeah ... ... or ... anti wanted a band in the same way you do is just like oh you know movies are getting popular and you know just going to make some movies now and you know insurance like we should have a bad year rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know I'm an artist who had gone to see them and thought they might work for him to\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio decided that the the velvet underground we're kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be singer\nToo young to be their lead singer you lose not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was gonna was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports has patient as much as he could you know um she only sign of you know a few songs\nA band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band and as soon as he could have gotten the you know he ... a band as well\nAfter having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a year so that was one of the issues with Warhol\nA Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid a New Yorker I'm at a time where I was in the newspapers all the time they're not\n... you know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like obvious crazy guy you know he thinks they're Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention and uh you know Lou trick advantage of that\nBut that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back that was pretty Ernest thing and the I wore host seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who you know how to turn them yet you don't hurt our amazing there so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know this needs to be more professional operation and you know there's no way of the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nMy guess is Anthony declared is the author of the book Lou Reed uh life it's just been published in paperback

produced by David Bowie and you know always of course famous for all of his you know ... and for his sexual fluidity what impact did working with David Bowie have on lead in terms of\nHis self image and his persona\nWell you know Lou how complicated feelings about that um\nYou know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David belly was kind of you know the coming thing\nAnd uh you know Boeing you [laughter] you know as with Lou like there was a very conventional aspect of but we I mean much as he was a boundary breaker he always you know kind of respected his elder you know and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list\nAnd so he you know bully offered to produce transformer and restored\nYou know lose standing after the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit\n'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record um [noise] you know some new of course once you got the hit that he desperately wanted your kind of came to ...\nHit that he desperately wanted your kind of came to resented than you thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player mc ... who co produced that album with ah with with David\nUh they created that song and also you know of other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lou\n... walk on the ... from that album\nAnd um this was his only real like radio hit and it was a big hand I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about it and\n[noise]\nCalling from Miami ...\nHitchhiked way across the usa [noise] ... rounds on the way to save their legs and then he was she she says the the\n... said hey honey take a long while or [noise]\nUm [noise]\nCandy from out of the island\nActually read walk on the wild sign his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie\nI'm so that so that was actually a head friendly but it's not architects from your book like he was a cat he wanted to hit so badly finally has any sounds like it was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more than ... yeah yeah precisely and even if you did have hits [laughter] you know you\nGot a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so\nThe degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh and ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record\n'em [noise] so you know he would turn on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed his stand you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career as just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that was unsinkable before Lou did it and I'm\nJust I didn't want it he wanted to have his music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter] honestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it\nMhm mhm [noise] um\nSo I'm ... ... you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed [noise] um well one\nThing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a Richards documented quite movingly or in the song street hustler part call slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview again at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially they're saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of lots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Lu got clean or got straight\nAnd um [noise] and his gay life became something that I mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or are you\nHe's so honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know\nThere will be reference for speaker of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings\nAbout Jews um homosexual life and even if he was out there as anybody could be also turned on it and are often not with that you know that much um\n[noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different ... of St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure what the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so cold just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to it yeah it's great music and it's great writing\nUm so it didn't in the middle part [laughter] on a street hospital trying to think about that that's part\n[noise] yeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory was found dead\nOr industry a as an thought to be kind of study which hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial storey deck with da da da da da and somebody's apartment and they have dragged 'em out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nOf a new turns that male character into a female character and then you have described the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his ... to get just girls body out of his apartment [noise] let's hear it it's just ... [noise]\n\nYou know in ... and it really wasn't nice jogging and I really wish that there was no time to speak\nBut you know can be it has been trying to please do no matter how was your old guy and it's not like we did that when I was new and new and it was the main you know I when I first\nWoman who is there anything that we live within our own universe two major [noise]\nThe way that is really you see that on\nThe move around the girl\nWorse is is I don't have to get a woman and I know I Know when a tree to\nRemind your ... manages around in the dark energy and by mornings you know they get more on [noise]\nYou know people I Know what show is winning and never mind the", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "26"}
