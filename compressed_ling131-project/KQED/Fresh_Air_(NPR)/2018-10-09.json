it at the same time and it transcend in quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is traveling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice is complicated quality of whatever pain or English and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that uh that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that his son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they haven't met that have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nTheir hands and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems\nSo I've always wanted to I Want to get on record as say what I Know\nAnd I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song I supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly some into this book in observing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line to their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds like her father I'm going to fight not being keg ... can tankers or in transit you know it's just\nIt's a ...

about songs\nAnd sing is but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing at ... um but but you are you know your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that sign riding much craft that's something people actually did\nAnd the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them and you're a you\nKnow of course they heard them yeah no I I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a far looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner will sure in ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and\nWas expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said man you've scrap\nYou record that's an amateur move sandwich or move he says yeah\nIt's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and do something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah that baton off the ground [noise]\nHow old were you and your parents separated um five six the don't remember how much did you get to see your father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people you should have been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some uh was remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims\nAnd my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nFeed always you always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\nCaravan has like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid he called is like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm okay yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived a\nLong dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he put at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there my mother\nThe tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care as long as you're not that far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and you know\nAs I say the ... the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate ... which he contorted his own life and scheduled to to make sure that he was present in our lives was a feat\nThat there's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for his re connection to people I'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain your father savings\nAnd so all the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like steam so we'll just sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with the song and poetry I'm an incredible\nWas [laughter] the to the canon of his work with his devotion to black eating pages melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um [noise] when you experience this this episode that you're referring to it actually to compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence makes the heart grow fonder who knew [noise]\nI always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and than others you know would quote him and [noise] um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I was a festive I

intelligence community and the author of several books\nEmerson ... writes about conflict and social media and was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations\nEspecially as Dave Davies spoke to them about their new book like war the weaponization of social media\nWill be W singer and Emerson broken welcome to fresh air\nYou know we we all know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in this book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming a military offensive this was the German invasion of France what happened\n[noise] so you have this new technology that are connected\nEverything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population is wireless communication and radio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes\nOr the rise of Nazi ism goals uh said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also hide strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France and invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all their military unit in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population and sporadic contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of these things that the contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figure it out really radio was what a cause all cause of the world to change\nAnd we saw many of the same things play out in the rise of ISIS at a broader level but also it's a military operation if surprise invasion of Iraq that allowed it to defeat a force that was a multiple times bigger it's part of these ways social media is in effect change the world\nThat's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has

battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign\nThey were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject to virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign\nThe\nCampaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is it the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far and is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered\nThen Hamas would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies if one side or another ten million and all in this first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set of model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nTwo

one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of a two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the double gang or a narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again and again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like\nAnd the bottle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative be buried underneath you even saw attempt to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history we compete here so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go on to a PDF very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the ... hearing where ah he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook that sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week if you do you do you make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks as part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some ways to pass um human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas a light customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on a war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes\nThese are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I ... back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so these neural networks like that could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden uttering some you know profane a comment at something\nTo give real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can layer real and fake imagery\nReal and fake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expression but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data point to what their face looks like\nWhich are by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that to meld together to allow you to a an essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
