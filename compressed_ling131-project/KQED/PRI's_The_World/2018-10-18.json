get\nAn update now on a case that also touches on issues of freedom of expression you may recall the name Laura ...\nShe's a University of Florida graduate who was accepted into a master's program at Hebrew University in Israel all cause some was granted a student visa to travel there but when she landed in Tel Aviv two weeks ago Israeli authorities revoked her visa\nAnd barred from entering the country reporter Daniel ... has been following the store and she joins us now so there's news on al ... case today Daniel what happened\nBut the news is that the Supreme Court and Israel rural that her student feed that should not have been revoked and she is now being released and her lawyer is on the way to the airport to pick her up\nSo take us back and remind us what the dilemma was for Israel in for Lara al ... who is she in why did Israeli officials detain or upon her arrival\nAt the heart of this issue of America is that Israel passed a law in twenty Seventeen that allows it to bar entry to foreigners who are involved in calling for a boycott Israel and Israel state layers said that al ...\nFather inside of Palestinian descent and that she was the president of students for justice and Palestine a pro Palestinian group while she was at the University of Florida\nAnd she present an ongoing risk are calling for a boycott while in the country and until now the lower courts have sided with the state lawyers but her lawyers said that she hasn't been active in that group for more than a year she also said that she wouldn't support a boycott while she's in Israel\n[noise] so how does the kind of dominated conservative political class in Israel see the judge's ruling\nThe Hebrew University supported by al ...\nAnd the eating center lawyer back her up but education minister Naftali Bennett he's from the far right Jewish Home party he said that that that was an improper move by the university and when I was at the court case last week in Tel Aviv I asked Israelis in the neighborhood what they thought a lot of al\n... case and they said you know if she doesn't like this country she doesn't need to come but there are definitely other people I've heard say this does not look good for a country that cause a tougher democracy\nAnd as opposed to the hearing that I attended in Tel Aviv at this hearing judge it seemed to be very skeptical of the way that the Israeli authorities were interpreting is two thousand Seventeen law\nSo now Laura al ... is free to go to classes as Hebrew University any sense of what her life is going to be like when she gets or is she going to face pressure\nFirst of the any sense of what her life is going to be like when she gets her is she going to face pressure not to get involved in activism\nEarlier this week some student put an empty chair and class saying if he gets reserved for the past them and they wrote it also and\nThey and then that time when they faced by right wing or as they can see that her presence\nHebrew University is definitely going to raise questions but she's also and any program for human rights and transitional justice her fellow classmates are going to be dealing with questions around that very issue that she challenged and so I'm sure it'll be a ... year it's plenty of academic and non academic thing to discuss\nDaniel ... thanks very much for your time thinking
