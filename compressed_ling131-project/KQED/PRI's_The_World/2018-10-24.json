afternoon at three o'clock\nA market where this is the world lately things have been pretty tense between the U.S and China not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nNow contesting America's geopolitical advantages been trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the blog one column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nIt doesn't have to be on China is extremely keen that it should not be so don't even wants to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one end to work out what America wants\nBought it used to be just a few hard liners here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiated with the America wanted to contain China and still China's rise that fringe\nOf hard line is is

that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful them and this has come out of out of the blue and\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of the the dishes like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nA try I mean those are those ... a retired very senior American\nOfficials in Beijing last week and it was off the record like on sort of navy man but he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to try and a lot for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him and he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants\nOn you know I was discussing having interview Trump the times about trying to understand in\nDC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there was something to this\nThat the problem is that the machine in Washington\nHas kind of systematic structural things but it wants China to do differently\nTo play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say mark ... to you know to what was something like the TTP by everyone opens their markets that bull Donald Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ID so I think if\nYou look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if\nYou know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world to access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump stock in his real estate ... says he he he owns a valuable properties this time it's called the United states and it's\nTime to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table but there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you paid a low rent I I think that's the quote unquote Donald Trump is up to right now\nWhat is China's vision for the world\nSo he's a really interesting thing the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China\nChina is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know probably that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nThat's the go how'd they get that\nIs not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one ... they'll try another\nIf there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and and\nFor a long time they were gaining the world trading system and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months ago trade tensions and you get this when you talk to European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike\nMore as an American led world trading order is no rules a tool and so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gave me the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are\nQuite in the order of reforming the WTO no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of\nThis one of these moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive\n... is the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction\nOr an absolutely confident Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because\nReasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down the list of people who can explain what comes to then they got ... down the list are asking people like me and I literally have conversations with what I say I'm a reporter it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase the few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese yet\nSo she says this was an ancient Greek historian who wrote about when you had a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably lead to war and so he's been analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart and in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich that trying to become\nMore powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for trade will let alone a shooting war\nSo they're just not gonna stop sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of funds from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person these kind of man and killed some time to kind of New York real estate guy\nI'm so they think that as people ... go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries that no longer thinks that they are confirmed\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks sanity from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nSo the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wouldn't do before trying to get so big but it's too late to stop it that it's a window to try and ... there was this extraordinary and gold and Trump said I think it was in the U.N General assembly speech when he said the\nPrevious presidents should sort of been ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so she that's really extraordinary statement in a previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of\nA member of the ... ah uphold the international order along with everyone else but Sedona Trump to say at least to the piece of rhetoric\nUser Dara ... is a Brazilian researcher now in Boston starting all this at Harvard joined student center she's also involved in an effort called ... over a collaboration between twenty five Brazilian newsrooms to identify and the bunk fake news\nCarnival tells me that the big story she's seeing on what's up are out of control\nWe make fun actually because the the misinformation campaign in review they sometimes can get absurd in what way at their support in in being nice and fears that are totally known things like\nVenezuela is supported by Hezbollah or stuff like this and I was coming here and I had a discussion with a friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the White House\nTo identify and the bunk fake news carnival tells me that the fake stories she's seeing on what's up are out of control\nWe make fun actually because the the misinformation campaigns in Brazil they sometimes can get absurd in what way at their support in in ... and ... years that are totally known things like\nVenezuela ice important by Hezbollah or stuff like this\nAnd I was coming here and I had a discussion with a friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the right wing candidate was the antidote to brand new not becoming a Venezuela supported by Hezbollah so\n... was this teacher Brazilians she's busy and\nShe's Brazilians you've probably heard this thing's\nAnd I I started to last you know it's like yeah you know what listen here's the website of control over this is ally this this this is nonsense please you're a teacher at Harvard [laughter] but people believe this thing's\nSo is that one of the rumors that Hezbollah connection with Venezuela is that one of the members of spreading on what's happened Brazil\nYes this is pretty new this is fresh room or [laughter]\nThan there are the older still remembers making a comeback as Brazil's president ... seats up\nFor example we had a little more about the last candidate being the creator of something called gay Keith which is supposed to be an educational cheat to teach kids how to be gay\nWow [laughter] the the implication being if you vote for the left wing candidate you're going to have gay kids in\nSchools and there will be connections with the government\nOf Venezuela and has a lot of the same time I see what you're saying absurd um just to be clear what definitive links have there been between these disinformation campaigns and either political candidate like the charge a ... in our own launch those yeah that'll legitimate claim\nThat there's a rule more from\nTwo thousand twelve it's just you up in the website of the right wing candidate he created this a false information\nHe was a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to the Congress and several Congress person that are religious they supported him in the story and this became a monster\nBoth so now it was also accused of creating another monster a big one last week a Brazilian newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firms to buy a bundle of phone numbers and use them to mask taxed propaganda to Brazilians through what's up\nBrazilian authorities are investigating those claims in the meantime people like you as a direct quarter of a are trying to put out the flame before they turn into a fake news wildfire in Brazil\nWhat's very interesting is that as far as I've seen of watch the news in this information\nThere is no story that is not in both platforms Facebook ... what we see a different types of presentations\nSo would watch that you have an all you see like there's this thing happening you have to act so there's a call to action that's very strong\nShared this otherwise our country is going to be a very nice way Elaine five years share this to save our country\nStuff like this on Facebook you have the same narrative is the same narrative but Facebook is more sophisticated they have videos have text\nSpecialist so opinions all the things that make people believe still what I see is that there's an entire system if you look just to watch that uh we're not getting all the picture\nI mean I I I don't want to suggest that Brazil's different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have on as social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake news and what what are those guys I think we have a huge inequality and poor people are left behind him in so many things including education\nWe have a level of instability that was provoked biting peach amount of humor that may people is a former President Bill yeah\nAh they make ... made people believing in and they don't believe in these situations anymore neither the government or the newspapers\nFor and I know there is no issue tuitions that they would believe right now and um this is also very important when you study fake news because people tend to believe in the misinformation contains instead of leaving the institutions or newsrooms\nThat was ... on how fake news is playing out of Brazil's presidential election\nQuarter of a study this information out of Harvard showing student center she's also involved with ... a collaboration with Brazilian newsrooms and social media companies to take fake stories of their platforms the runoff election in Brazil by

reason the shipwreck has remained in such good condition for so long is the water it's been submerged in for centuries the black sea is and knock sick or free of oxygen and more than a mile below the
