last year you know it's sort of being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't know what he's doing that he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody it has been generated nearly as much heat save the letter bomb story which is\nThe reaction that Kristof described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here where they're saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension\nUm that's generating a lot more passionate about what each then the salt that someone's a hack Donald Trump's iPhone\n[noise] now I Can't have a journalist from Germany and a journalist from Greece in an interview without asking you both you know your two countries have had some tensions in recent years you

... very very much the situation of the relationship between the two countries I think it was um quite good\nJefferson how does it feel in Berlin yeah I I Would pretty much agree with\nThat so I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany doesn't command or tension here probably as much as we command there that central air but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get their economic problems under control they basically done what\nThe Germans have asked to them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou can look medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know I mean compared to like [noise] all bonding hungry you know I'm a going out for a meal with which the prime minister of Greece is
