the investigation into an atrocity committed a few years ago more on the science and the investigation in a moment first a warning that you're about to hear some graphic details in this story the story begins\nAs I said with an atrocity [noise] this is a moment from a video that went viral this summer and it's a killing is about to take place soldiers are walking to prisoners down the road you can just about here one of the soldiers whistling while the comrades is filming and commenting\nOn not allowed to [noise] you know reduce the emphasis on\nThe prisoners are two women plus a young child and a baby [noise]\nTwenty two shots were fired in all the women and the children were killed\nBut it was unclear who was shooting or where this happened at first glance against might be that it's somewhere in Africa but that's about it\nThen a team from the BBC's Africa I investigative unit went to work and thanks to science and technology they managed to zero in on not just where these killings happened but also the identity of the likely shooters those alleged shooter's are now in custody\nTell me a lot of people the b._b._c. African security correspondent joined us from Nairobi a really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually cracked the case\n[noise] well I think first of all it was just the shock that gripped everyone who saw\nThis video right from the beginning and it began you know just conversations across to each other with different research is reaching out and say does anybody know whether this is anybody have any idea\nWhat the what the terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a full on the investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology plate in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean it parts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is why it across west in Central Africa a botched with many\nHeads put together I one of them was Amnesty International the rights group which had been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and\nYou know looking at the uniforms listening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty ... such as well they suggest that this was camera and this was northern capital of course that's also a vast region but over time\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's

Stanford ...\n... s and digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location that's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that rich mine match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only original and that has that shape and all of camera room\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy but they'll so many clues put together so it's not just\nThe rich line I could be any Richland but when you have one\nClue when you have another clear you sort of bring them together and that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed was it was when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that and adding everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also worked with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experienced in this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nFirst of all the government tried to deny initially that bees ... soldiers they said you know the uniform on was not watch\n'em dead soldiers would wear up north um they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army also found some of the the uniforms\nBoy indeed ... military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and found that those were Kembrew Indian soldiers but then in the dialogue is well some of the soldiers were saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy bucked around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested\nSeven men seven soldiers so they changed that tone and said well they had the rest of the sudden people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official name zone so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to\nMatch some of those details of your show you know you're from church on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier called ...\nAnd apart from just to Facebook you know we found a way to speak to a former camera and young soldier who also confirmed that they was indeed Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to shoulder and including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to today's uh women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram and\nThere's a point where I Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of\nA tells us child that um you know sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and\nUm basically saying it's it's the parents' fault that you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers at Fort in these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback to this investigation has a BBC Africa gotten from the public like from Cameron in Niger itself\nThe feedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by the message\nYou know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the angle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fire up the audiences [noise]\nUm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that mall can come out a temporary and people in particular but I've been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and their forces accountable\nThe video or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm if it's not an easy video to what to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen at festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nAnd it's something you can't really you race from your from your mind so uh it's not something easy to watch\nA but it doesn't necessarily job to to be done to when you have to expose these kinds of things I'm the last of atrocities around the world sometimes you have to go to the hard way uh to be able to to get to the depths of of these things and expose them\nThat's my colleague told me a lot of people the BBC's Africa security correspondent thanks very much You're welcome [noise]\nNews headlines or next year on the world\nSupport for ... comes from Rogers behavioral health offering PMS an innovative non drug treatments for depression when traditional therapy and medication or not enough\nAnd so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access to the need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like ... emergency just already we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work walks but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of mount mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc\nIt's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it but you know they've just been transition there\nFrom a different facility and they don't know anyone there just oriented you know they're awfully upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um and it's quite stabilizing\nYeah amend my mind kind of boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access [noise]\nUm well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent shelters are provided with and you know I Know you're right ... and um they receive screening\nAnd so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenue [noise] um\nYeah because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that turning into 'em at the campus already and you know the access to legal services there had been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it\nUm how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we have a system we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection country we have that in place [noise] you know could it improves short I think what's really missing is investment and stuff and there's a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nOf those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process\nInstead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the passage doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in a system we may need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not a ... it's not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I I Am hopeful and the sense that I think I'm I'm I'm\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know\nDoing a lot of visits certainly to different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from\nFrom a rival to the immigration court so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously it's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsors as soon as I Will\nLead to trouble as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much\nPresident Trump's crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency\nThis change what essentially mean anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy so she's already seen it happening but loosely the pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule is a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as\nMedicaid or snap on so called food stamps or forego those vital services that include healthcare Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to childhood family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still proposal phase but what showing effects are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with family society to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nOf this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even ... or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages that parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you couldn't tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so as recently as last week I care for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as with many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so as you can also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nAnd so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined\nI'm and she said that she had heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S [noise]\nSo so I worry about this baby and many babies and similar situation to start in their lives without all of the support that they can get if their families were not being placed in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months and I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a process possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal says\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either stability in the U.S with\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver di di di you\nTo make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately have an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so\nWhich which really is a lifeline for a lot of my family as they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nProvides healthy foods and includes housing assistance I'm In other services that actually allows them to be healthy and stable so that they can contribute to the United states ... our society\nDr lawn rifle Lucy pediatrician

so you know about a remarkable story will have tomorrow it's about a man named Jesse he lives in California he comes from a Mexican American family he's been incarcerated for half of his life\nAnd he

going to get beat up at worst you're going to stab\nBut that's not true in every president we go to one where change is happening and inmates like Jesse are part of the change that story coming up
