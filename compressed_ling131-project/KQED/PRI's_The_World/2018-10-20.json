[laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou are listening to radio lab [noise]\nRadio from W. N. Y. [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... Hi I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't seem to where we have to say that we don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we might as well we've noticed is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make you wanna yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight Georgia how about what the song yes please check\n[noise] [laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass doors headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is on a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you there are guys\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie me or\nWhat are you calling for their same\nNurse in has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small peaceful protest will turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shots Facebook triggered hordes asking what would become a loud Facebook do Facebook rockets\nOf global\nBad embattled the look CEOs barter day playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches [noise]\nBut but rather something that I think is a deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say again by Tony photograph what we\nCan see and what we can feed lot Mueller white kids on the\nOn the Internet\n\nThank you Mr Chairman and Mr soccer America got to give you subjectively prioritize or sensors speech what\nCongresswoman we don't think about what we're doing is concerning speech\nBut there are types of what what what really grabbed me was\nWas discovering that underneath all of this is an actual real work\nEight text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion\nOf us can say on Facebook digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and die in bullet points and it's been statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like what are these roles how were they written\nAnd can you even have one rule book\nExactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that\nThat underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two\nBillion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd die in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like\nWhy are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Google Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch to just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again\nKeep in mind this isn't nearly two thousands seismic change in this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path my space time is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things would come up onto their screen flagged her to Facebook and on Lake meaning like I use their saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate chronic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd every time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard or what\nKind of they had a set of standards that day at the end of the day they were just kind of that is one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry different the guidelines were really one page long there are one long\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so is Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[laughter] rise up sites for the rights that replicating\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger on line group who had organized ironically\nEnough through Facebook so to coincide with the life protest they just you know take up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then change their status\nTo the title if I could have a Facebook message feeding is not a team and it caught on social networking website is under fire for any policy on the women's regulating their sheltering twelve thousand members participated and the media frequently started pouring in the face of a\nBad thing is I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine New York

building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack scene where they get their dishes fix the country for everybody fever English and we sent them\nThere to try to talk to some of these people through for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like [noise] well\nUm I generally we\nFound out pretty quickly like none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting femi happening\nLess certain about the good work I work in the city so now I don't I start to find these you know sorry do you work in\nI Know you're lying in fact\nMost people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that defined\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather live that's totally fine you know I just got a ... a year\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike ... are headed for about ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers\nAnd the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to ... or ...\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you already know impact at ... ... ... yeah I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to she he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ... sorry\nCan I just I just I ...

you're just tuning in this episode contains graphic content some strong language\nWhich must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing I don't give me their kids in the room\nMate would have hit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are there and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nAin't gonna let Rhonda Merrill aside but sorry my aunt had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we have some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carl\nMonday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bombs [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston there [noise]\nYeah as sort of does begin to settle\nPeople are springing into action\nOr just one man in a cowboy hat\nSees a spectator who who's been injured picks them up rose him in a wheelchair\nAnd as they are pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud says there's a photographer there any snaps is [noise]\nAnd the photos show was the runner and the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh his face is Ashton from all of that debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ... meanwhile\nSays new CDOs fee and we used to be on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees were clustering around several desks staring at the computer screens watching the news ...\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published\nOn line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order was that's here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly [noise]\nSort of going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this images reading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down at a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yup however half the ... says\nNo the other people are saying this as newsworthy\nEssentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receive push\nBack well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvement we made the guidelines for a moment like this to which the other side shoots back oh my God\nLine for a moment like this do edge the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking your down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here let's be humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff back in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally clear they decide to take the photo down but\nBefore they can pull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order\nWe were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes oh yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher were but they don't think maybe they have made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization yeah\nAnd this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should\nBe able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now and news organizations strengths parents here let me\nLet me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook\nIs and this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter just as her\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and responsible for your conscience which makes it kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside\nWhat what what really strikes me about all of this\nIs is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective for geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy you know give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or\nThat happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of
