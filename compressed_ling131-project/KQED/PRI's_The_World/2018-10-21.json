directory so Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nDo you consider yourself a minority and if not\nI have to answer this question many many times and it started with the fact that from the day I was born until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are so my brothers are my family\nJust kicking off a bomb personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump announced set\nBecause did she votes where I was in India that she was Native American in July he escalated I Want a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by if you take the test of his shows you're there\nThis week Warren responded by way above five and a half minute ... campaign video in it she speaks with Carlos Bustamante Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nAnd the hunger genomes you did five five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence\n\nNative American ancestry with very high confidence [laughter] is what we have a Native American ancestry and your brother\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated\nShe came out and thought she scored it first showed the media and it started than men and got old Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are you sort of DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and the last appropriate accusations that she's not native enough\nThat she is reinforcing biological essentially some that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms that she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bottom sides\nA political miscalculation but also a stone into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess when their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nCan tall ... professor of NATO studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not governed so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA\nAnd ever since talk of blood is lineage and fate\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture I\nCaution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum these are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors\nThe dog allotment act at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land her hands of household and of course only men and settler ideas of family not the time to be has household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities didn't necessarily have lists with names if there are people in there Ken these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you weren't descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base Raleigh you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and around the whole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there\nIt's not as if blood the physiological substance in being examined\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were for us it's who's your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base Rome but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining around the whole blood\nWhere you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native\nNow my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood role instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate that every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to money\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bike super like grow up there looking valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware

discussion of race and and blood then the women men this is something much she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his times\nYou know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma and the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family's story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nRight but but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important to them\nWhy do you think they do it\nI think they're very much influenced by that one drop rule that is so prominent in racial discourse in the United states\nAnd the housing market between forms of

follows the life histories of two sets identical male twins\nWho were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of those little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born and somehow didn't amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins\nSo the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later so they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other I went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and good colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade\nBut I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical histories are amazing the one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "21"}
