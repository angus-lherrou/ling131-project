wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this t._v. show uh sensibly entertainment\nYou may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality talk show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess visa overstay ... people who are\nWorking against the terms of of their views in Japan mistake people you're there with them in the car um they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggest their deport it on the next plane type thing\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called ... which I guess translate says Koch at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show or in Japan called a Tylenol shoe guy which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada Brian from for example uh we had a show like this that account of the border services agency\nCollaborated with with the producers and actually the Canadian government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless and it was only taken off the air because of the ah\nThere'd be contravene privacy regulations Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very leery and breath was um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's just it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in writing pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to the\nThe dormitory were some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in the ministry of marriage and so you so hurry I'm you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there's a camera\nYou know you're driving down the road it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face so everything is word out including the like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood um the people who live there would probably complain in ... criticized and so it's just like this was like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out\nImages you can't see people's faces voices are describes is quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that followed these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because uh the the program did to cooperate with ah the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they they I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to immigration agency and get more resources\nI assume there's going to be some work your efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan what have active it's been saying\nWell I mean yeah at least on line there was considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant and its\nJust an activist who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant rich anti racist movement and so yeah they they basically said ... entertainment like why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of cars I mean like ... the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstay their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it'd be it'd be obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases the boats people from other countries have a they don't speak our language they look a bit different and and they're coming over here and taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'm not sure like uh\nI think it's just kind of a ... kind of cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended up getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing [laughter]\nYeah I mean I I guess you might think also we live at a time\nWhen around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for Brexit or invasion of Crimea so maybe people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that\nSomeone is doing something to protect us here\nNevin Tom Cindy Japan editor for global voices thank you
