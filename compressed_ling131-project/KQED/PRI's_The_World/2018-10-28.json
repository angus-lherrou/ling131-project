R. G. slash elections to find out [noise]\nMm\n[noise]\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield when election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three\nA yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns to state too it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has Fisher the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on free campaign\nWhen did not question [noise]\nEnter a woman can walk around\nDown down down man\nIt's almost comical a anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political homey op uh see the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trans went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trends related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there is no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nMore able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with him\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other groups like trans citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we\nDid the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys three days three weeks six weeks and three months later\nIs that when we compare the group that we had the conversation with at the door versus the group we could have that did not\nThat treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is that if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and that average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big\nEffect does this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing one\nThing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads it'd be affected the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effects we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... now does your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy owned a matter of campaign theory\nWe're actually entering this really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine moves from putting leeches on people and tell the anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we're kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there is different versions of that actually depending on who you describe too but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of\nVolunteers who have to fan out in the community which is why the campaign industrial complex is built around television advertising so let's just say\nWas built around television advertising\nSo let's just say the effects that you found in your studies hold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign or twenty six team that beat or ... campaign right now in Texas and many others who have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so\nFrom my perspective if campaigns don't try and really\nThink about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents at it I think it's also a vision of American democracy the normative leap might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or to do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team\nYou need is a candidate or cause that many kinds of engaged individuals want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical floating on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election results that's kind of the traps that that research on campaigns and elections in campaign consultant has been for a hundred years we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nIf they had done something else which of course we can't do because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and you know reorientate all their activities around it within the next year I Hope on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence base that\nHe's very persuasive and rigorous and the prejudice reduction advocates uh will be interested in applying in their work\nDavid thank you so much sure thank you David Brock man it's a political scientist at the graduate business school of Stanford University Matt collect has been reporting on the question three campaign for the WNYC podcast Nancy\nMatt walk and talk to him things up I'm All right so in the late summer you went up to Massachusetts and you tagged along with the door to door campaign in
