world we've\nBeen talking immigration and free speech today to things our next guest a Chinese dissident artists I way way has also been talking about as he prepares to move back to a city he once called home New York\nThat reality is about how you as a nation still have power to accept the difference still have an allergy or do young enough to pick up the challenge and have a mission and a and a half of the big heart\nBut what if that American Heart grow smaller asks I way way\nWe'll get to that and a few minutes I wait wait name became well known here in the west after he was targeted by the Chinese government for his activism before that he was working in relative obscurity in Beijing in the mid nineties and for some years in New York City I look back on those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you talk about the winter then you come to spring here come to summer morning to more pressures of time\nHis new book capture some of those times it's called I weigh Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand and three and several photos he documents the final days of his father I Ching what I'm trying to find as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities after he\nPassed away I feel you feel you're alone and they don't belong to on your body and uh\nAnd maybe that's the moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically prepared and for me to become a new boss for myself or new boss of yourself yes just like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us the story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that defense should really\nThe Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that defense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society I recently have clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nThen even he was the same generation is on the state leaders Chairman Mao drawn I on the people they weren't together but uh but he was heavily criticized us or writers in some way against the party\nSo your father wasn't that inner circle with now\nOh yeah yeah they're really core which is supported the ruble ocean or part of the ... late to of course he'd being\nKicked out or from a party has untied revolution and uh spend about two years so yeah I well not just allowed to ride towards his name's totally disappeared in the public memorial how did that memorial first they decided to\nHis body has to be covered by communist flack is very high honor and that means you're you're part of it is a revolution but I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not\nDo something to somebody already passed away which you know it's me against his will so I made that argument and I said we don't need covers out the flack did they resist ... yeah they they told me they said to your father\nDoesn't just beyond your family you know which is very good argument they say a recent belongs to the Communist Party or state was it a convincing arguments oh no it's not it's a ... for me and say insulting to some mind now and has suffered so much\nThat they are being covered by that piece of red blood on kids with this Hummer and how to conduct sickle said cool yeah I'm All right\nIf it's brutal hurts me and then there were the flowers\nFlower as this kind of ceremony the I'll use the same sense of a paper flowers you know if someone used then the next day a week later somebody dies me oh yeah yeah yeah same I won't walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use an isn't being used before\nSo they say what they're going to do after that we'll buy\nFresh ours my father's point his artists you know he he lived ... much relate to the highest static judgment on the moral judgment\nSo I said I have to change it so they send out a A R people the ball out all the ... forest in Beijing city\nWow I Know they made a fresh for that so he can sleep in the middle but still covered by this ride but on kids\nWhile your father was ill you did this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smashed teaching dynasty porcelain and a ... dynasty earned and your photographs smashing another on how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying\nJust not really much idea is is really attribute or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action you see ... to that kind of ... and all the time\nWas your intention to shake up the Chinese public\nKnow was not possible you'll have no path for the rest of society is in deep sleep and they don't care\nIt was interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing a finger\nAt the Hong Kong's skyline appointing middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger\nJust just so sad to survey about him king age I now I realize that don't do that anymore because I may grow older you know and the U.S individual in this society what else can you do I mean he's just give out a opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't really sinks outweigh you know on the surface of the shallow surveys yes us are defending individual rights are human rights\nBut deeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as you were removed\nTo the same with the reality is about how you you as a nation still have a power to accept the

eleven thousand years or so ago and that material in the ... is that old like it it made out of material from find that used to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to

when ... says the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the like I don't know if the freezer and let's start she saw\nAnd so then one from a forest it starts to truly thought than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because migrants are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing\nBasically and then they emit carbon micro breasts that we have to worry about basically [laughter]\nMicrobes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn of a basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere at ... or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes

level traps on this lake and a bunch more nearby\nThey check all of them multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular conditions groups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon bookstores here from ... we're trying to figure that out [noise]\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never warm the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective wearing what climate scientists call a new analog situation a massive global experiment\nThere's not that we turn on the uptick Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop turning up\n[noise] [noise]\nIf you have warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to salt and that is something that scientists are really worried about because there are many a threshold sleep you might cross their ah\n... says that in many parts of the Arctic the permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that to the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something

about how much it will just if you had to pull up there it's cute but\nBut it's also about like us surviving as a species because if it gets much warmer like the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we like the food we eat\nAnd where we live is just not adapted to that\nDon't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point scientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which means could release it more carbon in the process just built on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at that once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processors we can't control and it will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilization\nI ask your team and he thought there was any way to stop the six minutes we're conducting on the Arctic or if he's not the damage was already done and now
