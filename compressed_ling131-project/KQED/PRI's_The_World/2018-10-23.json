at three o'clock\nI'm Mark a woman and misses the world\nIt is a huge number of people are walking together five to seven thousand migrants across the board of this week from Guatemala into southern Mexico from here in the u._s. it's become a political issue ahead of the midterms President Trump strikes a conspiratorial tone when he says hardened criminals and middle Easterners are heading toward the U.S\nThose claims have no evidence by the way\nThe Mexican government is handling the situation as a humanitarian one Danielle ... is a former spokesman in President Enrique opinion yet the government he's now a political consultant\nBeyond says Mexican Government is currently walking a tightrope\nOn the one hand you have your ally and your biggest partner putting pressure on you\nAnd also recruit and I think the fact that you need to protect your own borders and you're you're only allowed\nBut on the other hand there's like the whole movement in the public opinion of Mexico saying guys we should treat the Central Americans as we require the American roots are Mike Rounds up on the north\n[noise] what about right now we're seeing Mexican police in riot gear some of them look like they're ready to go to battle what rights to the Mexican immigration laws give the migrants right now we're traveling through the country\nLook that for decades Mexico I'm southern border has been very ...\nMeaning that we have like four years ... thousands of immigrants from South in front of America traveling from Mexico\nWe have heavily invested in the country now we're southern border there to provide more facilities for new crossing and to provide humanitarian besides for those probably to the north\nAnd yet Mexican police fired tear gas at some of the migrants enclosed a border did you see that as a serious effort or just for\nWhat I see is that Mexican police work or not they were having the shield sound and the guy said but they were not carrying guns because that was the limit they said like\nGossip but they were not occurring ... because that was the limit they said like they didn't want ... loose flushes\nSo the Mexican police had no live ammunition could Mexican police and security stop the migrants if they want it to her they force them back south\nThey could do that my guess is that the Mexican authorities do with ... with them in order for them to apply for human ... besides\nThe know how do you think most Mexicans view the Central Americans passing through Mexico right now or are they welcoming them would they accept them if they were just stay\nOn the one hand you see that a lot of people like going to be poor even working class people try to cook the immigrants providing them with\nFood should there what are we supposed to be not throw their own country for decades we word of the country that receive so many European particular\n... fleeing from CBS wires um work too but you still see some sectors in the ... the seeing these people are coming to steal our jobs\nFor Mexico is not so easy just to ignore or scrapped\nThe U.S points of view in this issue\nWe are going through the are heavily dependent upon each other Fifteen hundred billion dollars per year for a boy and the other hand Mexican Puerto Rico premiums they are not happy with the fact of the government just taking orders from another government ... so the Mexican government taking\nOrders from the White House in Washington is ... is a political consultant in Mexico city he's also a former spokesman in the government of president Enrique Pena Nieto Danielle thank you for your time\nHappy to talk to you Michael\nYesterday President Trump announced that he would make cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador they've been receiving this age twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent than twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars in financial assistance to the region\nWe wanted to know what that eight actually goes to\nSarah appears is with the migration Policy Institute in Washington so what has his aid been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nTo use for a wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the northern triangle country is the alliance for prosperity this is a program that arose out of a separate migration crisis that we had in two dozen fourteen when a lot of company in child migrants arrived at our southern border\nPresident Obama at that time and knowledge that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root cause and and look at what's going on in these home countries to cause people to to free and and really have this mass exodus\n... alliance for posterity is designed to increase economic prosperity and those countries and strengthen institutions they consider it a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to to end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador Ken the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress just slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but now he cannot do that you know out early and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to add to end it to these countries he'd really need to wait until they come back in session after November\nAnd Sarah how political do see this move being is it something that Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran immigration he saw that issue when Hindi election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms\nSo this caravan effectively as a political gas to him and Republicans in that they can play this out they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country quote unquote from this cat and\nA Trump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle country and Mexico as well are are doing a good job and trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we had a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think well it will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a friend like that\nWhat is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those are friends to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for certain reference to the asylum system including changing is island for individuals who are applying at our border like this caravan so that and it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the care of and apply for asylum\nThey'll likely be placed in our immigration clerk backlog which
