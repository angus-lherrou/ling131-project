and injustice that my dad died at\nReporter and you know the economy in Mexico city wrote about ... he bought a remarkable advocate for women's soccer in Mexico mysteriously and brutally murdered Nina thank you very much for telling us about motivator no problem thank Cape\nIt's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel the mystery of Saudi journalist ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... for the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than than it would be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to shell is to you\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis\nArms in security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for us you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\nWell it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some deals are made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said or the other day as well\nYou know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory or things are built that are being sold to the Saudis it's a different matter but it's for\nOur economy as a whole it's certainly not much I'm certainly not a reason to murderous regime that's not only kill the journalist is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saudi contracts with Boeing and raise the on you're saying that this contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nThere was a big year in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in\nA couple of packages so not all of us have gone through but at Fifteen fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions of dollars some of that money is already slowed them started delivering the fifteenth so the\nMoney is water under the bridge since already been spent we're not going to see it again that would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need new systems so what's actually on the table that might change is the deal for a missile defense system called fab\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and they have to agree on the details so in theory the stars could say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia's whole military is built on us in UK supplied weapons communications maintenance spare parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much of that is relying on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy and not all that as weapons and then the Saudi peace has a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say\nSo it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb has built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump\nSponsorship as the cake you eat the life's dream bike Kennedy from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X Kennedy on demand\nGoods and how much of that is reliant on Saudi Arabia well everything the\nPentagon spends accounts for about three percent of our entire economy and not all that as weapons and then the Saudi peace is a tiny fraction of that less than a tens of percent I Would say\nSo it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb is built on a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know what President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up I think partly he\nLikes to show up and sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people and the American worker you can see that as trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crime was Saturday regime because he wants to team up with them or in going after Iran\nBut all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches in schools it was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states\nAlaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah trap island\nSo this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes at a forces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department she set out to get federal agencies to help protect people and coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid\nTension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states\nAlaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah check violent\nSo this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department he set out to get federal agencies to help protect people in coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change ... and other towns were already engaged in planning your own solutions but the sticking point with money\nMoving a whole town is a complicated inexpensive affair one federal study pay the cost of living ... a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd ... doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept the human caused climate change is even real\nThe finding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some grant money some grant program spun up but uh boy it's just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the burying sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change\nClimate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ... and he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because ... you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory a factor in the course or I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperiled anything that has a with climate change to it has to stop\nThen a few months later Clement got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned I realized that it was that I was part of the purge\nClimate found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should the state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll just saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there\nAre in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's going to happen and the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on her own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great\n[noise]\nI reach out twice to the department of the interior for comment but they did not respond\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is why don't people just leave ... ... if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents just go somewhere else known are fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's a cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them to just assimilate into another village somewhere a is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which I guess it was horrible [noise]\nEveryone I met in ... seemed to agree on this they want to stay together people here depend on subsistence hunting to feed their families and that food is shared with elders and others who can't go out and hunt\nIn fact people insured rough rely on each other for all of the essentials of life they visit each other when they're sick they take care of each other's kids and they know that their future\nDepends on keeping those relationships intact\nBlow to affect your Dick or or or can we do for an hour or so laugh you know such a way I feel\nThis is Stan Lee

look at our own problems you know\n... is a case study in how climate change can be understood in isolation from history and politics\nThis community is where it is in large part because outside institutions wanted to exert control over these people and their way of life the United states government was very effective when I wanted to make people settle in this particular place but it's so
