native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes down it was a religion that was growing around the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried

centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization\nFollow it up with one more wrong and white fees on pained and I came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between colonists and indigenous people in the new

film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... Brown's Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen language has never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pitches the book he says something like this book\nAnd and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee whereas the culture and civilization if the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty in the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope by reading my book\nYou'll understand why I I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silence than done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found during my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point we did and he was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realize and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist well then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with a Caucasian and having this this land nearby off of the following trading real purchased subtlety traveling for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of do from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nThis is we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock\nMy own personal view is that the takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means\nWho was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon [laughter]\nYes I mean they'd hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present to the government\nThey wanted to be of any new fares to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing and timber and mineral lease is among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the ... trashed the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank car Luigi one of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or ... it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join a caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice that is right\nIn Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the kind that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI

up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German the Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military build up everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village
