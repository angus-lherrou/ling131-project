GBH has spent a year looking deeply at out all this has impacted people all around the world they're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week\nWe want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nGave it any patriotic phone on line said sponsoring him and his men hiring men paying ten rebate\n... nation that just change democracy and we're allies are prowling [noise]\nWay life actually\nFront lines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming by James thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much did they interact with each other by the up\nWhile it's remarkable the story Facebook and Southeast Asia is amazing and that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia to Philippines and demand are other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a the the woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of their their their digital lives\nSo Maria Russia we just heard from we'll hear more from her in a moment um we've reported on the store that\nAnd it on the story that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually led to the violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo what happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to deter today a during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power the platform helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively\nAnd as Maria wrestle reports after he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and paid followers that were just sending all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\nSo a ... a ... this activist and she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dark here's an exchange between new James and rigorous oh\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting [noise]\nNo\nI think one day and they were focused on what they didn't realize is that countries like China [noise] continuously institutions are ruptured his friends [laughter] [laughter] you don't have to see\nWhen you bring everyone onto him not informed and junior high any kind of rules if you don't implement those rules for getting wind and chaos\nSo James what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts\nBut as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly recently and as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain rearrested organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled in the problem there\nDoes that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole\nI think that that there are fact checking project that they're trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country on in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinated about it is that\nWhere your rent restaurant runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question which you raise several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns weather is just information\nFake news hate speech uh what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at ... you know age ... for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what the standard for success here because there is no ability for us to audit them were really left in the position of having to take their word for it\nAnd whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know\nBut as a ... that this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your dog and it's really it was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement I'm Talking about that have been ... where that is most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know that the horrific events here of the past week\nAnd scenes that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media\nPolarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world years that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it\nI I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what date of their collective Iran you um but ah it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who is in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I

strong Israel so and Ron dreamers comments I think my American Jews or they do Israeli Jews\nDidn't tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI'm over all although there has been expressions of condolence inexpensive shocking at heart [noise] ... did you kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact of a pat on the American Jewish community\nThey don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand or American Juniors it's been a guy is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school\nWhere they hide and I did like you know hiding out for computer school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feeling my share story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from\nShare story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most of the story of Jerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that when he was shot\nAnd and after the moral in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream orders hottest which is a Jewish prayer memorializing\nThe dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up to the ... and that is traditionally a time and only those were morning actually stand up and when asked why does he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day there will be nobody stand for me so I stand\nFor all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing up and sending out together is such a metaphor and I think overall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a cynic I shouldn't Jewish community because they had their just unity\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among the child that they find it in the world at a synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't can act\nDo you know the president does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker here\n[noise] me think um [noise] that American Jews and Israelis are two very different paths right now to American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves during much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate\nThis repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant would you be kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt\nAnd so there's this very strong desire to know that you know American Jews have done fairly well for themselves in in America\nI'm and feel fairly successful until very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lead them to sort of be more liberal and more open where is it rarely do you still feel under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product that sort of post traumatic her Holocaust world where they look at things very much in this sort of there are some game it time you know a person than whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know I'm fresh from and somehow an Israeli the trend towards that it's like circling the wagons in\nFear and American jury and

light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking jets to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon\nAnd she was able to tell the story of coral and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an icon of closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class in a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of corals very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate\nThe heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly she was an iconoclastic terms that's the way she approached science she\nJust slight pushing your colleagues
