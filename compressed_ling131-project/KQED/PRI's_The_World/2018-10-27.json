San Francisco cake you we I north highland Sacramento where I live on line that he can weed out or\nIt's too bad here before we start today show is going to let you know that this episode contains descriptions of violence and sexual violence\nAnd it is probably not suitable for young children so if you've got young children in the room or if you're not feeling up for it just be one way you're\n\nListening to radio lab [noise]\nRadio from I mean there'll be you and why [noise]\n\nThree two one hey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\nWe have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away they it's gets under your skin this is Lisa learning I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin or he also seems to have got\nYeah it it just made me not\nKnow whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nShirking Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist one newspaper guy for the post aren't Glenn falls\nHe's been reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping out around X pulled off the road a aside rode out through thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they signed up for this middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing and sunny circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees and he started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of\nCourse we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied\nSo after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski on\nBecause the other three kids were spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening\nBut they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they hurt filled the voice\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him what\nWas happening with the man stabbing them ... with his back and I\nHad been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nButton demand caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter about an hour the men come\nMen that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than a killer and feeding it laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the demand screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and not just began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see\nThe manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by there was the scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower and through a roving for trolls men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifle shotgun bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they have two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the words they\nEssentially find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID eight\nSeven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis scale senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for\nSponsorship of the cake you eat do you live stream by expanding the firm Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices in the home\nAnd the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when the people got panicked when you're all are well one of the doors are large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't figure it out last night and the day before they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says the man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food in those drinks to survive\nDay after day the man hot it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follower lead that he had stolen a car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on them\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named Taylor block spotted gal\nThese freeze or\nDrop your gun something to that effect and Guerra started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back the arm in the front Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw Darrow and he was laying down in the mud not moving\nAnd so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nThey you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story\nThat I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor at least ... is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation and we are recording\nThis other guy at the center of this conflict was\nA man named Frank our money Frank H army and brand the lawyer in Syracuse\nThey never know how to pronounce it or money or or in a way that Mary Armani Frank's wife and solve it they use that money but it is or money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York that's our money now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well we're just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk away\nIt was a fighter I liked ... fights this is cool fights like standing up for the little guy\nAnd that's partly why he became an attorney\nWhen you're fighting a cage for defended you're fighting this date and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he has well respected\nHad a good reputation but then he met rather\nGuerra yeah last year strong to take him out you need a forty five and a or to head the field I mean this guy is dangerous you know love of the things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented in at first on two pretty small things wind won\nA schoolteacher headless self does his child he was sued the school\nAnd I talk to them a little bit and then the head on on a movie I actually I represent 'em that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\nWe kept picture for [noise] um let's see some younger kids two\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went off the back door took of\nDriving the lady friends car to try to lose too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this may be as far as\nWe can walk\nTo this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and towns supervisor of Mariah Tom ... father says it's on a road that goes to the mine it or what is clear to them on [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road to visit\nTrails around or you're just\nA very icy that day the share this used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly teeth are no leaves and all the trees were\nI'm very skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they came in here so\nRight up there so here we are in our son do suits Ruggles trudging choose for is looking for\n[noise]\nBut we're looking [noise]\nWe've found is when\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you carefully this has given me such yeah we don't want to fly down there and so\nThey couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft\nHe's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nOr you could see your sneak the shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd like I said to myself system which does it end he yells back up to algae kept me out of your\nMoney back up do\nEventually they'll gee found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where they had said he left but our money wasn't there when ... founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option what we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThings are missing kids were the only ones who know you know should\nSponsorship as the cake you weedy life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X Kennedy on demand\nYou just can't we took an oath to keep fit confidence is over ... under the\nCurrent rules which have developed quite a bit since the time this happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nUnder the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened waking up even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if\nPeople are already dead then you ... the the lawyers\n... that's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is it to play the part of the system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates them even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fight as hard as they can for their clients the\nLawyer is the agent of his client only only the agent of\nOr also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right if we each year building on on the side of tell just tell\nTell of course yes and I knew Mr ... from ... to his his du da da da da da da da da da da da and they knew him from church June\nOne if you have to be and then a few\nDegrees shoes the parents of the family and your do you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\nSo now what does he [noise] coming up that hard to get even harder [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nHi this is already from Arlington, Texas radioactive supported in part by the Alfred P sunshine Asian enhancing public understanding of science and technology and the modern Ron marred for makes you not fly WWW dot ... dot O.

I'm rubber ... which is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer bena feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing\nThey knew the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and uh no I don't know what is it what what's their next move well\nSo they decided to leave a plea bargain they take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some case yes and\nIn exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients to get get into a mental hospital instead of a Christian also right away they're going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give it a little and you're gonna take it a little\nThat's kind of gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information and the person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way it's\nHe doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so her for a gym Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Andrew McCabe investigator from the state police detective located in the district attorney armies office and when they met army and bell gee search the briefcase us up to be a and the best the gator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap for some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love these\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't think I was here or there was a lawyer to do this job\nA ... I was a good lawyer ...\nArt everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and Dell gee did a good body is case ties law schools across the country everybody teachers\nSponsorship advocate you where do you live stream by extending the firm Comcast extremity Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home it's like a touchstone\nWhat a people thing what if what if what if people say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York and it's being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp and I agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you and in sitting in on these classes\nAnd in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely because professors can point to where they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n... ...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victim\nAnd she initially didn't want to\nGo on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record okay All right yeah\nSo I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machine camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and don't you found in the mind you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings are talking about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nAre 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd the the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the ... that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there\nSitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and that is why did they taught and a lot of schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students\nThere um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm skills I I get it and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't know I guess\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of um sounds sounds I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that does not have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive heard they're great pets too much weight I we we can go and pick it up at Boston University really\nDifficult for us and and Danny what's your boyfriend had that's just that summer and he had a full scholarship any uh graduated just before\nToo and I'm sure other children get\nGreat future ahead of them\nIt's just a horrible tragedy [laughter]\n\n[laughter] it's a horrible you know to be in the freezer shooting\n[noise] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter no we're what excuses for protecting the person that killed her no justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's where it is [noise]\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's OK\n\n\nOkay can you hear the echoes the dogs don't amount and things tend to travel up the hill kind of bounce around water I think it's\nSome deeper down in their coffee and I can't tell whereas stripping everything up here it's frozen solid some truth that is [noise]\nBut I think I'm going to turn back around [laughter]",
