John Bolton Trump's national security advisor because he's reputed to throw his weight around and he's got strong views of the UN to boot how well did he and he would get along\nMy understanding is that he certainly exerted more as an influence he is a former U.S ambassador to the United nations and said this has somewhat of a pet issue for him\nAnd during his tenure and he was famous or rather perhaps infamous for his dislike of the un and his skepticism of multilateral it's I'm more generally\nYou said her clout had been on the decline it can you elaborate a little bit more on that\nDuring the early months of the Trump Administration Nikki Haley was really willing to push U.S policy in areas particularly concerning Russia\nAnd Ukraine from her perch at the un and she was able to do that because there was a vacuum as Tillerson declined to engage with both allies and adversaries alike\nAnd ... secretary on pale moved over from the CIA he has been much more willing to fill that

industry achieve the goal they've been fighting for for a long time getting their employers to do more to protect them from sexual assault\nThis made headlines a few years back when a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss Kahn the former head of the IMF of sexual assault that case was settled out of court but the problem never went away here's the world's Alison at at a\nImagined is you're a woman working in an office and you're in the middle of the meeting all of a sudden your meal coworker starts to address it's hard to imagine that happening right well if you're a hotel housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not three times and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm going to put my key and I'm going to in the room so this particular time you know I'm not an to determine does get standing there completely ...\nThat's ... she's a housekeeper at a large hotel in Chicago she asked me not to use her last name or the name of the hotel where she works she's worried about how speaking out my impact her job she says that when this happened she was more than just scared\nLike it just it made me feel disgusted angry so I just kinda like bad just left\nShe recorded a tour manager but she says nothing was done\nSo it's one of those things happen so much in housekeeping where your manager kinda feel like it was just a normal and they just say okay you don't go back to the runs a day\nBut she did have to go back she brought another woman so she wouldn't have to be alone and fortunately that gas wasn't there but he wasn't asked to leave so twenty sixteen when members of her union\nSo in twenty sixteen when members of her union UNITE HERE wanted to ask her and her co workers some questions about sexual assault on the job she knew this was your chance to make change happen\nI'm like oh okay and one of my coworkers within the next ... and she's like you know just kind of knows me like you know they come and talking about sexual harassment and I'm I'm like this is our opportunity to kind of share things that we deal with every day\nWith Tony and other housekeepers in the union set out to survey more than five hundred women about their experiences on the job nearly sixty percent of women they talked with dealt with some form of assault by hotel guest that lead to action last year\nHousekeepers in Chicago successfully lobbied for device to keep them safe it's called the panic button\nAnd it was part of a city wide campaign known as a hands off pants on so this is one solution\nIt did send a message that I was in danger newsroom\nThat there'll be ... she's the head of housekeeping at the Witte hotel she shows me how the safety device works press the button and hotel security is on the way housekeeping who emigrated here in the nineties from what was then Yugoslavia she's always worked as a housekeeper\nHer story is not uncommon according to a study done by the American immigration council the top occupation for foreign born women here in the U.S is housekeeping was nearly nine hundred thousand women working in this sector\nFor ... having the panic button has made her and her staff safer I honestly think is a great think it is for the Chicago hotels are required to give this device to housekeepers but sexual assault in hotel industry is a global issue so what are some of these larger chains like Mary on\nTuned to keep their workers safe say in Paris or Dubai there's such heightened\nAwareness around safety and security so we're dialing up in this space but I think it's important to remember there is no one magic answer\nThat's Erica Alexander she's the chief lodging services officer from Marriott International she's talking about the new devices they're rolling out in the U.S and Canada but the company has no current plans to put panic buttons into the hands of their workers in other countries\nThat are a huge problem because we understand that you know Mariette brand should be doing the right thing whether they're here in the United states around the world\nThat's Cathy find gold she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers from Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working in South Africa and around the globe to push for hands off pants on campaign\nThat practice that's happening here in the United states and Mary I can do it here in the United states they can do it in China where they had a massive investment and they can do it throughout Asia throughout Latin America\nBefore the me too movement last year housekeepers like Tony I didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety on the job [noise] they've been trying for years to get their employers to protect them\nAnd then all of a sudden all of this stuff started showing up in the news and I'm just like this is incredible on my book could do like we we all had to say like we've started something\nAnd they have five of the major hotel chains have promised to install panic buttons in older hotels nationwide by twenty twenty but for so many people around the globe working as housekeepers there's no button that can press to stop them from being assaulted on the job\nFor the world I was in the head of Chicago [noise]\nPay enough already with the phone scams
