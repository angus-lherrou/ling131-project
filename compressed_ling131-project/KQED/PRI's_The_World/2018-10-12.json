anti missile interceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing\nWow so so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that basically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are\nOnly for high level hackers to take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into system some of these things were just that they found be fault passwords hadn't

world that new trade agreement that the U.S Mexico and Canada recently agreed on well it covers a wide range of issues but if you listen to President Trump you might think it all boils down to one thing dairy products from Canada\nThey've treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York state that a lot of other states\nVery badly the new trade deals still needs legislative approval but it would give us dairy farmers more access to Canadian markets their worlds Jason Margolis went to Ontario to hear from farmers there\n\nPhilip Armstrong's family has been farming in ... Ontario for a very long time\nOr family has been on this piece of land um since Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has lost a lot since then it's also made huge leaps Armstrong graduating college thirty seven years ago today each of his three hundred and eighty cows where's the high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk in the computer measures they're out for\nThe cold or if they have on them says id but it's also measures eating habits ordered it measures for room in the stomach flu which to make sure that that's going well [noise] it measures are lying down time and measures are activists\nCombined that technology with better breeding and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago\nThis might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management\nEach floor has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system\nMatch supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent\nThat's what's enraged President Trump Canada does what in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much but that's Rosen in income or giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the facts at all no and so if we were hurting their dairy farmers will Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got in just had that we were mistreating their farmers\nAnd many American dairy farmers agreed with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently read to find some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada far from it they've been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices\nPeople are also consuming less milk a lot of male cat in the past\nHas been dumped because it couldn't be processed in an appropriate time or sold and extreme discount\nBrian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin well us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture\nWe have no right to do that I I really think we're on the nice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system gold\nSays I think that the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system the U. S. government's sets a minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies\nUs also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour cream for instance it so I think it's I don't remember exactly as like grandma Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount\nThe U.S Eric ... is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us tariffs on other cheeses and now you have like fifty percent terrorists Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important state to the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carry Trump became a political lately wrong and that is what started the whole process\nBack on the farm fill up arms for the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers for producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada to make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what was happening his or her a fear but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it all\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York former see things differently they're glad to have more access to a Canadian\nMarkets still there is an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers in organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis ...

Mike him she lives outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists\nOr even just simple critics of what's going on Saudi Arabia for the past few years have been put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and search amount of the highest profile of something that's been going on inside tied to radio for more than a year now let's say and that would get anything\nAs far as I tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting carrots and so this shows a lack of understanding of the government itself of what is independent truckers because there isn't anything called independent journalism in Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film\nThere were like how would you like to be identified or you I thought he did it and it's like no I'm a journalist covering a story but because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can take these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space\nAnd this is the problem with with with how the Saudi Government appealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even the my oldest\nOf commenting critique about their policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly cover stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman came I Can't lose\nHer absolutely on everyone I mean like ... before you could be a

watching a live stream you could see that they were joking about kind of violently and there was some kind of break up and up flight and that initiated the emergency abort sequence and the capsule that they were writing on performed what's known as a ballistic reentry and that's when you come in at much steeper angle when you land on earth\nSo I think they experienced nearly seven genes which is seven times earth gravity so pretty intense flight um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and I believe there are about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that dates\nWeren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that the experience to nominate weightless most which are not nice yelling at that part of the flight and I think that had to deal with the fact that there were no longer with the booster and then at that point they start spending and the goal is to a grand jury and then they're parachutes deployed to slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the earth or\nYeah they are [laughter] God I've done what is now the parabolic\nFlight that when you see a weightlessness for a moment in time and during the ... experience extra genes and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a natural I didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier\nThat's what they were feeling and it can be pretty important\nAre there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if they've traced\nThe exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separations so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core\nAnd they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters ... and our core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely just won the ... of this particular sways rocket though it's been around for decades [laughter]\nI don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\n[noise] none of us and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics enter now it definitely creeps into other\nAspects when Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has\nHad an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to announce that we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at the moment because the soil is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not bad rash outlet geopolitics getting away with that\nIs significant setback for the international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the nation's she church we currently have three astronauts into orbit on the station\nAnd they're going to have to come home eventually they got up there and it's the way it is as well and the capitals can't last forever and or but they have a two hundred or the whole day lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into that\nSo they are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down scene or Russia could possibly launch an empty phrase capital and send that up to the station and get an extra two hundred gauge to stay on board\nBut that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren ... is senior science reporter for the verge\nThanks Lawrence thanks for having me\nThis next story is also about Russia but guess what it has
