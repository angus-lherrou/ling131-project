I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise] they're\nGonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times\nWe've had on the show before than say something Hi [laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah certainly getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown's shooting in Ferguson and\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an armed African American teenager was shot and killed when I became a national\nThere was a lot of belly aching and press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics\nOn police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings and it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nMayor rice and Harris than than John become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police for an itself in the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many\nPerson actually there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement\nBut I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete yeah because most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something\nThat's unprecedented so versed study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records lawsuit\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places in South bend sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida I think\nThree hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not this involves a year of work the\nCounty police department is getting lawyers involved is is a massive saying that involve probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nNicer been put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know for sure that\nA lot about we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh is this summer here to check it out\nYeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county\nBook or a Tom boy and beach uh all\nThrough the alphabet basically his has a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers and spread across the entire ...\nThere's a combination of ah use the force reports civil court records and media clippings they represent a eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting and the state of Florida and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo he did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect police chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer or officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these are the how how we can come out of the data and build it\nLet's like learn from these with the how how we can come out of the data and build a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some\nConclusions from lessens some solutions\nDidn't all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will last link to\nIt from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend hopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the number of states that he about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that\nAbout a third of the police shooting case it involves someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking the gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence of the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill maybe off their meds\nAt the time of the shooting in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cops which is where somebody who is usually a mental Leo barely trying to get them so shocked intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to shoot ...\nThis is something that people will cover police apparently know quite well you know\nDid a news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country [noise] but when it got to bench central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's\nNot forty percent it's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nStuff themselves much right now but the breakdown between fatalities for those same demographics and it's we sat there going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying firearms nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you\nVery foreign percent six hundred percent he says one percent or more here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the proper\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to where we were in why we want to start\nThis mass of still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know they're all written in this ah supplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call and this is the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony styles\nArmed with a knife at apartment to fight every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table that the investigation of the death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders stock to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and Ben traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories\nUs is reaching out wherever I told them\nSomething happened in you know here in Florida\nIn the club that nobody really wants to be\nFamily's more than just\nOr so after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the moms they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys do you have every every event or a no no I just wanted to know the ones on there and has been telling everyone about\nThis ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but figure this must be part of your different types of learning as part of just hoping dream right right we all just simply trying to find a way it was official gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point because it was talking to two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a\nLike a like you say some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really goes on in my house she says his age comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christmas [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen\nCooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories creeks of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nYou\nKnow the night before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\nGive us some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we starting to stay over eight inches of how we see each other bad on each of cows to know a metric it becomes like a huge sleep over\nAnd the first one is the crap talking you know getting to know each other a motel or the vice over shows results like therapy for\nVicki let in the past but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women just really stuck with me I Believe or add I'm studying on them promise to win crystal\nLet some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars [noise]\nAbout twelve people have in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were\nWho had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nBut we usually the video that we can we just came out on video that\nMy house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police caught attained behind him was probably right here and then the officer say they hid 'em came in\nAnd then we come on\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call execution and the vegetables are close to the guardian was the investigators\nAnd all that\nBut I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back after all you can smell what's right and so now like when you play any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just\nYou get ... percent\nInterest brings you right back here mhm yep in the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\n\nBecause I started ... some of the other one that started to cry\n[noise]\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find the best model what about the phone let me a couple of women had to be their phone man\n[noise]\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just scared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars\nOf all I just want to thank you for just scaring us out with us but I Know [noise] it\nI mean we have we haven't been I have\nIt was a very ... we saw that last week\nAnd I sort of like in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember at the end I used to tell you how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nOff\nMy visit home I have to go there all the time of course yeah that would force how could you not\nAnd you know what you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh [laughter] sit there yeah and it's crazy because like if a listen if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about as like a certain time every\nDay and a little white man we share\nEverything like that are like he literally I think he does he liked to have lunch with every day my dad would be I don't know if you're a Democrat in way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that always sit down and\nHe take his idea of a whole new\nI Know the number [noise]\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can either be deal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother I watched\nAs my daughter was loaded into the ground\nAnd it was around that time that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nKind of felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment\n\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time

[noise]\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the nights out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over and then\nShe became central four cups and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nOfficer oh say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot I wanted to show your best shot I think you want to die I Want to have you on a guy you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody\nTo know the police votes can't kill\nHang hang on one of our counseling on T.\nV. to pick them up and walk them over to the squad car for the man\nAnd the UN's huh\nSo this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge establishment yeah you have to resort to deadly force right away\nThat when I mean yeah you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... hey hey hey this is important because there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deployment Asia and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek Derek Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finished watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight go through the neighborhood if you mind me asking on the front step waves of hatred what are you doing man Derek does stupid son of a bitch you don't have close to being that wouldn't be backwards mitigation wasn't doing drugs and he was as we as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say ... primary election among the big winners they told him he just he is now ... county sheriff Mike Schmidt would was elected sheriff of\nLinn county [noise] friendly\nWhich the county that big tone of each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with long his organization called her\nWhich decreased executive research forum big coalition of police chiefs and twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being some being law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life\nNot just a month after ... put out this principle two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between Iran and stations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have I have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing way policing is done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and that's what I thought the same way too but\n[noise] there was this between than I had read realized\nHow far [noise]\nHope has to go\n\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to\nThis is Ryan person
