Washington I'm Kimberly Adams for marketplace [noise]\nThis is gonna sound a little cynical and I suppose in a way it is but that doesn't make it not true\nKids and I'm Talking really young kids who are or a market there are markets it can be catered to the content can be created for and from which profit can be made\nThe corporate example at hand is YouTube and its influence on the youngest of consumers Alexis Madrigal is a staff writer for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by YouTube book on the program thanks for having me to talk to me\nAbout how you came to work on this story\nI have a two year old and a five year old vaccine\nToddler YouTube and I was like what are all of these things are all these brands I'd never heard of these companies all over the world and I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed in this kind of animation that to me looks kind of pre Pixar if you know what I mean\nOh okay good lots to unpack in there because the idea first of all of a toddler YouTube what what is that is it as it sounds\nSo Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know when you're old ... year old three year olds and that's what I call tied to YouTube and it's just kind of like wild\nPlace well [laughter] I I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them off almost as much as adults it kind of see\nThat's who I mean YouTube is by far the most popular brand among children and even little children have their own favorites to one of the biggest brands within the space is called to chew TV yeah they have Nineteen billion views they\nHave twenty nine million subscribers\nThis is a global children's entertainment ... they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back with the the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street in children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all that was to educate not necessarily want a two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that\nThe mission of of toddler YouTube and into two TVs that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they've banned it in her tainted they bend to trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realized that they've done that\nAnd they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producer it's on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube it's good for kids rather than just something that sets up their time\nWell so spit bullet for me do you think that's gonna work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube is doing\nNot really on the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business is obviously much different and the biggest difference is there's just YouTube basically dishes where kids are going\nThis is where the whole businesses and say YouTube itself would have to be the one that sort of maybe tip the scales for educational content within the algorithms that determine what people watch\nWhat do we know what do we think uh it's actually doing it the kids setting aside from it or whatever educational benefit there might have we know what being attached to our phones and our screens does to grownups\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a

switch between those things very quickly maybe sending kids up to back to kind of pacing that's actually not educational and that's kind of the big worry that we've sort of in juice kind of attention
