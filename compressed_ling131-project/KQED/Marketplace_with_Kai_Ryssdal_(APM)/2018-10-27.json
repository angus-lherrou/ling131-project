coastline here is ... and it's mostly populated by the lion you can actually hear them feet lead barking down on the rocks right below the White House [noise]\nThe water's on this stretch of coastline are so treacherous the lots of shipwrecks have happened here even after the White House got built in Eighteen eighty nine [noise]\nThe rocket didn't like how did scientists really isolated surrounded by water\nOn three sides and the first flight housekeepers who came to live here could only get their supplies by ship it took four hours to get here by horseback from Monterrey but for the kids who grow up here the lighthouse keepers and their wives it was such a beautiful place they fell in love with these breathtaking view [noise]\n\nJulie unit is an go on to her and she says a lot of those original residents have come back here in the afterlife because it's so stunningly beautiful\nThis is my ... it's just a beautiful peaceful there's something about this place is so calming\nSo makes sense think us want to come back here or want to be here\nOkay 'cause she's not just a ghost hunter she's actually a volunteer do sit here at the White House and she's the one who recorded that go sleep now she wants you to go home\nShe actually got a collection of these recordings and she said she can often only hear the goes when you're playing the tape back\nA little bit hard to hear but Julie says that's the voice of a former resident named Catherine Ingersoll she was a Danish immigrant and she was married to a lighthouse keeper here and she's apparently telling her daughter who was nicknamed pokey to go up to bet\nJulie says that was recorded inside the house where the lighthouse keepers family to live [noise]\nShe takes me inside that house\nShe not and ask permission in any of the spirits are still around\nIt's Julie ...\nShe's talking to this ghost named Ruth Julie says it roots the spirit still hangs out in the kitchen of the house because she liked to cook\nAs anybody

to tell us this was just a hoagie trick for Halloween because they have decorated the house with which it's hot than fake skeleton yeah\nWait until something to the end the fingers on the fake skeleton hand\nThey actually twitch just slightly\nWell whoever did that thank you can you make the skills in him move again\nThe skeleton hand states still but I Do start hearing this weird buzz in my headphones as I'm recording so Julie steps into how\nCould you stop trying to get energy from the equipment it's affecting their reporting on all you hear of points or would you mind stopping the static\nOn the counter three one two three\nBut the goes don't listen the bugs stays until we leave the building\nYou're probably saying at this point okay all of this is just a gimmick to try to get people to visit the White House\nEven some of the other do since I talk to you do not believe ... goes to that there is one dose and her name is Sheila Frasier and they call her the level headed Canadian she says she used to be a skeptic\nUntil she had her own encounter\nThis was real [noise] this was unbelievable Sheila is the one who volunteers to clean the lighthouse keepers house every Thursday and one morning she was putting away the vacuum when she said she heard something down\n... who was [noise]\nAnd there was nobody but there was a woman and she was right here on this top landings and she was turning century [noise]\nHit her hair or maybe in her late thirties early forties those skirts\nAnd the thing is she was holding something and I couldn't figure out what she was holding she turned into jumped at me and she was gone and she she looked\nLike a real washing bomb yeah absolutely [noise]\nEven if you don't believe in go visiting this life has is really eerie even during the daytime\nIt's got lots of creaky doors [noise]\nWhen she was so strong it can get up to fifty miles an hour to he says at one point\nLighthouse keepers his dog got blown off a cliff survive [noise] now the White House is automated and the last like housekeeper election\n[noise] now the White House is on it and the last like housekeeper last year in Nineteen Seventy four so if you do come for a visit you might be the only person here\nBesides one of the docent and maybe the go\nI'm not totally convinced that Julie is hoping we can talk to some of them using her goose hunting equipment\nSo that's a couple of different machines this is called an all male is\n... ... is a black box and it has a dictionary of like three thousand words and supposedly each word has a different sound frequency that goes can use to talk to humans and it has a kind of mechanical voice box and the minute that we walk into what was the former blacksmith shop\nThat goes dictionary starts walking who's here\nWith us right know Walter Walter what the hell at this point I Am thoroughly freaked out\nThere doing the radio show and they like to interview you alter when did you like to be on

to set I Am pretty relieved to be getting back to highway one I Am not sure I could handle walking through the spooky points are light house at night\n\nAnd now for a bit of food history [noise]\nIf you ever sat down to its steaming bowl of chips he now you know that\nReally ... do you might have felt transported to a small town\nIn Italy but you'd be wrong\nRight around the time that Mary Ellen pleasant died and the first lighthouse keepers were moving into points or ... you know was\nConcocted right here in California you have to come to San Francisco teach people and you should come to the

to talk to someone from the health department at first I called [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI mean when I learned I showed up at their offices again and again\nThe problem is I mean I've been to the office many times now in person and also called\nIn the finally I tracked down the assistant secretary of health Dr Concepcion can notice long ago\nWe meet in the hallway of the convention center where she's speaking at a press conference about a new lunch program and just like the doctor said she's quick to give me the government's official line ... that the crisis is over\nSo far we are not defecting Neal cases\nI think that on our faith epidemiology [noise] they'll son expect to have cases right now\nI asked her why the health department had stopped testing pregnant women physique up this is what every doctor I spoke to told me she says that's not true that the health department is performing the tests and has been just a few weeks after the hurricane\nAfter ... we try to make sure ah samples collected all over the line where ... percent level that thirty in the mental health and I'm like what does he go on these ah samples where sent\nSamples where sent\nTo see you see that what I thought you see in the states because our lab would have thought ... was damaged\nI checked with the CDC and they told me that never happened the health department never since ... samples

she blames the doctors for dropping the ball their patients in rabbit or um we don't have that close contact with them to make sure they don't ... they should um\nDon't you can also tell me that women tend to be tested but I found out later that testing is no longer free women now have to pay one hundred dollars and the other thing is last year the government said the crisis was over so why would a woman even after the task [laughter]\n\nAnd then I asked for something else when we'll all that data on developmental delays and seek a baby's be released\nI think uh there will be some information released\nThis is the kind of answer I get from doctor can own a gun almost everything we talk about she is hard to pin down and by the end of the conversation she tells me that she needs to get permission from her boss the health secretary before she can share any more details\nIt's not that I got to talk to anybody openly without being authorized because we want to have\nThe correct message\n\nAfter we part ways I'm left standing in that convention center hallway and what starts to become clear to me is that the health department doesn't want to talk about the ... with me or even their own top secret doctors federal doctor told me they stopped hearing from the health department altogether\n\n\nAnd not violent doctors like Carmen ... and Cynthia Garcia started wondering why why was it so important for the government to make you could go away ... says he says they think it comes down to money\nThere's no question you know then the ... that make the notion of having a cigar by
