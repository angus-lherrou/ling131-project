Minnesota I think the main too you know and Maine and you know right choice voting intriguing idea and I think the results there are also a bit mixed\nAnd deserved further analysis I did not think there's a magic bullet I think the most fundamental\nFor how that could be done this or the example of trial and error I don't think there is a kind of a magic play book there have been a variety of efforts geared to this ah I think the open primary and California is one that many of us are watching closely I think the results so far I've been mixed\nThere are suggestions about creating more of a kind of runoff system you've heard right choice voting as a possibility is being tried in Minnesota\nI think the main too you know and Maine and you know right choice voting intriguing idea and I think the results there are also a bit mixed\nAnd deserved further analysis I Do not think there's a magic bullet I think the most fundamental thing is to engage the majority of Americans when you have about half the country sitting out presidential elections\nAnd two thirds of the country are so sitting out midterm elections and even larger numbers sitting out local elections and then you've got the people in power making decisions that are really quite extreme\nThese are not the kind of Nineteen sixties or Nineteen seventies moderate politicians these are people once they're in power they're going for it\nAnd if they don't they know that they will be replaced than the next primary the sense of moderation response of this responsibility to majority of Americans has disappeared\nAmong our political elites those who are in office or are closely connected to the process that elects officials there's been a major break down and the norms and the behavior of our political leaders today it's about go as far as you can as fast as you can\nVersus the pattern before the Nineteen seventies which was a bit more cautious and emphasize building coalitions and finding where the majority of Americans were at least on salient top of the agenda issues\nWhich brings us back full circle to where we started which is your correlation of people's faith in the government with the Democratic process\nAnd that brings us to a point where we have opinion polls that show the policies that would reduce inequality you you know higher minimum wage for example host show those are broadly popular but those have good Norman's difficulties getting an active and is that the result of this polarization of the political parties to UC\nAbsolutely I think one of the biggest signs one of the most significant vital signs of a democracy\nIs whether those in office\nListen to what the majority prefer and America we're in a dangerous on again and again on the major policies\nFacing our country particularly so is affecting the economic well being of Americans you find majorities of Americans supporting those policies whether it's health care reform minimum wage\nAnd others and then you find a political class in Washington and our state government that are on moved there don't seem to be motivated to respond to what most Americans prefer instead they couched how to the idiot logically extreme\nActivist within their party they know if they don't follow the party line that they will be replaced\nAnd that has become a tremendous corrupting influence\nThe path forward for beginning to address the deep and growing economic inequalities of America is well known we don't need a study for it the problem is that our political process is paralyzed\nAnd it's been unable to respond to this transformation of our economy that is driving the upper classes even higher and stagnating are pushing down just about everybody else that America\nI'm actually an optimistic person by nature but I'm also someone who follows\nResearch and data and I find this moment in American politics to be very sobering this is a hard period for me as someone who studies politics and public policy\nTo be optimistic we're really at each other's throats but here's something that I find interesting which is when you leave Washington state capitals and you go out and you spend time with people in the country\nThere's some things that are developing that I find quite interesting I see a lot of energy\nParticularly among young people and folks who maybe have not been part of the political process I see a lot of communities coming together and looking for solutions because they know they can't trust Washington state capitals\nI'm also encourage that even over these policies that are so polarized like health reform we see movement if you look carefully\nI've been doing a study with a colleague at Cornell University Suzanne Mettler and we've been tracking a group of Americans since twenty ten when the Affordable CARE Act was passed\nAnd when we started it was what you'd expect our group of Americans representative of the country were very divided along party lines\nBut now they're moving into the eighth or ninth year of the four double CARE Act we're starting to see real movement\nWhere Republicans would favor repeal are now saying well maybe this is not such a bad idea let's see if we can improve it\nWe're starting to see greater support for\nSome of the very concrete provisions like protections against preexisting condition exclusions or expanded Medicaid coverage or subsidies or benefits for seniors and as some of those partisan divisions of began to break down we're also starting to see an uptick\nI wanted to ask you about this you've just finished a book about the tension between democracy and oligarchy through American history I Wonder whether what some see as the golden age of the post war boom or is that the American ... a prosperous society where many people have opportunities or is that\nAn anomaly and the kind of inequality we saw in the Nineteen twenties or today is that more than\nYou know I think we actually go back and forth between the two we have periods in American history where people really focus on equality of opportunity and the gap between the rich and the poor tends to get a lot smaller than it does at other times and then there's the policies that you need to put in place to guarantee equality of opportunity\nCosts money they cost tax dollars and they have in the ability of people at the top of society to do whatever they want and they start to get angry about that and they feel a backlash against that kind of legislation\nSo you have after periods when you have an expansion of equality of opportunity say in the Eighteen sixties or in the progressive era or in the Nineteen fifties\nYou get a backlash against that that tends to be racist and it tends to be anti immigrant it often is anti female and you get the argument that any kind of equality of opportunity any kind of government attempts to guarantee equality of opportunity\nCosts too much money they cost too much tax dollars and therefore are infringing on the liberty of people with money\nAnd you get as I say this Dina phobic and racist backlash that tends to make sure that money concentrates increasingly at the top of society until you get to a place as we were in the Eighteen fifties or the Eighteen nineties or the Nineteen twenties or the president\nWhere there's way too much money at the very top and not enough in the next Ninety nine percent and you have to have a revolution in the system and I don't mean literally a revolution as in guns in the streets but people's minds have to change and the governmental system has to change and it does it's happened so quickly throughout our history\nWell let's go back to the actual revolution or were there were drawn to at least most gets and right after the period when the framers wrote an adopted the Constitution's now obviously there were enormous opportunities with a continent or behind you are but the people she fairness as a goal\nSaid when the phone talking about the revolution they're not actually talking about the fighting there talking about the revolution and men's mines that takes place before it to them the fighting was actually sort of not exactly hotter sold that sort of uh\nThe way you cemented the change in ideas that had happened before the fighting broke out so when you talk about the revolution what they were really thinking about was the way people thought about government\nAnd what that meant was the acceptance of colonial's at the time they're not Americans yet but the acceptance of colonial's of the idea\nThat all men are created equal and of course you gotta put fences around that they meant white men they tended to mean that men of property they certainly didn't include women but the concept that all people had equal natural rights was indeed revolutionary\nAnd it was not clear that that kind of a government the idea that people should have a say in their own government in their own and the rules under which they lived it was not at all clear that that was actually workable that this was going to actually turn into a country that\nCould survive so in the Seventeen nineties when
