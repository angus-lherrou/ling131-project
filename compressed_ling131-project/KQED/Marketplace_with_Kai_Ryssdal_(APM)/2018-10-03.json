Morgan Chase security guy medicine fixed up to the forty eighth floor where we called our heels for a little bit waiting for Jimmy diamond that's on us we were early\nSo we had a chance to poke around a little bit lots of sports memorabilia on the shelf business and management books to interestingly enough bank history stuff as well I'm In showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's the son and grandson of stockbrokers by the way and then we got down to it\nDo you think um people understand banks in this economy like you understood banks when you were to some people are saying things\nAs a consumer so you know if you've taken a mortgage or have a checking account you have a business need alone if you're a large corporation you have to sell equity your debt that they understand they don't necessarily see the inner workings of the bank does it matter what it does to me but I don't I don't think should matter to the customer no but the customer wants to do a good experience and you know good credit card and a good yeah\nYeah but it doesn't matter whether American consumers understand the way the financial system works\nI think it I think it matters to understand how business in general works\nSo if you don't have a financial system you don't have an economy so defense this was just part of his great economy in America has the widest deepest most transparent financial markets world's ever seen in total I'm including private equity venture capital the formation of business the transparency of our capital markets\nAnd no other country the world has it it's not even close is kind of\nIt's kind of a party engine that makes us the most prosperous economy in the world\nYou come to that we I guess come to that not without some scars right and we'll get to the crisis or a little bit later on but but what do you think um the financial sectors role in this society is what does the banks responsibility in this society\nI think the most important thing is you help grow a prosperous economy that helps the most people and they create the wealth by which you could take care of your old you're sick you're poor and so I I think people should assume that you need a healthy baby system my daughter asked me and their financial crisis\nYou know what's your financial crisis it was a kind of didn't have to be seven to ten years I wasn't being facetious I was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety\nAnd ... and one of things that makes me cautious as knowing all that I always always always wanted to run the bank that we can survive anything so that were there in good times and bad times and more more important in bad times for clients\nLots in there and we're going to get to the crisis in a second as I said I Want to talk to them for a second about I'm a corporate social responsibility which you are and this banker believer you talk about that a little bit\nI go I I've never believed it only seems to maximize shareholder value in fact I don't know any CEOs were that way I think these\nCompanies wait so sorry how how come everybody thinks all companies just want to maximize your ... it\nJust becomes a narrative it gets repeated over and over companies have to do a very good job over an extended period of time to get customers back\nAh companies that take care of customers succeed if they rip off customers they don't\nTo me if you don't take care of your employees you don't take care of your customers you will not have financial success okay and so they're they're all related and taking care of your customers are clients\nDidn't think we should have paid it put us knew all so many places I've forgotten number of how many branches regard but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform project more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now\nTo avoid something like that happening again\nGot ... you should never be satisfied or I mean I'm more explained that we're doing\nThe regularly should I say they really should be happy to take a victory lap I give you just do remember ducks it wouldn't happen\nThey would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty but because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquid ... a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity most over cap wise for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah ... it was a dish or to unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse 'cause they had to sell assets that was ...\nSo the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger but with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess where the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I guess still sort of my client does not have to run a panic\nBut not always be quite asking that question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses\nAnd I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking severe regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening in a way from banks are you worried\nAbout you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly what you expected so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road she'll be happens is too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my in my company could easily handle it but it is possible just like just like [noise]\nJust like just like the terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like James who can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\nYou jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get to ... but the luck plenty back you up for a minute on the healthy account and I'm not going to argue that the headline facts right jobs GDP all of that good stuff but as you sit around the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy\nThere's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen your way and I'm not I'm not sure but the good in the back yard All right so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all the all the food water energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave us freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom enterprise the best universities wisely with capital markets\nAnd yes it can be quite a real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to hurt the economy has been going in Munich early and it's ... it and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but lord and there are fixes the American poet you know everything we talk about their or fixes for we put our minds to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it\nI appreciate the positivity generally I Do it but there are some reality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we're pulling back from the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First right so\nYou reconcile that with what you call for new letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere we are so we have that flipping a bit to\nMake all that we have not had more candor Mexico's is Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's actually going quite well\nAnd we should treat them very respectfully but you're actually practice trade issue I'm going to call a skirmish\nYeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade was so what do you see that's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish does it sure doesn't look like anybody is backing down\nBack look we devised the president that why we aren't while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand the issue to China and he's right non tariff barriers\nTariff barriers for property all intellectual property is owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day the president succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems\nSo she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamond self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy\nYou're I don't think so I mean there are enjoying a lot of ... eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and a lot of other big banks still I'm I I'm going to be competing with the Chinese banks folks I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already have a bigger home market they make more money to work more in the market I there's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do they have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they showed their find your Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also practical one day with alley pay and we chat ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're going to competitors I Want Jake more chase to be the best bank in the world I\nWanted to be an American bank and it would be I think it'd be a mistake for America the best things in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks well so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy or get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy that is true for banks of truth for auto company just true for ... industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is to clients\nThat it's not the company because capitalism forces to return to the company lower uh and and also our size and diversity it's why we had no issues to\nDistort [noise] there was a whole lot more to that interview of course Jamie diamond on the next crisis for
