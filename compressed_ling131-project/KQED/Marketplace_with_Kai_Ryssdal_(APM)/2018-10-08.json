to some of our Basic Instinct\nFew have given more thought to what divides and unites us than Kwame Anthony Appiah professor of philosophy of law at New York university\nLaw applies those skills to practical problems as the author of the ethicist column for the New York times his books include cosmopolitan ... the honor code how moral revolutions happen\nAnd most recently the lies that bind rethinking identity Kwame Anthony Appiah joins us from his office at NYU it's great to talk with you again has very good to talk to Neal\nIn a world of ever more tribal identity is your book looks at five factors creed country color slash\nAnd culture five factors we used to find ourselves in that others used to define us on examination none of these turns out to be simple all of them are based on the stakes miss is your own store your identity and a capital\nOf the contradictions within and among what is supposed to be bright line definitions\nI mean I suppose one reason I thought about this so much for so long is because I'm you know my mother was English my father was governor and I live in the United states I come from\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info session will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford ...\nBy well if I might be since since I'm sort of brown skinned and many people that guy looked like an Indian but I don't talk very much like an Indian and I'm going to sound like the by sea ice will likely they say is I was raised to talk like if you see 'em and in fact my my mother\nAh who's no longer alive I bought some video of her the other day and I realize that the person my mother most times like a distinguished queens she had a very\nVery particular kind of English accent\nFor each of the categories that you talk about for identity are vastly oversimplified but why do you think it became such power\nWell I think because we're we're sort of programmed to thinking these essentially tribal tarnished comes\nBecause presumably because it was adaptive a long time ago on the that's where evolution race of anti when we were so it's becoming a species and we're trying to deal with the fact that\nHuman beings lived in small groups which are competing with one another and we needed a psychology that would made great the groups held together so that they could compete it's very easy to town on clannish innocent human beings\nAnd so that's one reason and then once it turned on\nIt takes us to turn it off so that's why that's so persistent I think\nThat's a big problem\nAnd I think there are solutions to it was one of which is obviously that unfortunately people have more than one identity and so sometimes we can use one identity to undo the the bad effects of another\nAh for example by the differences in their views about lots of political questions and in many ways I think people's fiscal views are generated by the sense that well this is the view of my tribe rather than by thinking well what do I actually think about this the vast majority of people\nUm but I Do not think that as it were all abortions should be permitted\nAnd the vast majority of people also think that many should be and the disagreement is about the boundaries but the party's represent essentially the basic either too extreme views or\nThe Democrats currently hold them as where there should be no limitations a total and emotions and the Republicans hold them as many as possible inside let's try and change the interpretation the constitution to make possible more\nSo I think that there are many cases where the the parties are a very very sort of divided in these hostile ways generated by the sense of tribal identity\nAnd if we can get away from those\nIdentities for the moment and think of ourselves for example all as Americans which is another identity or we might be able to to do more with them\nYou've argued that just by you know exposing ourselves to different kinds of people we increase the likelihood of understandings is the idea you called cosmopolitan\nAs him but when we look at the map of the United states in red and blue urban and rural or we see that uh people you know self segregate themselves there are a lot of like minded people in uh Brooklyn New York and and in billings Montana\nWhat's the resolution yes well I think that is a great difficulty there has been a kind of sorting and and people used to live more in in both in the country and in the city people used to live more in communities where there was a regular interaction I live in New York City there's lots of Republicans in New York City\nBut um I don't find that I meet a lot of [laughter]\nI think that's because ah in the current moment with all these tensions people try to avoid politics a lot of the time so even if I Am leaving Republicans are neither of us is going to bring politics up because there are more cheerful topics of the moment\nBut partly I think it's because you know social circles are increasingly divided along these lines and that means as you say that the the mechanism of\nForming links and friendships across these divides\nWhich which is just to spend time together doing things and\nYou know working together to run the league's going to church together and synagogue and temple and so on all those things if we don't have those then this ... this mechanism which allows people of different identities to get along or doesn't get off Russia if\nSo it would be good to persuade more people of the biological truth because the hatred is a good thing and it might help loosen people's attachments to these things\nWhich are very often you know bad for our society not every moments of racial identification is bad of course I'm\nA racial identification brings people to black churches where a wonderful thing happened I didn't mean to say that every elements of\nRacial identification is bad but I think again it's one of these things where if we could just remember that we're yes we're black and white and the other one brown and so on but we're also we're all Americans are all New Yorkers or whatever it is um that would help and loosening the attachment to the racial identities\nBy saying to people that you know this isn't actually as deep as we've been inclined to think might help\nWhen you talk about the social reality of race nowadays I Wonder if you on TALK a little bit about holidays become self front and center in today's America that is\nI Wonder if our emphasis on race stands and it's a shorthand today for politics because race has been blamed for cell by the right end by the laugh in terms of identifying their tribe is that realistic or a fair way to look at the question\nWell clearly there is a connection between our political drivers is among a racial tribalism\nFor reasons that I think patently intelligible the vast majority of people who identify as black\nA dog I voted for the Democratic party's far as I can tell for the foreseeable future less Republican voter changes and a similarly there are now increasingly\nPeople tend to stress the sort of working class components of the of the white Republicans right but I think that's a bit misleading there are people of all classes who identifies white who um think\nWho um think of the Democratic party I think as having to put they touch it's most extreme gone to war against white people forcing white people\nEvery day to confess to um crimes or to taking advantage of privileges to where I Wish I Know some type of racial privilege and so on and so they feel but as it were backed into a corner and so they\nThey think of themselves as unable to support the Democratic buddy even if they agree with with many of its policies um on other topics so I think yes there is a connection between race and our political tribalism and it's producing again the system a situation where identity\nTrumps actual politics policy at\nTrump's people's thinking about well what do I want to do do I want to have an effective universal healthcare system\nUh well if it turns out that your tribe is against the current system then you'll be against it even if if you are able to stand back from your tribal identity you might say well actually this is a pretty good thing and the same is true I think you know among could think of things that the Democratic tribe or doesn't I think reflect sufficiently about\nI think for example a lot of Democrats are\nMore hostile and they respectively should be to the role of business but he's in our society in generating the wealth which we can then ... to build the social welfare system and the health care system and the and and the public institutions of our society so I'm\nThe drivers and just gets in the way of uh in these contacts of thinking fruits are the issues there are better ways of thinking about the about trades than that and there are better ways of thinking about how I Wish things about Russia than just attending to whether the president\nLikes the Russian leader but because of the way I'll Try for politics with that's how these things end up working out\nWe're talking with Kwame Anthony Appiah a professor of philosophy of law at New York university is new book is the lies that bind rethinking identity and let me raise another of your categories\nCountry the idea of what you've called cosmopolitan as we've talked about it before where many people define themselves as citizens of the world well it seems to be in retreat in many places not least in this country nationalism is on the rise and not just nationalism nativism and it's just one of those other\nAreas where these identities intertwined isn't this directly tied to race\nYes I think that there's always been the sound of American nationalism that was tied to ... I don't know whether we can show that the numbers if you increase but we certainly have seen a rise in the visibility of a form of American nationalism that's a racially defined and that means it's anti Semitic as well as anti black and that it has residences with\nCake ...
