Willie Brown appointing due to a city commissioner at the border for ...\nI'm Sorry chair of the party and traffic on what they what his chair I have no idea I think someone from local crime for news actually this is my vision I said definitely like I pay my parking tickets I didn't even know what chairman and I was the president of the damned parking driving to miss by the way we really didn't tell anybody\nI got a call from going on John's is chief of staff or his main person and said hey the mayor wants to point a film commissioner Mike nice twenty two three years old film commission now you're talking ... no ... yeah it's more in line with my expertise at the time I didn't have\nA little bit on it was all\nThis you know I mean white two on his press I go down to separate city hall and there's like fifty of us any everyone's raised and he says a few things about everybody says and my new chair of the park in traffic and didn't tell anyone fairly told no one\nThey told them all the empty positions and classic Willie Brown just sliding you guys are so baptism by fire inspiration desperation I'm running meetings and it was a time would actually raising the upper deck in the central freeway and there's actually some real issues we have big problems with\nThe CEOs it's time we didn't call draw yeah caught a meter maids and now you're not changed even accurate parking control we did\nI called them meter maids and now you changed even accurate parking control we did parking Troy officers of the month and I started I you know getting them rewards and identify gift certificates because they were abused racial epithets people wrote the nastiest things on their ticket blaming these folks for doing their job\nWith one person that was shot out with a pellet gun and it just sort of credit empathy I dug deep into the ... trying to survive and try to even thrive in that position and really a credit conditions were ultimately will they brought up on the board of supervisors\nWent let's let's jump off from there because from there he ran for mayor in two thousand three uh we'll grounds turned out and you ran or were portrayed as the\nConservative business friendly no candidate I Know what you were a businessman says on this guy and I don't know what ... goes back then five or six and everything's relative yeah\nSo at a restaurant I open the wine sort of another restaurant another restaurant got involved in a hotel\nAnd what that word obviously I mean we were sort of a centrist but and I'm Still I'm Still passionate pro business Democrat you can't be pro job an anti business and I've always maintained at\nFirst thing he did his lieutenant governor I don't mean to fast forward was put on an economic development time for the steak I mean a little crosshairs again and they haven't learned I was down at governor governor but\nThe point is that that's never left me and I am deeply entrepreneur and tries to solve problems man and not just manage problems and\nYou know we have twenty three businesses now are eight hundred employees and that's not to impress anyone but that's a big part of the narrative\nThat I bring into the work I Try to do and my willingness to going to take risks it right or to be a days just in terms of goal setting a which opens me up for criticism falling short of goals\nBut that's all part of that business background and one of the things that I went to ... learn you got to be accountable you got to take responsibility can't blame other people for the way the world is so I Try to bring that into the work I did a supervisor in a business really saved my life in a profound and deep way\nAnd it's really I think if I add any value I think it substantively from that lands in the social justice one\nOne of the big things you ran on the care not cash and ask them for people outside of San Francisco and this idea instead of giving and folks who are homeless a cash assistance that they should get housing\nThis very controversial um I guess I'm curious like where did that idea come from in and were you surprised by the blowback sort of talked about how you're you're a centrist by San Francisco terms\nYeah I mean there's an reinforced that centrist an image a candidate late because look I\nI I'm not ideological I'm open argument interested in evidence and I was a member of the board of supervisors complicit in this respect that every year we increased our cash based assistance\nIt got close to three hundred dollars when I first started and then we got close to four hundred dollars and I realized wait a second every month we're adding more money more people are on our roles and they're more problems crime rates around the first second third of the month Fifteen sixteen seventeenth or up\nOr we see overdoses what we call mercy room diversions\nAnd our emergency rooms and\nI started realizing the problem was getting worse not better and so what I did at the same thing I Do in business\nBest practices what our competitors doing so I went out quite literally went out to meet with Mayor Daley in Chicago and went out to Cook County I went to New York and went to Brooklyn queens the Bronx Harlem and in some of the boroughs to learn about best practices I started studying the issue of Utah and others came back and realized\nYou know what we're doing stuff that nobody else is doing and that led to the policy but nothing more powerful than is the founder of the Haight Ashbury free clinic and opportunity to talk to him and he said you're basically killing people\nAnd you're complicit in your part of the problem you basically handing out checks and many people are out there self medicating and they're literally injecting those checks and you are complicit that changed everything for me gave me the moral authority or not just as a supervisor the foremost already to move for within an effort but with an effort to address it\nThis is ...

have your long everybody yes\nLots of news today we get it but we are going to keep our eye on the economic ball and the ball on this Friday was the September unemployment report it was a good hundred and thirty four thousand new jobs and you're only fifty year low on the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent\nSo we will start there and then merger further or best farther afield I never get 'em right Catherine Rampell writes for the Washington Post Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones everybody\nHas ...\n... jobs day you're on that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that ah the jobs report was actually doing a little bit of a missile and the number of jobs but but people should be happy with the wages however are another thing entirely still and again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to the market for that right at rages wages where the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained for us in wages as a little bit lower than\nThan last month that but some growth at two point eight percent it was enough grounds to spark some concern in the market that this spillover to consumer and prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pickup and growth was enough\nTo concern the markets about inflation and rising rates and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and the president and where we stand it is somehow amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA a China is still out there uh we have a still a president who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have\nInstitutions yet we have a dynamic and strong and a growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with terrorists and counter terrorists\nAnd breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um [laughter] to try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place\nA plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly a breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure I is kind of fill their uh that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nThat that's a good one the debris globalization Neal put on your your actual certified economists at which as you point out you are\nA ... and pull it back for me to a you know thirty five thousand foot level and talk about what cats and we're talking about this idea that we are now distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics here being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done\nAnd where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's term and perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing which is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened took a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with\nThe north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China\nAnd the development of the emerging world\nUm we're we're in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back\nAnd so as much as markets chaired the continuation of NAFTA or some kind of knew named as rose that smells asleep [laughter] um\nIt's hard to translate a U.S flow when\nIn North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power in terms of their economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they set right\nIn the middle east you have some great launched a slow when that's a great line I'm okay look let me let me turn to the news today because we have to acknowledge it Susan Collins declaring that she is in fact senator from Maine to choose in fact in a boat to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nUh Joe Manchin doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court ah come you know mother Tuesday I Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody's economic agenda because there are things that have to get done right there are budget to have to get down there are\nSocial programs and and a foreign bills and all of that stuff still has to be done is thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller where does things were the things that\nI I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budget through for example that Congress has to manage or and and the presidency as well the executive branch as well\nOr at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggests that we are in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around\nFor the last crisis at ten years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's gonna happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones\nKnew it to you quickly please sure and I just want to add on to like cats and I think just said which was you know this was occurring the burnt political dysfunction if you want to call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nAre a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are are benefiting we're seeing some wage growth\nUh what happens when the economy naturally turns as part of a natural business cycle well that's when the government plays a wrong and what we need at that point as a government that functions together for the betterment of the economy and hopefully by then we'll get it\nNeal Richardson at ah we're Jones dressing room filled the Washington Post thanks you too thank you have a nice weekend one more quick thing about the state of economically right now especially in light of the jobs numbers this morning which\nAs you've heard but unemployment in this economy at a level not seen since Nineteen sixty nine year old and with what's been going in this week in the bond markets and I talked about that yesterday good economic numbers pushing yields that his interest retire\nAnd it gives me this comment from Chris Lowe he's the chief economist at the end financial he's also a friday a regular on the marketplace
