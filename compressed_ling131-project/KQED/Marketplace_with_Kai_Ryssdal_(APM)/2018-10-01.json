cat wage [noise]\nIn Washington DC I'm Lizzie O'Leary in for ... it is Monday the first of October good as always to have you with us\nAnd we start today with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiation U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd dish we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs are these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars are new purchasers of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack disagreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\nManufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs at the center of the rhetoric of everything I envy and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple what will you assemble cars and trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW\nRight now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yup Bush got up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone right we see that in my house or the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you made cars in Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers Dr way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supplied training funding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and us bureaucrat\nMessing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and this bureaucratic I'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent in since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars in sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is yet for ... next to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour that fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who makes sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what uh companies do when we just got pushed up sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw afterward and more robust Mm more automation to replace people in as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly to take up all of the terrorist against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table and it's a little thing what's your and what's not\nYet so right now we do have terrorists on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security soaked Canadian steel Mexican still still subject to that and it's more complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration and that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\n[noise] and just sitting here in D.C today what are the chances that song get approved by Congress\nWell good luck with your predicting a vote on this time next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats could brutal attack the house rights and historically Democrats had been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMy ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history questioned for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that ... mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S M. C. A. the White House says the agreement is day quote when for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he\nRuns lost his ranch is in ... Washington they grow apples and also hops you know for beer Washington state is a big producer of both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers we've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome back\nThings will be glad to be here\nI show based on what you know so far hum how does this do you look\nI'm so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be a excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taking away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think the people around you um are you know X handling a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important market for\nUs agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and uh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico had established the tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you're on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year has that ship friday sale\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good movement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were\nImposed that movement slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting here thinking this is just nasty again or are there different says that you see I mean how just plan for you on the ground is it the same thing with a different name\nIt does kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for\nFor us and our businesses um\nBoth hops in Apple's this looks a lot like or what we've had last for years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nI think we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe\nMexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops from around the world and would like to see 'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership\nA that we've pulled out of the more of these types of deals would be very welcomed by most of us in in our industries\nI ask you the first time you're on the show in twenty sixteen you were worried about having enough workers to do the work you do and harvest your crops or is that still an issue for you\nYeah it absolutely is labor in our part of the country appear a farm labor is is still a somewhat scarce for us in many other employers in this region a worm extensively using the each tree a guest worker visa program to help meet our labor needs\nAnd there are some bills that are you know somewhere in Congress right now\nThat would make some positive changes to the program but a lot of those efforts have kind of stalled out over the last few months and so we're hopeful that we will see changes to the program as soon as Congress is ready to act on it\nBe in the sixties some fifties tomorrow's highs from the upper sixties to the upper seventies [noise]\n\nThis is marketplace I'm Lizzie O'Leary infer Cairo's al General Electric told investors today that its CEO John ... out after only about a year on a job the company also said\nTo me that profit forecast this year frankly think not great AT T which raises the question what is the role of industrial conglomerate in today's economy anyway marketplaces any ill or has that one\nGeneral Electric is a far cry from the company Thomas Edison cofounded back in the Eighteen nineties today G. E. makes aircraft engines equipment for oil and gas production and medical imaging among many other things perhaps too many things as John Joseph he teaches management at the University of California Irvine\nIt is a time when the industrial conglomerate is gone\nHe says competition and market conditions change very quickly today so companies have to react on a dime\nTypically big industrial conglomerates one does not think of being nimble\nGE he's been trying to focus the firm's sold the insurance outfit years ago it rained it swimming business after heavy losses during the financial crisis Lawrence white economics professor at NYU says these focused trends tend to ebb and flow well gee is trying to get smaller\nAmazon is going in the opposite direction\nHe's right Amazon got grocery stores Web services and is talking about getting into health care all a far cry from its original idea of just mean when you books but John Joseph UC Irvine argues that Amazon is different because it's leveraging a central platform so even though it appears to be spread out it's more focused than it seems\nAmazon is attempting to bring you know those that are selling stuff together with those that are buying stuff genes are different based\nIn one that has to move much more quickly than it has in the past I mean do you learn from other places [noise]\n\n\nI Want to take your mind back in time a little bit to the growing cities in the early twentieth century back then rent strikes were common tool to protest conditions and crowded tenements\nNow it seems to practice is making a comeback in Los Angeles and other cities with tight housing markets Cape you see the mathematical reports\nIt was bad news when Joe wanna chores landlord told her back in January that her monthly rent would go up by a hundred dollars but the alarm bells really started going off in April when the rent went up again another two hundred and fifty dollars\nAnd everybody said thinking whoa this is so much\nThe same thing happened to virtually all the residents of the Burlington apartment a two hundred unit complex just west of downtown Los Angeles built in the late Nineteen eighties Eli has rent control law but the Burlington apartments are two new\nTo qualify that's when I started realizing oh no no something is wrong this is that right and then that's what they're getting information and that's when we started going to strike\nA rent strike to pressure the landlord into negotiating rental rates and addressing neglected upkeep tenants in about eighty here it's just stopped paying rent on a recent summer evening about two hundred residents an activist marched through their neighborhood in protest\nBut [noise]\nYou have tenants who have been living in deplorable conditions for for

their legal rights like how in California they can withhold rent for landlords fails to properly maintained a building\nAll they have or they're red checks and so they use that because really they don't have any other recourse\nIn a written statement landlord representative FM male management said that rents have been raised to cover operating costs LA's not the only city to see red strikes a check of the Web turned up similar actions this year in San Francisco New York D.C Houston and Portland\nThese are all places that you would expect them to be if you're Michelle Wild Anderson a Stanford professor who studies urban poverty\nThese are places that aren't we could think of a job or rich and housing pour\nThat is metro areas that have added many more new jobs and residents than housing unit the classic recipe for high rent\nRent levels and the housing conditions have gotten so far out of whack with each other that people basically start yelling from their window is that they're not gonna take it anymore\nBurlington resident re Estrada gave me a tour\nOf the complex rotting walls are soft touch recently paid it surfaces or crack showing mold underneath in the parking

not complaining do we just want to get free rent no we want to pay a rat but we want to live in a safe environment in its\nStatement FAO management says that all maintenance requests are handled immediately but rent strikes don't come without risk in the case of the Burlington apartments the landlord moved to evict the striking tenants they dropped most of those suits in September after tendency agreed to pay what they could impact rent\nBut at least three tendency were evicted in Los Angeles and matching them from other places [noise]\n\nThis final note before we go today choose
