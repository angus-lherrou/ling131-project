that I think it's really important to know when you're talking about this and about the dark money coming into Montana and elsewhere\nIs that it's targets are not simply Democrats his targets are Democrats and Republicans anybody who seems to be considered too moderate and not really with the movement conservative agenda you want to talk a little bit more about that\nYeah you know the basic architecture of our film in watching Republicans to some describe them as moderate all although I I mean these guys are pretty conservative Republicans it's not like these are these are squishy Republicans that we're talking to\n... no not at all um these guys are really ... you know Republicans but they're attacked by a people within their own party that just feel like they don't represent the\nThe ideal said they want their Republican Party has so we're looking at this international battle within the Republican Party that's not to say that it's only Republicans who are involved in dark money spending\nActually over the course of the six years that it's taken me to make this found\nI think you have to be fair and admit that this dark money spending was really developed in I Would say weaponized at the federal level by the political right but more and more I'm seen this money spent on the political left for example and the nomination fight for judge Kavanaugh\nThere was a bunch of money spent by a five oh one C. four group she advocate for the\nNomination of a judge Kavanaugh\nBut that was also another group is that sprang up to oppose that and it did so by using a five on before dark money group it's important you noticed a couple of things with that one is just this very basic fact that ... when we're talking about dark money spending we're not just talking about\nCandidates running for elected office that we're also talking about judicial nominations and sometimes elections\nAnd so let's think about how dark money function in those judicial nominations I don't know who spent money to get Kavanaugh nominated you don't know who spent money\nTo get happened on nominated but she answers our cabin I'll probably knows who spent money to get Kavanaugh nominated and how are we ever to\nKnow whether there should be a recusal in a case that comes before him how do we know if there was any sort of influence that was operating and not nomination fight\nAnd I think it's just important to to realize just how especially pernicious anonymous money is when it comes to the election or a nomination has judicial appointees campaign finance is a pretty abstruse subject what what sparked you're interested in is\nIt that stirs and it's also super important and I think it's just a really fundamental issue I mean regardless of which political

funding it and we're all this money is coming from and where that influence is\nTo be honest I didn't quite know what to do with it for a couple of years until in two thousand and twelve\nI saw that my home state of Montana or what's going to defend this corrupt practices act of Nineteen twelve that we discussed earlier\nAnd that that case was going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and when that
