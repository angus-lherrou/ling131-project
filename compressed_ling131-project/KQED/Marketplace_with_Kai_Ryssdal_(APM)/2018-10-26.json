Sacramento [laughter]\nAnd welcome back to political breakdown I'm Scott Shafer along with Marie so law goes we're here with US Senator Dianne Feinstein before the break we were talking about ah the terrible years when there were two assassinations in San Francisco and there's that iconic film video of you announcing to the world and city hall\nIt's seared in anybody's mind was seen it before I just wondering when you think back to that moment what were you what was going through your mind\n...\nWhat happened to me is everything else blocks out except what I Am doing and what I Need to do so it's it's a phenomenon I Can't explain what happened but\nI can just perform I can just keep going\nAnd it's not by will I Know that but it happens that way and I think over time it's served me in good stead because when I've had setbacks and these assassinations I mean I wouldn't trade\nAnything for them they're terrible you know it's just it's awful when it does to family and for spouses and the city and uh the trauma and the gay community and this was the first openly gay\nPublic official in America and I remember leaning over his\nBody and getting a pause and everybody else was gone and I thought oh my God how can this be you know this is San Francisco how can this be but it was\nYou can hear on our video to like the gas so the reporters and and just you know the shock of the city\nI'm just curious I mean we are in such stratified times nationally and I mentioned you know that was a very that event was clearly the center of a lot of you know kind of crazy things happening in San Francisco there was Jones town um there are other events\nDo you worry now about sort of where we're at nationally\nWell I Do worry where we're at nationally because there's a what I've learned over time is people are fragile they may not appear to be so but certain things in sided them break\nAnd they do things that they never thought they would ever do\nAnd one of the things that you so need is a president that brings people together the beauty of this nation is our diversity we are many different people we walk to the sound different drummers um and ...\nWhat a president does is chart a course that's acceptable for everybody and in so doing brings people together and this is not happening so I Do worry about\nThe country because we are very diverse we have many different people many races creed colors background what makes America great\nBut it also makes it vulnerable\nWe but we had a kind of governor Gavin Newsom on a few weeks ago and we asked him this question I Want to ask you as well you know everybody in public life\nOr has sort of an image and sometimes the images accurate and sometimes it doesn't quite square with the reality or the way they think of themselves and for you you know I think people see you as sort of interest to use the shorthand Pacific Heights\nWealthy or somebody who's sort of above everything or somebody who has had a you know use the upbringing all those things\nWhen you think of that image of you when when you hear people talk about you is that kind of person like what what's missing from\nAllergen you see I've never heard that and I didn't have an easy upbringing for reasons I'm not going to go into here but it was not easy and yes I happen to Mary I'm a man who\nUh is is financially a astute let you say and uh but I never had a lot of money and I worked all my life\nAnd I think that was good for me\nSo I don't consider myself a Pacific Heights nature and whenever that is I mean I was at work every day at some job\nAnd so people I think rush to miss characterize and I would say you have to take into consideration or my real history\nSay you have to take into consideration or my real history which is my everyday history of what I Do with my life and how I Try to help and uh what I Do with people and the kind of builds we put forward and the time the successes when we have um and the failures when we have\nI mean one thing that struck me looking at your biography us that you were a single mother and what the late Nineteen fifties early Nineteen sixties before marrying her second husband\nUm and and and the and then I was married and then became a single mother or that's correct which could not have an easy no at that time\nIn ... you'll love you got married young [laughter] that Iraq [laughter] that tells you something [laughter] I kind of fast\nForward when you decided to run for Senate in Nineteen Ninety two um\nAnd this was a time of the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hill hearings I've heard you speak about seeing her to testify and and how that impacted you um I mean can you talk about that and how maybe being a single mother earlier and and being a trailblazer as we've discussed\nImpacted that decision to run in what became the year of the woman but you probably didn't know that when you start when he decided to file your papers\nBut no I didn't um I had been serving on the California women to board the terms and parole and that um I I did it for six years I sat on some five thousand cases of\nWomen convicted of felonies in state prison sentences we ran of parole division at that time I was twenty eight years old\nAnd then obviously I went on to a to other things um\nBut um what is the question\nWhy why not\nMoment did you decide to run for Senate um and and what did you sort of bring with you having being a woman at that time um and and being part of the huge class of women running but you know not knowing how the it was going to turn out and you would just run for governor\nYes well that's the I think that's the point I had run for governor uh I missed it by two and a half percent um but uh I had a big constituency so there was a lot of encouragement\nTo not throw it all away but to use it and we did a run for governor a run for Senate\nAnd I was very pleased to represent the state and\nSurprise you the two Jewish women from the bay area you and Barbara Boxer both got elected\nNot really really not really you know it's like would you say would you be surprised to Catholics from that they are elected well I think so I mean it just it happens yeah definitely\nI just want to remind everyone that you're listening to political break down from ... public radio I'm ... we're here today with California's US Senator Dianne Feinstein I should add that we had Feinstein's opponent for the Senate Kevin daily on on the break down you can check that episode out at ... dot org\nSlash political breakdown um I think we don't want to talk about your time in the Senate a little bit you know you 'em sit on the Judiciary Committee out you have been very involved in the Senate intelligence committee and I\nAsk you about your relationship with the intelligence community because it seems like it has changed over time um you told another Jones a few years ago that your decision to vote for the second Iraq War was the decision I most

much\nBecause you knew there was going to be a buck numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be\nWhen the other Richardson from Edward Jones and Catherine Rampell from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody Hi Kay ...\nLet me start with you uh and and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on this GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts in it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the the ... to ... capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the tank and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nIt occurs me actually just thinking back to how I opened the show that I should have said there is that there are three forces right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts\nHow I opened the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus or if you will of what's going on\nLet's plan it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger grass and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact those low the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now things are looking good economically speaking and that is good as Catherine's had because the consumer is great\nI I hear some trepidation do in your voice Neal\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd terrorists in trade tension concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies\nBut it bears leaving them out well well uh so so here's the thing just on the street and ... and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars in the United states because of all these are not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those terrorists but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't\nI don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he's saying the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with\nA business group so I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nMillet other item from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered budget pal or his biggest the economic problem I'm even as a German pal told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about rage what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about it how to keep the economic for market renting how to keep economic growth in and stop funk still normalizing policy because winning us\nAnd we know that it will be all end eventually the recession hits he wants to make sure that he just took that as this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next session\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for\nPort Bill Richardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you think the ... thanks guys have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think\nLike the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping right will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\nIn [noise]\nHard\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nWould you do a little deeper as we're want to do around here and you can start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drugs last quarter was treated marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster would the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would've seen them much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent at the end of you know is chief us economist at S P global what you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaved nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nFilling up their shelves head of the holidays they may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to start now on how to read into her cell rather than having to purchase more cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings not McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out tax reform for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher still prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact starting to bite\nAt least at that country and company level consumers just start feeling it yet a majority responding to a recent marketplace Edison research poll fifty two percent said terrorists have no impact on them personally I'm Tracey Samuelson for market but\nWe've gotten some insights into the fortunes of a couple of key technology companies as they've reported earnings this week one key insight in particular\nHow many people use their services snap or Snapchat lost two million daily active users in his most recent quarter Twitter so it's active user base jobs at boots more fake accounts will get Facebook's active user account when it reports earning six week but it's important as they are to the company's though\n... old school sometimes just about the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you when you need long term archival storage you want something separated from the Internet and you want something that's going to hold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tapes\nIt's going to hold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Jason cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah it's a terabytes is equivalent to about a million bucks right now a a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes so that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one\nCar crash okay now\nThere's a corporate store you're right there's it's Sony and food you film or the makers of this tape that everybody know uses and we'll be using for a while and there are
