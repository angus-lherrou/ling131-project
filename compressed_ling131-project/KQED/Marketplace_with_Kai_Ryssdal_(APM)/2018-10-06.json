the yard news you know\nHard to explain when I talk to them every every\nConrad and his family are torn apart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nIt's not so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law\nIt's called the habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flight of sodas and the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon tennis arrow uses a lot to hammer them\nBernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws in the U.S and in New Orleans that can now put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bars Kobe Bryant\nFresh monitored or\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone might say that again\n\nYeah princes and in jail that over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and peace and spends his days along with over a hundred other\nMen we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out [noise]\n\nBut my hair down did you say [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nYou said he's locked up because of the habitual offender statue ... explain that\nThe d._a. promised me an interview for this story but he never gave it to me I asked over and over and each time he declined\nBut I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom that first person used to work for ... as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you in da\nAnd regular ears or seven years but in ... it feels like an attorney\nThompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used to have the actual offender statue back then\nMarriage a Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard that was as the\nVirginia law office relied or a better way of describing either it was just the way it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that that trough hunter stretch it it was the policy and said yes office in Orleans Parish to use that\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about that I bet you off center statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like the tennis arrow never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere is this mindset that the more people will be locked up in the more time that we give people the more when the stuff of crime problem\nPunished fine as far as from the front of shoes you know our services are under times\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there is office still use is not the actual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your client that's just started anyway you talk to the prosecutor and the judge is even a consideration for the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments of your arrested part of\nThe core of the case I also\nHave you arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge or leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it\nAll right this is a life like there's a lot of heavy [laughter]\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of\nThis law takes away the primary function of a judge\nThat used to fashion a census that's appropriate just simply for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the ... statute judges no longer decide how long a person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kick in the judge has\nNo choice if I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I wanted that treatments aspect they're conforming to be part of the sentence was a typical just after the fact that as soon as the one of the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes say twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just to go away and said [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da Da Nang ... just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon Canada's arrow\nI Lived in a shark and Russia are you sure oh wow I'll be going on ... street\nHillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is arrows private Catholic highschool both are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me I was with him as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything there's public safety can you sir public safety with no trauma jail or does public sector really demand ...\nIn the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what da Kenneth Arrow does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Ken is zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [laughter]\nI shared this number with the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on ... statute in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I\nI never her back and an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two da's ... so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge part almost anywhere else in Louisiana [noise] he'd likely be home already ...\n[noise] ... [noise]\nFrom what you're saying it sounds like the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken as always\nEmphasizes this hopes his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nI'd be remiss if I had what I consider to be a possible case and simply said I'm not going to prosecutors because I just don't agree with the law that's really not my call for you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not and it says it\nIs a law I think I have a responsibility to prosecute the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n\nThe ... line is I'm just doing my job why is he doing his job so differently than any other da and Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the actual offender statute that's how it's done and this man stress during from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Ken Johnston I Am\n... a coal criminal law specialists\nAnd I heard that really you go by Becky\nMay be a ... big you would\nDo a ... a ... you know this is\n... ... room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stuck by his computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nBecause the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing it but when Harry can it can do is\nWe'll ... we'll wait a minute here did lose his Harry Cohn exists the jazz singer\nWe'll we'll we'll we'll wait wait wait wait wait a minute or did he just said Harry Cohn exist the jazz singer\nNo that's a junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nWhen Harry ... came into office he used a multiple below two\nShows up in this issue of society that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of their lives\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promise to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney every comic pledges to use the powers rivers often don't perimeter your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhibited crimes against the some of his [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime is urging all over the country people were scared\nSome kind of ... so he brought this law back from when ... when do start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any person shot a third time to be convicted of any crime you shall be considered as I'm it's just a ... hobby labor for life\nSince this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that a vigil center laws really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speech to smashing the conflict as scary African\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated in a penitentiary\nAnd for people who couldn't be transformed it it would become a place for storage for forced labor force", "show_name": "Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal (APM)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "06"}
