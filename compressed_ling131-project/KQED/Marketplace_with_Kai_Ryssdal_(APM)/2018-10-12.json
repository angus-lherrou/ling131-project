[laughter] well\nYou know I it it and you know I'm just going to summarize me 'cause I was so we can make a whole show about this but you know you know my father was a ... he was a revolutionary right so he fought to overthrow the sun and but he was not you know he didn't believe in communism so when when the regime became you know that he was photo were\nIdealist a Democrat\nAnd that led to you know a lot of unhappiness a lot of problems in one of my uncles went up in prison for Eighteen Nineteen years\nFor political activities and those early years of the revolution were you know we're we're pretty brutal I mean the the people think it only the rich people are few of those people use those people left in the first year year and a half there were gone right away\nThe next waves of people were working class people you know and uh and so it it it was hard and how old were you when you left your host Thirteen okay so you remember that I Do I Do and you know I haven't been back since and frankly I'm I'm really glad that I did I went back or five years ago\nAnd it you know I still have\nFamily there than it was important what important for me why don't you tell me a lot of people of course Cubans who leave go to Florida right where that part of the country at least ... how did you end up in California\nYes so interestingly enough good part of my family actually left Cuba before during ... in the mid says these are and they they actually ... in Providence Rhode Island are now that\nI find that were not allowed to you about that if you are and what happens\nIs in the early sixties uh my my paternal grandmother started having problems for arthritis and the doctor says you got to get to a dry climate he suggested either Phoenix ...\nUm and so they stop in Phoenix and you know Phoenix early sixties was really a one horse town and they said no you know and they got to LA of course Eli already had a thriving Latino community and and so they settled there so when we left to but we came straight to LA\nAnd so you you go to LA you don't speak English from what I understand it and you're not at all\nNot at all wow not at all if you picked up surfing up surfing I dropped out of school\nYou know a lot of really embrace LA yeah I did I did I dropped\nOut of high school you know a really uh you know I struggle in the early years I struggle\nWith language I you know just to young immigrant kids you know frankly my never Hitler report actually it was very rare might never hit to be a surfer so that was the other so it's coming up all their you know sometimes people tell me you're always been the boss a yeah you know there will not allow a lot of surfers in my neighborhood but I've met some kids in high school that were surfers and\nAnd you know I I grew up around the beach in ... so that was and he joined the military right so I did I did and that you know for me was the turning turning point frankly that was my real winters in the early stages became a you know became a uh the the people that work around and I that's how I\nYou know went back to school got my uh you know finish high school because of course I had to take a GED test to get in but then you know I actually went back and finish got my high school diploma or it started going through college while I was in the army and then we're in the Vietnam War right this is right after that's where I got a well you know the war was really on the tail and this was after the Paris\nA talks and so they really there were no ... ... in fact I mean the when I first went in and I had a full expectation that I was going to end up going to Vietnam and you know my father was a\nVery red blooded patriot and he's the he's you know to the to the day he died you know he he uh he's probably more American than many Americans because of the you know American by choice right in many ways and he said you know those are I think the loose on this single serve\nThis country and does that reflect sort of more conservative politics of his and then and you as well ... unquestionably I mean you know look at it post a post the bay of pigs are being a Cuban than the u._s. was almost

I think during the rampart scandal and some of the corruption there you ended up becoming police chief in Mesa, Arizona which has the same county or a jar of pie a with a monthly rounding up Mexican immigrants\nI I'm just curious like when did it and we're going to get to I think some of your more sort of progressive policy and colonel justice things but what was what she planted in Cuba at during rampart inmates I mean ... how did you kind of come to where where are you ended up when you were hired in San Francisco is a place yeah\nWell you don't see this was the interesting thing okay so my dad has always been it was always very progressive right but he was a\n... not on the party soon so the word but in you know believe in democracy freedom yeah exactly and so um you know in and we were poor you know my my parents worked for minimum wage for many years you know you know so\nReally working class family you know my uncle was a union the federal union in low on 'em and uh\nSo we were kind of a Republican probably with a small art were Republican when it came to foreign policy and in Cuba and then everything else really he was a Democrat probably uh and uh so I grew up in that you know that environment is somewhat conflicting at times\nUm and then you know I grew up in a very poor neighborhood dry were a lot of the kids are going to drop out of school like I did many wound up you know the not doing well get along side of the wrong side of the hill so when I became a police officer initially by there was going to be a T shirt right so I even started my my my thoughts were to teach\nAnd then you know the it evolved into going into the police were tomorrow's one with the idea that the uh\nYou know I Want it to be in some places that I grew up kind of the same places and in and make a difference so that was sort of the beginning you know and then you know us years won by a I became more disenchanted with the the ... the way that the public safety\nWas hitting you know the the increasingly more punitive way of doing things in war or the you know really mass incarceration in and it was really by by the early Nineteen nineties early to those and then I started to say this is you know I'm I'm I don't see this having\nI saw your furnace about you know drug policy for instance I mean like you thought drug use\nBut across the board right there is no ethnic there is no ... by right Americans use drugs equal amounts or maybe sometimes even more when you're wealthy\nBut when you look at the people that were arresting writes there were all happened to be black and brown\nSo when you came you were recruited to come here from Arizona you bring the police chief in San Francisco gather new some are hired you know you could say well what was the culture ship what was that culture was a culture a welcome culture changed for you going from you know ... to San Francisco or was the kind of kind of a shock you\nThere's complete devastation at the window base\nNothing was faith in the wake of hurricane Michael every single building on that base a stump started damage um buildings or destroy angers or destroyed um as well as housing where a lot of those ...\nTend to remain closed until further assessments of total damage can be done I'm not a comic kick you in the news\nSupport comes from bay area cancer connections celebrating twenty five years offering breast and ovarian cancer support bay area cancer dot org marketplace is coming up next and then at four thirty on the California report this week marks the one year anniversary of the northern California wines entry fires\nThe California report checks in with people still coping with last year's fires that's coming up at four thirty here on Cape ...

this Friday to twelve October to have you along everybody All right so let's take your pick for where you want to start in trying to figure out what went on this weak economy was the markets the president and the fed the international Monetary Fund oh forget that one\nSo much to wrap up so little time here to do it in the studio with me or maybe I'm In the studio with them 'cause I'm usually in LA and you guys are here lead Gallagher's Fortune Magazine ... is at MSNBC and NBC News any high guy\nSo David let me start with you um and uh and the markets the banks give them a little bit of a breeder today the major industries they were up but suffice to say the best couple of days they just kind of split up all over themselves and we\nHad a good run market wise to drop so we saw this week we're startling to investors for sure um I think what you're seeing are investors reckoning with we kind of knew was coming out as the fed is going to raise interest rates Jay Powell to chair the fed it's talked about that\nAre looking at the economic fundamentals you'd expect it will be coming I'm suggesting is that you saw folks process and that I think you know there's some awareness to global you mention the IMF we can talk a little bit more than a minute here\nI'm Still a globalized economy and you know as the President Trump talks about his latest triumph for the new NAFTA yeah whatever it's called us and the early ... um there's still a lot that needs to be ironed out and there are plenty of investors plenty folks running companies are worried about how all this to shut down then\nShall we talk to me than about why everybody was surprised because Rosie insurance have been the ... everybody's been known it's coming and yet the past two days everybody just went oh my God that's\nThe big mystery I mean everything that has made markets go crazy\nWent oh my God that's the big mystery I mean everything that has made markets go crazy this week has been with us for so long I mean markets just completely shut off the trade war right in August\nAnd all this other stuff interest rates deficit everything and I think part of it is we know that this is going on for a really long time everyone is thinking you know there are we to complacent and I think that that's just\nYou know does the market know something that the economy doesn't know which happens sometimes not totally you know I I think the fears are unfounded I think when we see Netflix and Amazon come out with ... in the next couple of weeks I think I you know who knows but I Would think\nThat ... everybody's going to go yeah I feel better yeah for now\nI'm a David the president's a chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow made one of his many parents is on the White House driveway yesterday said look you kind of economic fundamentals are strong we've got growth going on and yet on maybe Monday or Tuesday I forget the international Monetary Fund came out and said\nHold the phone trade war terrorists were going to take our peg for global growth down a couple of nachos so there's a little disconnect there yeah\nI mean front and center here spend the U.S economy has been the Chinese economy as well all these global bankers economists are gathered in Bali for this big concept there ... all this stuff out and write they reduced the forecasts but us growth and for Chinese frozen in two thousand Nineteen um I think you're seeing that contrast that again we've seen for these many months now that you have\nWell respected economists saying they're going to be risks what's happening here and you have members of some inspiration downplaying those risks it's interesting to the division between those advisors to the president and president south we're talking about Jay Powell just a moment to go to the fed chair you had the president earlier this week\nCasting doubt even answered reporters' question does he planned to fire Jay Powell I didn't know that we've gotten there yet another guy that he picked 'em so you have a president now watching these interest rates rise fair to say no president wants to see interest rates go up um but there exists still this division between the president was revised\nYeah leave that point about uh the president or pumping Jay Powell and the ... told me on this program I don't care what the president says I'm going to do my job but but there is something about um why it matters that presidents attacked the fed is not least never happen but but this is real now\nIt really is and and write he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since he since he took over\nA but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know I'm writing interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's like you're totally predictable do in the sense that this president has hitched his wagging to the store the markets from from day one you've now scene of a sizable downturn in the market this week and he's looking for an excuse someone to blame for that that seems entirely predictable into it so as well he's somebody who does that often right so seeing the market drop it points represent whatever\nUh he's looking for somebody to blame this week I think it was ...\nAnd we should point out here that the markets are back to where they were on and you're not all that long ago I should have looked out the number of where I came in here but this is normal and to be expected and arguably healthy thing in any market rally\nAnd it was a time and time again it's your monitor here the Dallas not the kind of caught me right off the downright markets go up and markets go down under any each each showcase that time and time again that that ... unwillingness to engage with the fact that if it's going up up up up and go down at some point\nWe talked me for a minute about um ... we're going to get to this later in the program the trade war is still going on the Chinese and the United states still can't agree on on what to do about it there is a a ... effect that over time will take some of the air out of this cone\nOh absolutely I mean at one hundred percent and we'll start to see it next year\nOr this is big this is a big deal and this is now that the the the terrorists are with China has been vastly expanded in may be vastly expanded again uh this is this is dramatic and um it's actually amazing that it has an impact the markets until now\nWe're going to go back to their favorite of mine that actually it was suggested or ... or ... or Twitter fan of mine this morning he said listen let's do or what is Jay Paul thinking five words or less a which used to be of course the popular game show and on his what his Danielle I'm thinking if I were ... so David as you counting on her fingers go Jay Powell is thinking today what inside words or less\nHow to keep him at bay that'd be six letters sorry it's words how to keep him away keep your eyes or whatever [laughter]\nWait what does your ... and five words or less\nLike a haiku them stay the course calmly say let's find those of 'em are\n[laughter] she's a writer and I wish I was very late Gallagher a at Fortune Magazine\nThey regard from MSNBC

the New York fed show credit card balances rose by fourteen billion dollars last quarter and that that gets more expensive men says as interest rates rise\nSo in the abstract rising rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers but the real question is why are rates rising\nHe says the fed keeps raising rates because the economy is growing and if consumers keep demanding loans that's a win for banks as long as consumers feel they can afford to keep taking on that that in New York unjust and how for marketplace\nIt started when the Metropolitan Opera fired conductor James Irvine for alleged
