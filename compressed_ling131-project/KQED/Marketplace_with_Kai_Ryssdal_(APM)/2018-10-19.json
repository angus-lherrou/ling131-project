{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KQED", "content": "Um you know when we talk about that I mean the polls that we usually see and we talk about in the media or not these internal polls right so explain like what your relationship as in these campaigns and how like how does that work compared to the public polls that the rest of us actually the\nYeah sure so as a pollster who gets hired by the campaigns of campaign team consists of a few different consultants the poster the media can sold the person does a T. V. as a direct mail concerned as a male and then you have a digital consulting someone who does it you know digital strategy um and so we work as a team and my job is a\nHelp figure out the strategy had awareness insurance market research for political candidates or try to figure out a you know where the horse races and that's where the public polling focus on the horse right who's winning who's losing and that's it but my job is much more involved in that I have to figure out\nWho's winning right now but then how to write her a victory you're testing messages correct how people feel about various issues that could what issues they care about and what message is resonating both positive and negative so that's a big thing about what it is there a way that\nSponsorship of the cake you mean the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at Hooper micro dot com\nThat's a good question because there is a part of the business that is that that cynical and posters tell policies and what to say but I think the most successful politicians in this country\nOr no matter what side of the aisle you're on how to vision of what they want to do and then have a message and and you know my experience working for Bernie Sanders for example I'm\nTalking about like authentic yeah so I I had to convince them to hire me and his whole campaign team had to convince them to hire a poster I met with I'm In San Francisco actually was out here\nUh giving a I'm a Congress that I was interested in working for men worked for Howard Dean I work for the millionaires tax um so I worked in progress the space I saw as potential\nIrish chapters is media consultant who I knew for a long time Tad Devine and I said dad\nYou know I'd like to work for a music or to put you on the list of what\nI was the only one of the country are saying well because Hillary Clinton was it eighty percent of the polls in Ryan's crazy enough to take a ride for Iowa this yeah this was in two thousand ah early she doesn't Fifteen or like a dozen fourteen so\nUm and did you know them be honest like this guy's got a real upside to us I I ... yes I saw that he had potential I'd worked for Howard Dean so I saw that this progressive insurgent\nCould get you know a third of the vote maybe forty percent I just worked on the millionaires tax so I saw in California so I saw how angry voters worm that they really wanted to make the rich pay their fair share so I saw the opportunity and that's why I reached out to him I just wasn't a kamikaze mission I was on and I also saw that he was at zero percent so that\nI'm no D.C pollster would work for him so I mean is this young up and coming closer based in California and he says one reason he met with he wouldn't be with the D.C pollsters like I don't want to talk to those guys because I met with them\nAnd it was a hotel lobby somewhere and not feel I Can't remember the name of hotel now and a Tad Devine primates like over here the question Bernie's knock on a wire ... he he doesn't really believe in polling he thinks you're ... you're going to tell them what to say and so I had to go in there and say okay senator um\nUm I went to my Bernie impression of it is not very\nGood so I uh uh that he's you know ... like ... but then was yours but my ... my my daughter that they're giving me twenty ... twenty seven dollars they're on Social Security why should I spent their hard earned money on you and so I said well senator look I'm\nYou know if you're successful at this raise a lot of money you're going to be campaigning in lots of states what states you can't paint it how you going to know that is we pollster and the other question I had like a good lawyer I knew the questions to ask 'cause I knew the answers as a senator\nOr last night at your common what's called the vet how long was some speech that all it was like an hour and a half I said okay so if you're successful or\nHow are we going to turn that into a thirty second TV unity as if you're you raise a lot of ... how do you figure out of the hour and a half what material to put a thirty second TV ad that's where I come in so that's in my view the most effective campaigns and as much effect of impact posters habits take what he's saying and distill into thirty seconds\nSo do you have candidates though like 'cause that was my like Scott sided cynical my thought is like do they even listen to you know like we were you know we interview politicians all the time they're not always known for like you know taking the advice of other people are\nAre big influence is on the TV as a paid media right with the the average voter the information they get in a campaign comes from television direct mail digital not from what the candidate says right and obviously what we say shapes with the candidate says but you know being good kick UT reporters you have in depth interviews with reporters\nWith with candidates gives me but the average voter out there here's a thirty second TV ad or ...\nOr ... seconds of our interview rate actually and so they're not going to your everything they can it says so that's where our our job is to make sure that thirty second TV ad is on message and effective as possible\nSo there was a perception that the polling was off in twenty sixteen now you know every all the upshot New York times five thirty eight you know Nate Silver everyone was saying you know she's got this uh and they were shocked and election night in a lot of places are so what was your take\nOn what happened there with the polls were they wrong or we were where we just interpreting them wrong\nYeah I mean I look my industry definitely took a beating in twenty sixteen and I do think though that um\nI ... I was writing a lot of the time that cycle and a lot of pollsters getting it wrong and very proud of my record I got a long track record of being accurate when our posters miss the mark outlook my industry spacing real challenges I mean we were for decades you know two decades we were um [noise]\nUh relying on landlines to do collect interviews well guess what the plan line is is is going\nUh uh uh is going extinct so a ... cell phones we have to hand dial down so it's harder to reach people on their cell phones\nAnd it's getting harder and fewer people are answering our survey why do you have to handle a by law or if I could when Roy would changes or an F. E. C. F. FCC allow us to auto dial a research only not marketing calls but a legitimate research to be able\nTo to to to mess style cell phones um because it it's imperative part of collecting a accurate data\nSo I was reading about the sort of post mortem that the American association for public opinion research dead after twenty sixteen and they and they brought up a couple of things like national polls versus state polls right this idea that like\nHillary Clinton did win the popular vote but you know but that's not how we when the president um and then they talked about the kind of blame the New York times in five thirty and in places like that for aggregating these public pulls\n'em and then you know questions about whether they're a good polls in the final days of the election I mean do you agree with those assessments of some of the problems and\nHow can posters you better and twenty twenty\nYeah those are good question I mean so here's what I my own expression twenty sixteen for ... in the primary\nPay does does want to pay for it so if you do polling on the cheap you're going to get what you pay for it and you're gonna get inaccurate a pulse and and so the challenges from as a poster ... I was working for camping is raising a lotta money Bernie and we could invest money and the challenge was I had to figure out I was I was building a rocket while flying to the moon and figuring this out right\nAnd Bernie was doing really well for millennials and we realize that we're ... we're doing well money is when you get enough of them in our sample how'd you get them oh gosh I trade secret but it was very difficult very expensive in most public polls don't spend the money or time or effort to do that and you're gonna miss them are I mean the language differences too\nThat's that's in California and I do a lot of polling year and that's a real challenge in life what\nJust want to say you're listening to political break down from ... radio I'm Scott Shafer with Marie so law goes and we're here today with pollster Ben ... you know I Would imagine I Know you didn't work for Hillary Clinton so you can't speak for her but I Would think she had some pretty decent pollsters working for her and yet\nIt seems like they didn't see happening what did happen in Wisconsin Pennsylvania and Michigan they were sending Michelle Obama to Arizona you know thinking they would grab for that as a kind of a reach so like what what was going on there\nOr arrogance I hate to say it but it was painful because it was a tough loss if you're a Democrat that that's reverberating to this day\nIt was tough because you know Bernie won Michigan Michigan miracle came back you know five thirty at all the production said with less than one percent ... percent chance of winning pulled that went off a one Wisconsin you know we\nBurned it very well in the upper Midwest right and she struggled and I would have liked to have thought that the campaign would have called me and said hey what were you saying to compare knows unfortunately didn't but I I Wish that they had identified the weaknesses she displayed in the primary and address them which they never\nDid I just wonder what do you think would have happened if he had gotten the nomination and got up\nAgainst you wouldn't want and I tell you why because all the public polling shows and I write about five memos during the course of the campaign trying to explain this to the to the world Bernie\nWas more electable because he did much better with two key groups are independent she's an independent right especially independent men\nAnd three groups I should say a word white working class men like the Trump voter well the the old retired uh a auto worker in Michigan\nVoted for Bernie and that's how I go to Michigan right 'cause he has a populist message he railed against the political and economic status quo and his outsider he's an outsider and his critiquing of our politics\nAnd she's the cost of an insider so that dynamic a Trump wouldn't have had that car to on the outs are dealers the insider a Bernie would have been able to play been more effective and he was very popular millennials\nAre and who weren't enthused with Hillary so those those three groups Bernie would have done better with a and he would have won the election but I you know unfortunately you didn't win the nomination and couldn't find that out [laughter]\nAh well there is always twenty twenty he said nothing [laughter] okay so it was a member of the media like we only report generally on the public polls like the the the I think it's a

you want to explain what happened in the past five days which is what we're going to do with it Lopez is a Business Insider ritual Abrams is with the New York times they're both in our New York studios everybody\nEd hey so let let me start with you a will go back to Monday or the deficit figures from the Treasury Department up Seventeen percent from a year ago seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it kinda seems a that those numbers of lost\nOn meaning though they are well sort of I mean everyone told Republicans is was going to happen and they did it anyway it um you know the the\nThe deficit is the difference between how much we're spending and how much we're collecting how that continuously grows\nFor some reason conservatives have managed to convince Americans that if we collect less money will have more money against all logic\nSo now everyone's and in the Republican Party saying we might have to cut entitlements because now we have this crazy data and more money is going to go to interest payment we can get that everybody told them from the beginning that this is how it was going to look\nAnd uh it's just sad that we have this kind of weird cognitive dissonance it\nBears mentioning here and not for the first time on the radio program originally rooms with the tax cuts have never paid with themselves [noise]\nRight to add so I think the I think that that sort of the great irony and all of that says that um the tax cuts that a GOP push through which primarily benefitted or I I guess you should say benefited corporation and a and very wealthy individuals the most\nThat in order to pay for those tax cuts uh you have Mitch McConnell talking about ... to rise and rise cuts to entitlement programs\nAnd I think that kind of goes back to the question of well why do we care about the national debt why do we care about\nPaul Ryan said this going on a year ago now right that that entitled entitlements where the next thing but rich let me let me continue with completely foreseeable circumstances but now a appear on our national arise and uh there was news this week or more trade unrest Wilbur Ross was in Europe complaining about the European trade deals\nOr the Chinese now that is another thing that has seemingly heated up again with Larry Kudlow saying things but we got hard numbers from deep BMW down in South Carolina it's these terrorists are going to cost them a half a billion dollars a year it's not like nobody knew this was coming\n[noise] [noise] yeah and I think especially going into the midterms people are really wondering you know how it's going to this going to affect really hotly contested races you have soybean farmers in Iowa that were really concerned about the price of their crops going down because of the trade war\nI'm ... President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will\nHelp boost up a sort of his core constituents or centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help the Republican Party in the terms and\nI'm not right before we sat down here to tell an ounce and it was going to have laugh so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so open to have the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says is on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment's low we got corporate profits this week when that from the banks which are making ... of dollars what's not like\nWell except for some one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from this tax cut actually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is an indicator that um\nMaybe things aren't going as well as a as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow on and\nIt also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those when time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to Joe I enjoy the ...\nOn the market thing which I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now that we haven't seen for a very long time\n[noise] yes I and it's really interesting because the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessor as when we had seen depths\nUm I don't really I I and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and fight financial and business experts would agree that the markets are the stock markets are not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see I'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past year\nAnd these are mad at falls like a\nThousand points that I mean it is yeah ugly yeah and of course Trump used a tweet that if that happened to president should be fired there's a dirty bomb administrator there's ...\nThere's a river everything when you get the last word you got twenty seconds to do it just really quickly the fed minutes this week and and Jay Powell basically saying everything's fine we're going to keep raising rage everybody stay calm\n[noise] yeah I mean the you know there's no reason for him not to trade change course I think the stock market again is not the economy and President Trump should have absolutely nothing to say about the fat so there's actually no reason for ... how to change course it's not in his data\nAnd the stock market should not be something that he's worried that in fact he ... with the fed is probably looking at is topping a bubble\nAnd somebody's phone when officers who you're goes you been doing this for a long time now turn your phones off in the studio ...

Hi I'm Jennifer ...\nFor the GOP will get a couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by\nPoliticians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users that a court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair walk to the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixteen ... says we are pivoting the video at Facebook and journalism to does what\n[laughter] journalism give it to with it yeah basically and\nThey say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits ... maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I mean I think for publishers this was kind of a second ... they've already invested a lot of research then Facebook ads they see these kinds of eating into traffic so Facebook's ad recording video it's kind of like a thing where face because jumping publisher I say OK how high yeah until they invest all these resources into doing video\nAnd then in twenty six Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructuring to eliminate writer even higher video producer is how this happened to places like ah\nMTV knew that happened that block it as Mike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nAre so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but uh and the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said wait ... these video figures aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they lost and president and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a smoking gun advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that they can play the number is by in some cases allegedly at nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing what is your town [noise]\nPart of the pro marriage seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working in radio\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go round here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't doing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is going to see if they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of the numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or oh I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted hum because of what Facebook's had to do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think this this could be at and and they kind of just jumping up both eat\nWhat does Facebook have to say first of all\nI Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took some accountability and twenty six to ... when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that then it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters opening in court and then everybody's going to have their day absolutely Microsoft jak writer as a matter of fact I think\nThe phone on the way out today in which I Am sorry to be the one that has to tell you but you don't stand a chance
