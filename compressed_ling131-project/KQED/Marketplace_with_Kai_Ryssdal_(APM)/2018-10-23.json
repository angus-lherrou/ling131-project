... show or maybe the push to start actually is just with a little primer on on who or what Sinclair is because it's it's been a little a couple of months anyway since his company has been a miners\nSinclair is the largest owner of broadcast television stations in the U.S a and a lot of people are not terribly familiar with them the way they hear about CNN and NBC and other big networks uh Sinclair owns a hundred and Ninety two stations in eighty nine markets\nSo they are enormously influential they're seen by a lot of people are but they're they're largely outside the coastal media bubble\nBack up to that size thing because that is is relevant in a lot of ways uh for the context of this article because there are regulations and and considerations about who can on what media was right\nRight well regulation of television has changed over time and it has loosened overtime bite in general there are a lot of restrictions around media ownership for reasons of preserving competition and local markets and also because\nA diverse points of view and diverse sources of news are considered to be sort of fundamental to uh maintaining a free and open democracy\nSo dig down into this a little bit and give me I guess maybe the ... the first one of these the Sinclair did back in the day was in Baltimore and and explain how they got around the rules I suppose this is the question what can\nSo so what they did was they would acquire a competitor station or the FCC would say well you need to divest you need to sell one of these stations in order to comply with the regulations and the laws\nBut then ah they came up with a very clever trick is to help all their lawyers and they would just simply divest the second station to a shell company run by sort of a business associates or a member of this mess family which is a family that controls Sinclair\nYou said they would be able to say to the FCC that they sold the station but in fact the station was still not really independent and then they would sign an agreement that would give them the right to supply all of the programming to the station\nLet's get Sinclair response in your us them you know how did you guys get away with this in essence I may say their line has been for many years we've met all legal requirements right\nYes and they I mean incredibly they did a managed to stay within the strict interpretation of the law although they they violated the spirit of the law one could say but yes what they did was strictly legal um but it was it was ... and it was pushing the line for sure\nSo to the to the other half of that question then why did the Federal Communications commission led Sinclair do this so many times\nThere is no simple answer to that I mean the the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous monopolies to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for this I sort of fraudulent divested her strategy\nThey ended up finding that Sinclair had violated some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent divest teachers and um they find the company brace herself a forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like

does keep farming he'll consider changing what he plans to better reflect markets shifts\nTobacco is our cash crop but you know way of talking about other things he is obviously on the horizon you
