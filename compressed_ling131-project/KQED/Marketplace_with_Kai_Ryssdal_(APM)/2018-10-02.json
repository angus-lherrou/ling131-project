relationship between the U.S Canada and Mexico or many trade questions in general we'd love to answer them\nLeave us a note at marketplace dot org and there you can read more about economic winners from today's announcement on Wall street today the markets love that trade news do you do when we did the numbers [noise]\nWe have the latest chapter today in this saga that is Iran must and his relationship with Tesla the company he cofounded he's giving up a little bit of control over it that's the upshot of a settlement the electric carmaker reached over the weekend with the securities and Exchange Commission\nThe agreement settles fraud charges the SEC brought against mosque after he tweeted in August that he had quote funding secured for a deal to take tests all private except he didn't the agreement with the SEC is aimed at reigning him in marketplaces Nancy Marshall guns or report basically\nThe SEC settlement is all about keeping watch over eat on mosque and his tweets as his own worst enemy that's what's had to happen that's what the FCC has had to do Rebecca Lindland is an executive analyst with Kelley Blue book\nThe company needs to control Iran must better and you must needs to be a better student word of the company that he started\nTo the SEC is strengthening tests was bored mosque will step down his board chairman although he'll still be CEO tests to a point to new independent directors to the board Joe fish is a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania she says some lucky person will be pre approving Musk tweets and establishing\nHow those tweets are going to be set up a what kind of information they can contain it's an overall policy\nBut fish says must may be tough to rein in early this morning must we did a video from the hip hop band naughty by nature with the winking and ... that could be a reference to the SEC settlement if he and Tesla don't comply with the sentiment the SEC will step back in Carl Tobias teaches law at the University of Richmond\nReady to go back and so you are in violation of agreement took very crude open another suit to guarantee that he would comply with a settlement agreement\nOr maybe find Tesla again test what must both already face forty million dollars in\nPenalties in Washington I made the Marshall guns are for marketplace [noise]\n\n\n\n... may have given Tesla's board some headaches but now we're going to look at the composition of boards themselves California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill into law Sunday requiring that publicly held corporations headquartered in this state include women on their boards\nThis law as the first of its kind in the U.S we've got Jenna McGregor to talk about it she covers corporate governance for the Washington Post thanks for being a\nThanks for having me rundown of what this law is and who will be affected by it\nTo California Governor Jerry Brown just signed into law\nA bill that lawmakers there have been trying to get through for a long time to actually require companies that have their principal offices in California do you have what we'll start with at least one female director on their board\nDid do most sports include women already I mean how how unusual is it either to have women on board to not have women ...\nParticularly large companies most have a woman on the board large publicly traded companies\nBut uh their numbers show that about twenty five percent of companies headquartered publicly traded headquartered companies in California\nDo not have any women singer they're trying to fix that issue through having a mandate of sorts it will grow over time over the next couple of years they're going to add to it where it's not just one that you're required to have that depending on the ... the board they want you to have\nOne two or three and really most companies are probably going to need to have three that are headquartered in California\nWhat happens if your company's headquarters in California but say your incorporated somewhere else does this still apply\nFor the question here I said they have put through this bill but there are both business groups in California some corporate governance experts including a former members of the FCC has said you know what\nThis may not fly doesn't may face some legal challenges because many many many companies are\nActually incorporated into where it with the state that I have a little friendlier business environment and that\nYeah so law has set those are the legal circumstances under which a company has to follow and show it may not apply because they this this law may face some legal challenges for companies to say the shouldn't matter\nWhen Jerry Brown was talking about this he referred to recent events in Washington and and you wrote about the ah Brett Kavanaugh hearings in the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd sort of the appearance of having a female prosecutor there in the room um how much of this is about the parents and how much is about change in corporate governance\nWell I have seen the same question of whether he is trying to make a statement particularly this week although this was the deadline to end up September for\nDeciding to find it into law so what was this a way of making a statement of what the country has been engaged in a major national conversation about yeah I'm the issue of whether having more women on the board\nHas any impact is is a good question there is a lot of research that shows it does have a good impact that it leads to either higher returns or better decision making or a better price mergers yet\nThe question of how you do it do you actually need for choir than to do it do you have incentives for them to do it do you do it through kind of public shaming [laughter] and so what what is the best approach to getting more diversity on the Ford or getting more diversity in a room full of any decision makers\nJenna McGregor from the Washington Post thank

Amy Scott in for Congress do It's Tuesday October seconds good to have you with us before we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders\nHe called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bay those act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff ... is the bill would tax dig companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states of Amazon\nThe idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages well Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this she's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour [noise]\nWhat kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour or so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by that\nThey specifically mentioned part-time temporary workers ah they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about ... about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers Amazon\nAnd its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Walmart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that\nDirection really I think a skilled warehouse worker is already or\nSponsorship of the cage you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature banned political science and infection will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Shepherd ...\nBy the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of vigor wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where this raise we'll have more\nBuying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses\nAnd their ability to recruit and retain workers and the kind of local market would be an important thing to follow up after the announcement\nWe're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred and fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also kind of want to keep in mind what's\nHappening with inflation if wages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some uptick than inflation and want to kind of keep\nAn eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much things to any\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit meanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best Alex Harris is twenty\nTwo years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but earning Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nWithout just old and we need is just a permanent job for a mouse but actually like if you're like forty hours every week or more than that will be alert so much easier\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah\nShe's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we hadn't bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with and being able to pay off its debts\nI actually just paid off last year a car loan\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSplitting rent somebody was um the normal\nWhile city like New York Los Angeles in Seattle are mandating Fifteen dollar an hour wages the fight for Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the country will get to see how far the Fifteen dollar wage will take them I'm going out of say go for marketplace\nWe have another slice of the Amazon story on line today and explainer on monopoly sunny try saying that five times fast and why the term might relate to Amazon on Wall street retailers paying a price for the promise of higher wages we'll have details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\n\nThe new NAFTA or as it's officially now the U.S Mexico Canada agreement reached over the weekend is already raising some complaints from North of the border Canadians are worried their drug prices will go up\nThat's because one piece of the deal gives years of extended patents protection that is monopoly protection too high end expensive drugs known as biologics that means the trade deal could delay the time it takes for cheaper generic to get to market\nFrom Washington marketplaces Scott tongue reports\nBiologic drugs are complex medicine made in living cells they ... him into suppressants inflammatory perspective and very pricey this trade deal would give biologic makers ten years of patent protection Canada and Mexico which is longer than they enjoy now\nRyan popper hits action for trade representative pharmaceutical makers in others\nNot entirely up to what's in the United states but I think the industry this is a real when\nA when because it would fend off competition from generics for a few extra years then of course means a loss for makers of lower price meds noticed by a similar in Canada they'd have to wait an extra two years to get to market\nKeeping prices high school gym key on of the Canadian generic pharmaceutical association says some us biologic drugs make a billion dollars every year in Canada\nThe people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties\nSo these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansion right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect and which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some community is actually fun just most of this work themselves through local and county taxes\nAnd so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions they are used an economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is\nIs that the corps tries to see\nWhich projects can they find where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up savoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right yes\nUm so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities but something like Ninety four percent white\nAnd you found that the effect is that they're the same beaches just keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example tell me about rights bill beach\nSure right still beach had been rebuilt I think more than twenty times in its history and uh this is a community we found where you know some of the properties right along the ocean are easily worse millions of dollars\nTo leave a song she wrote about beach nourishment for Africa thank you [laughter]\n\n\n\nFall is here folks according to the calendar anyway and it's not just the leave changing color the new season signals a shift in fashion\nThis year I'm told it's all about big shoulders and slow ... boots awesome and makeup hello burgundy's plums and reds in cosmetics and skin care new formulations for cooler weather\nAs marketplaces Erica berets reports the way we buy those products is changing too and the makeup industry

use\nClimber and so you use low income where he or you try to different ones and you kind of mix everything\nThat shift from the department store beauty counter to the cosmetic supermarket has redefined the business as any free Lou she's at the center for customer insights at Yale School of management Lew said big chains likes the foreign ultra carry hundreds of brands and interacting with their sales people as like\nTalking to someone as if you know you would a friend and just getting their perspective without feeling the sense that they're being incentivized to sell their particular brand\nThat casual atmosphere is especially popular with younger shoppers and that's creating a problem for department stores that goes far beyond the makeup counter\nA lot of departments are traffic has traditionally been driven by cosmetics so if you don't have the consumer I'm going there for cosmetics and she's um she may not be going there at all\nSo Saks Fifth Avenue is trying to keep its customers by moving its beauty products off the main floor and combining them with spy services like facials an eyebrow shaping Nordstrom salespeople now handle multiple brands and Bloomingdales is
