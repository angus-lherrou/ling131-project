David lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now in the studio musician he was lamenting about how the city's changed\nThere's no steam for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos who were too strange to live in their hometown but now there's nothing left at the weirdos can afford he said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city\nThere are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park Rocco just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pose a purebred German Shepherd and the French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with her nose\nLift as New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back toward the hotel through the west village on a normal night this area's hopping but as Halloween come near it's truly outrageous the bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets\nTo me it's the adults in costume were the scariest part of Halloween at least when a child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend\n[noise]\nAnd they had a down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty humor his face painful smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused\nHe grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh\nWhat kinds of friends with people looking for where they smart zoo did they live in a magical land should I Try and return them to his hollowed out tree [laughter] and I felt bad for him so he took his base\n[laughter] I felt\nBad for him so he took his big white hand in mine and walking down the street have you ever gotten looks to strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the smart for lovers [noise]\n\nWe tried to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no ...\nThat's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for a better view the postal department might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes\nThey created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy\nBut when you get to that rounded top you quickly find out it's impossible to stand on especially if you're drunk desperate and dress like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was values you wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side frozen like a very koala bears [noise]\nI'm I've never heard alive Kuala bearing couldn't tell you what kind of noise they made this one let out little half Yeltsin runs the broke my heart\nJust as I was about to help three other smart came running up and grabbed him as long lost brothers hug them and knocked him to the ground in a pile of blue and white for I felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away\nHave you ever tried to cross the street and found yourself tackled by a gaggle of giant beer soaked stuffed animals\nThings that I come with them and get some pizza before they caught the train\nAnd the bank you\nWe went to Joe is on ... street sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with one table a couple stools at the window most people just fight through the crowd and take their slights outside I was worried about causing a scene by walking in with these murders\nBut as soon as we entered I realized\nIt was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy dabble a hotdog Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise]\nDavid rocker was right the diversity of this town is something else and it's still attracts a large amount of weirdos hey have a happy Halloween
