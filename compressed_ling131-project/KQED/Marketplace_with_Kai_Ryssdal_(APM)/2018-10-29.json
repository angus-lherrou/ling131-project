{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KQED", "content": "Problematic for public officials those our values I'm familiar with that or at the top of my head\nI think when you get you there is a really important point about a kind of\nTechnicality right we don't really want our president's skating under technicalities about how they used their power yet that's not that uncommon presidents pushing the boundaries of their power all the time\nCourse make rulings that either limit that often that doesn't right that suggests that the broad category of what executive power is encompasses all sorts of different\nPractices you know we saw a lot of that with George W. Bush and the war on terror it's not like that's new but I think it is new and as it concerns presidential conduct much of the time that we don't think of that as being related to legal technicality in that way\nWell in that goes back to what you're saying\nDid to legal technicality is in that way\nWell in that goes back to what you were saying earlier about Congress sort of dropping the ball pushing back on the president the whole concept was the three branches of government would be very concerned about their own power and so they would constantly push back against each other so when any one of them gets week we're starting to work for the others were kind of in trouble right\nI think that's right and you you know as we think about other instances where presidential conduct has been a problem making about Bill Clinton thing about Richard Nixon and both of those instances they're divided government\nAnd Congress pushed back in ways you know for Clinton to didn't and his presidency but I think you know in some way to sort of got the message of there were people that didn't approve of how he had\nConducted himself and obviously for Nixon and ultimately ended his in his presidency whether that kind of check can occur under unified government I think it's still a little bit of an open question\nBy unified government you'd be when one party controls the White House in both branches Congress\nDirect when one party controls all of it which you know may not be the situation for that much longer so we shall see\nEveryone could have something else you've talked about and that's a shift compared politics today to the political system we had an Eighteen Ninety six and you have a really interesting take on it so why don't you tell us what you mean by that [noise]\nYeah so that he came out in July of two thousand sixteen\nAnd we wrote that he's thinking about the rise of populism thinking about the concept of a of a new gilded age and thinking about very very close and very\nVocal party competition those were the things that we were really thinking about there in terms of parallels just trying its flush out the idea of is there really anything that has happened before one thing I Would say about that pieces I kinda think back on it as\nDid a lot of the conceptualization of that paper and twenty Fifteen in early twenties sixteen so I kind of cringe to think about how it does or doesn't apply after the\nElection well okay so what I was going for there was that you argue in it that in the Eighteen nineties that's well listen to president you have parties that are very evenly matched at the ballot box\nThey appear to many voters to look pretty much the same and they are incredibly vitriolic and what you suggested about that period is that in the eighties nineties is it that was the precursor to an entirely different party system\nAnd I'm Wondering if you would say the same today in two thousand in Eighteen looking at where the parties are in those particular parallels\nI thought a lot about this and a lot about the possibilities for a change in ways that are not I don't I don't know that they're totally reflected in in that piece and there are two things that I keep coming back to one is that our current situation\nIs a recipe for very stale and stagnant parties it's very difficult for the parties to change\nNegative partisanship makes the system very resistant to third parties and I know it's not normally hear from political scientist right political scientists who tell you that\nHaving electro college and single member of congressional districts majority Harry and majority rule and makes it that's why we don't have their party but third parties bubble up periodically and American history and they take up ten percent twenty percent of the vote\nIn a presidential election and they kind of\nChanged the agenda right they don't win office that they they changed the agenda and they channel new ideas and that really I think strikingly hasn't really happened in the twenty first century\nAnd one reason for that is that negative partisanship makes people terrified to cross the aisle it means that elite don't both parties at the same rate that they use to to to start new ones\nYou know that may be good or bad in various ways but I think it makes the party system very stagnant and you don't see the same possibilities for change that you did through the Eighteen nineties and then the early part of the the twentieth century you know you had different factions and in both parties that were kind of\nPushing back against it established institutional structure is pushing back against the shape of the gilded age political economy\nThings like that um that's you know kind of what I see in terms of the possibilities for change the other thing I think is that in political science we've maybe moved away from some of the theories\nThat would explain how we get out of these periods of close competition and vitriol and stagnation we used to call them ... minutes we used to say All right the new majority formed around new issues and there was this\nElection in which that happened realignment theory has kind of fallen out of favor in political science in part because when you do scrutinize those election patterns a lot of those claim start to crumble but we haven't replaced it with anything in terms of a big kind of idea about\nHow we get out of those periods so how you get from\nFrom Eighteen Ninety six to Nineteen thirty to for example\nWe've referred several times in this conversation to your colleague Jennifer Smith [noise] ah she died this past August much too young we're sorry for your loss and ours\nThank you Julia sorry thank you for being with us Julian sorry teaches political science at Marquette University and thanks for being here thank you so much\n\nThe one moment in American history that may bashed in body the principle of checks and balances is Watergate a free press the courts and Congress all acted to bring down a president to transform the White House into a criminal conspiracy\nDefinitely gage has another theory yes the Washington Post judge John ... Senator Sam urban all played important parts that she believes that the standard Watergate narrative overlooks another key player the federal bureaucracy specifically the Federal Bureau of investigation\nThe federal bureaucracy specifically the Federal Bureau of investigation Beverly gauge teaches twentieth century American political history Yale and she's the author of the new book gee man J Edgar Hoover in the American century she joined us from New haven welcome to the democracy cast\nThanks for having me well don't really it's easy to think of J Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon his political allies comrades an anti communist fervor but you argue that they were in fact in deep conflict\n[noise] they were both at the same time so they had in fact spent by the time Nixon became president spent a lifetime or at least since the late forties in a pretty close friendship and political alliance\nThat that was built as you say around anti communism and also around a kind of shared outlook about Washington so they liked each other quite a lot\nOf 'em they conspired together about all sorts of things including Hoover really supported\nNixon being elected in Nineteen sixty eight though he did it quietly but once Nixon became president they came into conflict pretty quickly\nUh one of the things Nixon really wanted to do when he came to office was what he called politicized the bureaucracy\nAh he felt that all sorts of federal civil servants were not nearly as responsive to the president as he would like them to be they didn't serve his political purposes\nAnd he really wanted to do that um unfortunately J Edgar Hoover wanted no such thing and he was a pretty powerful man at that point and that brought them into some serious conflict\nWell for himself died just before the Watergate break in right he did\nSo Hoover died in May of Nineteen Seventy two and the Watergate break in happened in June of Nineteen Seventy two\nAlready before that the FBI had had some pretty serious showdowns with the Nixon White House over some of the some of the elements that ultimately led to Watergate so for instance Nixon\nReally wanted the FBI to be doing some of his political investigating of Daniel Ellsberg for instance Hoover thought that was a very dangerous thing for the FBI to be doing he refused to do some of what makes them want it and that's actually why Nixon created his uh his famous unit known as the plumbers\nThe plumbers to stop leaks right but even Hoover was dead institution he created and had run for half a century remain behind and you focused on a man who spent Thirty years steeped in the culture of Hoover's FBI\nA man named Mark Felt who most people know as Deep Throat the man who was Bob Woodward's invaluable source in unraveling what had happened was Watergate\nSo why did a really kind of buttoned down gene man like Mark felt\nTurn on President Nixon one of\nThe I think she an unrecognized parts of the Watergate story is that it happened in the midst of a really big battle over the succession crisis at the FBI so when ... died in May of Nineteen Seventy two he\nHad been there for forty eight years as head of the FBI and that meant that there were\nCake you eat the FM San Francisco Kaye kiwi I FM north highlands Sacramento the time is four pm [noise]\nSupported by bill dot com simplifying digital business pain and science streamlining the wait three million users pay and get paid learn more and they don't come\nQuick what purple and gold and worth three billion dollars\nFrom American public media [noise]\nThis is marketplace\n\nMarketplace is supported by Amazon Web services over a million customers use ... cloud to functionality and experience to dream big and build fan [noise]\nLearn more at age ... his how dot com can die down with the investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more infidelity dot com slash ... many brokerage services announced the\nEnzyme edition online test prep for the ACT SAT G.

a big boom in space to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the place where the rubber meets the road um [noise] so what keeps you up at night\nThan what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us and and be part of what we're building and we've missed the class every year for five years\nSo this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view and brown and who quote in your coaching and Magic Johnson drove for basketball and you know ... and the other best Margaret because had the conversation on yourself about\nLook this isn't what kind of be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nAnd and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we had three coaches and three years you know and each one\nSo we had three coaches and three years you know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are marketplace all the time right you work in uncertainty and and not only does regular business here to do so to reduce the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose sports team right on target he was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground losing money oh yeah oh my God it's like\n... it it would break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother ... and I asked him how long is it going to take you to\nGet the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized that wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kid [laughter] which is all asked me\nA a word here about your family right I mean Dr both her dad during your brother who work with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book talked about it in interviews about how this was a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial read culture and says don't blow it with the family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um you know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process where the conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what your doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in your question about about making the change from prior management and your brother you study where the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was like the my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music rather Darlene ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff you know because yeah it's like these young players they there must have multitasking there used to having music\nWhile they're doing whatever let me show\nYou don't get out of your [noise] they're good to know your way around
