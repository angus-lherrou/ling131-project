companies that we buy the steel pipes say they've also increase the price but twenty five percent\nThese price hikes are getting passed directly to consumers in the form of rate increases under water bills\nSourcing about a two percent increase primarily due to the increase in our materials cost\nThe company that produces the little water purifying resin balls is called pure like itself to municipal water systems around the country that serves millions of consumers it is a U.S company but it owns a factory in China Jacob Brody is vice president he says one way to get around the tariffs would be to make the filter read them here\nTo build a new facility in the United states will cost tens of millions of dollars and take two to three years\nHis factory in China search customers all

happens so fast you might reasonably conclude we could get out of it just as fast but as marketplaces song reports game theory suggests otherwise\nGame theory is the way scientists and mathematicians think about human behavior and interaction which should I Do based on what you do should I trust you and what do I do if you break that trust\nBefore this trade war the U.S and China had some trust both remembers him free trade club known as the world Trade Organization and then trust broke down trade professor Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law says a decade ago Beijing begin requiring U.S companies there to hand over their secrets\nThey're forced technology transfer violates the commitments China made when it joined the WTO that its level of IP theft is a violation of the intellectual property provisions\nWashington meanwhile roped trust by taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO rules the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on Chinese\nGame theory suggest a couple of things one is it's hard to establish trust one is broken into a trade war is actually a rational thing for countries to do it in their self interest here's how\nNYU business process I ruined sooner origin says the U.S interest is to tax Chinese imports whether it be gene responds or not either way Washington makes money\nThat China and poses to address

trade war of self interest is actually the norm in that cooperation and free trade is the exception\nBoth countries imposing to address is ... equilibrium of the game\nTo sooner origin this means a trade war could go on a while it's been ten years now game theory does allow for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupt things said political change\nCould be the election of a new president in the United states now that unfortunately has to be coupled with a similar willingness to negotiate on China's thought\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China together and create space for trust his Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provides new customers for your exports and outside third parties will be the free trade police\nDo it's giving a little bit of political cover to China to say we need to make these reforms in order to remain a member in good
