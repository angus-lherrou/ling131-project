of character in the states of America I think we're just tearing each other for for some reasons I don't fully understand but I think most people are pretty good character but the first is character when Jay pure Morgan said that he was referring to it's not about the models of credit I always told Congress you've been up all the models you want\nBut character and culture isn't in a model and we

developing real estate next to the stadium makes a lot of sense the national football league like all the other major sports leagues has a revenue sharing agreement for its teams that covers things like TV revenues in ticket sales not real estate says Washington University's Patrick rich\nYou are able to generate significant revenue from that that you don't have to share with other teams in your sport and that's huge\nBut when a franchise built a new stadium it's often in areas that have affordable housing or at least housing options below market rate says no I got a sports economist in San

the ten year it was three point zero nine so here we are almost thirty six hours later it is a ... percent higher attempt percentage point higher what gives\n[noise] okay so generally speaking this is happening because the economy is doing great now why specifically yesterday\nI mean like it's like if you're trying to push a car out of a ditch why did it suddenly move at second you know but one reason could be that there was a very good number I asked them index of ... non manufacturers\nService industries that was near a record high yesterday\nBut generally you know you have a low unemployment three point nine percent of GDP Growth rate and revise working two percent second quarter this\nAll this great news and it just keeps on piling up and piling up\nA means that a investors could be thinking that inflation is coming okay so and if inflation is going to be actually coming we also saw a oil prices rise are rising right so the thing and pushing coming then that could eat into their long term investment and a ten year treasuries long term investments are they're going to need a higher yield the other thing\nIs that uh this could be telling us that investors believed the fed is going to ... keep on keeping on raising right right right and ... and so that influences like\nWhich is which is what your caller talked about we'll get to back that we'll get back to

gonna put this money back in the U.S that hurts those countries currencies oh case but if I had been ...\nBut if I had been living on a my savings account or interest rates and my ah certificates of deposit interest rates which for a decade now have been ... basically isn't there's admittedly small take up a sign of hope\nYeah it is yes that's right savings account or returns are going to go up that's a that's exactly right now on the other hand so is your credit card rates so is your mortgage it's not a surprise that the thirty year national average mortgage rate is also in a multi year high jump in with this ten year bond a yield so above them\nAll right uh back to Jay Powell super quick we got a half a minute I'm he sits there the chairman of the fed does and he sees the bond market reacting in the way that in theory he wants right he wants to uh he's been raising rates and he wants to this to keep picking up what do you think\nHe's been good great that's what I Want

people her workload second or third jobs as economists ... at the new school\nShe says stores no that higher wages will bring in people who need the extra income is really no such thing as a labor shortage in economics higher pay could cut into profits for retailers and make gift buying more expensive for shoppers but look these are good problems to have the national Retail Federation said holiday sales are expected to jump by more than four percent this year\nEconomists Sarah house it Wells Fargo says workers are benefiting to\nResign this week with Amazon increasing their minimum wage the target and Walmart increase the level that they're bringing in workers'\nShe says retailers could ask employees to work longer hours instead of bringing more people on that would be good for
