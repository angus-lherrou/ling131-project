of them delicious fried rice um and I love also because I Love eggs\nHuge chunks it was like just kind of like cut at once or twice and then throws it is but I Love it and then one more just that I Love to have our the on the menu what's called grilled muscles but he calls them barbecued muscles\nAnd to come to this um round a tray and then inside is just a plethora of fried garlic but I'm telling you it is so good it was on the buffet\nWhen we got a at every I average\nAbout everybody\nLoved at my fried to friends who just loved it yeah and we so we lived in Oakland before we went to the peninsula and I have a favorite Thai restaurant in Oakland so when I\nSaw this I was like I don't know it's not going to be as good as mine\nI wasn't in apprehensive and the one thing that the disappointments I'm kind of basic and that I Love chicken had tied as one of my favorite dishes and we ordered it for the kids to start with\nAnd the noodles were really machine which is odd because then when you go to the buffet they had ... noodles and they were great yeah that was like I think maybe we just got a bad order or something like that was like the one disappointment and but the yellow curry\nAt the um buffet was amazing all three of my friends and and I who went loved the yellow curry over at the rice\nWhich was ... and my daughter is again the rice both just gobbled up they kept asking can I can ... can I get another caller I think another boy that happened and I actually had a date that for that Saturday Night to go for dinner and I'm putting in the directions my GPS to

ago Randall did you sit in enough [laughter]\nI don't really know that aren't\n... which I think it was my favorite thing that I ordered it came in this like a middle bold is really interesting is like a flame in the middle of the really cool and what you're going to serve yourself out of the ball a little bit of space and a lot of flavor like everything there was so flavorful as really good\nGuys have deserved desert another favorite of mine of all time is sticky rice and so he didn't have my ankle most of the time you go there but then we also throw in coconut ice cream\nI've made a loaf of the time you go there but then we also throw in coconut ice cream so that the creamy that's in the suite of the rice mixed with that mango which is this a little bit more tropical feel is a great by on top of the ice cream what'd you could eat alone either it was so delicious but then if you have\nLike a bite of that cold cold ice cream with that in a hot button the rights of hot with it hot sticky rice it\nAt the driven I did it with the ice cream\nWith I don't go on Saturday they had a desert\nThat buffet which was a banana tapioca\nNot my favorite I'm not tapioca person probably

Christine Blasey Ford's testimony a part of the sexual assault or the cheese charged or that\nYou have a whole group on his part the whole group is in one man credibly accused by not one but three women of sexual assault and the ... the group on the other side is women saying you need to take these\nThese stories and these allegations seriously um I mean his yes he might lose his job on on the DC circuit courts um if if the country believes that he is um those credibly accused of sexual sexual assault and also revealed himself to be\nA part is in in a way that no other I'm no other justice um nominee has done before you know nobody is accused Neil Gorsuch a sexual assault no women\nKnow yell classmates no school classmates he was the same principle as Kevin ... nobody's come forward about him I'm no Democrats\nNo no I wasn't going to have sorry again I just have to repeat that in your in your statement there you have conflated to things and issue about partisanship which I think it's\nPerfectly legitimate as far as his fitness to sit on the Supreme Court but then also in an act of sexual assault which is the RAVE Act of misconduct subject to criminal penalties and I don't think you can't conflict but to honestly one and the other are very serious very significant and ...\nAnd when we begin to say okay well I Hope this guy because he has certainly judicial philosophy which I disagree but also it's probably a serial assault or\nNot and that's that's not what I said what I said is that he revealed eh eh eh he displayed a sense of partisanship different than being a conservative jurists um when he accuses some sort of Vaseline Clinton led conspiracy for trying to keep them off the bench\nThat's just that's just black helicopter talk I mean that's just crazy I'm ... and you didn't just lay the temperament and talking to you any closer sharks um you know asking her or the child is an alcoholic out drunk you know I mean this was this was not a good performance except for the audience of one for him that was intended\nAnd let me change if I may was you know are awesome because uh you you even said what the Democrats one here in your article you said as a confession and they're probably not going to get it because he has too much to lose whether he's telling the truth or not but there's a real question about his recipe and as far as it should those are real factors in this whole confirmation are they not know murder\nOr partisanship is absolutely a factor here and I suspect that Democrats have said that pretty solid ground so much to say that are a part of the judges confirmable although that would render quite a few justice has already gone to court\nBut this is my man and his regime hearings as she said I'm impartial I'm like an empire I'm like an umpire and I mean how do you balance that with the statements and strength yeah\nRight well the problem here with the idea that a justice should be impartial in the face of allegations involving its own conduct potentially criminal conduct such strikes me as an unrealistic notion that you should be nonpartisan and the fate of accusations of being involved in a gang rape\nA loop um seems can either be unrealistic to the point of denying the fact that we have recusal process I mean judges are personally involved in cases\nThey are to withdraw themselves from those cases um I and again we we conflate and the idea that the individual can serve on the court and have a partisan views which by the way it is a rather common practice with what our again criminal allegations I Do think we have to just make a giant distinction between those\nThey're not allowed to gauge it and that if you are hiring an intern and won\nMake a giant distinction between those\nTwo ... but if you were hiring an intern and one person was accused of sexual assault credibly and another was not\nYou would hire the second I mean it's not a guarantee you would go to the police on the other one uh you you got a job and you might I mean you might not have standing and you're in you know I mean I I think again to to try and say that this needs to meet a criminal trial standard\nIs crazy and that's particularly crazy if you're not willing to do a serious investigation so\nWhen he was asked when Kevin I was just a should he be interviewed by the FBI you said I uh this is a President Trump said just recently actually when I hear a cut from him I think so I think it's fine if they do that's up to them but it seems\nNo Rodman the scope of this has been somewhat limited in and really constrained\nWell according to the New York times or we don't have any evidence that this has been trained at least not by the White House and it would not be commented that were the case for for the executive branch to limit\nThe scope it which are what seven background investigation into a if a judge Kavanaugh was conducted I again we have no evidence that that is the case for those who are making that claim and all the credit by the way I'm tiered justice correspondent who said earlier I Believe\nThat the Russian that'd be perjured himself and that by the way up there with the federal to start one way or the other it's not bereft effect on the Senate will say one way or the other whether or not they believe ... district for the fact that you're just of course part of that for example that he testified that he never passed out that it's not true that I went to sleep quote unquote when he testified under oath\nThat its colloquially happening out what he started by never locked out and a lot of people have to say okay well that seems really unlikely unrealistic given what we know about his drinking history from customary for his friends are and interviews or what have you and that's perfectly natural I'm fine and the conclusion that I think I agree with\nBut that does that mean we perjured himself almost ... you're not say anything to the contrary\nI alluded to President Trump saying at a press conferences just minutes ago he was answering a question on whether the White House has imposed limits on the FBI investigation and here's what he said\nMy White House will do whatever the senators want\nI'm open to whatever they want the one thing I Want to speed now this is the seventh investigation of judge Kavanaugh number seven this is number one\nThey started on friday they worked on weekends have gone late into the evenings the FBI is really working hard\nWell they're discouraging for you I mean the president said would we just heard from\nNell Rodman seven investigations well\nI mean that is completely disingenuous because when you go through a normal background check the the as I said the sex that um that Ryan was referring to before I mean they do they call a few associates some of whose names you provide to them they they you know they do this sort of basic due diligence and if nothing pops up on their radar you know you kind of pass through your background check\nAnd you move on but as we saw with Rob Porter if something does pop up\nLike credible sexual assault claims or credible claims of domestic violence than they dig deeper so you know we can talk about whether or not judge Kavanaugh's previous background checks were sufficient but at this point we have credible\nAccusations of sexual assault credible a accusations of certainly not telling the truth to Congress and not just about drinking and the sec staff there was also you know sort of dirty tricks and other other things that he completely dissemble about 'em but you know so now we'll see if the FBI is is empowered\nTo do an actual investigation that the country desperately needs no restaurant I Want to get your response\nBut first let

Twitter handles that take it easy for him like a response when there's no rubber could I ask you first of all do a quick we've only got about a minute left her but could you just address the whole question that I brought up earlier about\nUm the the ... case it's a on the docket dumped talking about gamble versus the United states\nI I'm not sure what the digital philosophy is regarding that and he has hurt the case before him I I don't think it's appropriate to prejudge\nA case of hearing the merits of the arguments and that's probably something that I think Democrats are not going to accept they'd rather hear a philosophical opposition to what is going to people for the court but that's also not to do a do justice to the individuals who are involved in that case they're argument to me to be heard before they're determined\nAnd your thoughts about what you just heard from a from a large effort quickly\nI agree with that I think the Senate is looking for some sort of covers either have a smoking gun here's a schedule that nomination or to have a\nWreck having against cleared and that is not what they're going to be presented with senators are going to have to make the call and when they do is going to alienate millions of people on either side of this divide there were just going to be postponing the conditions that we were out of weeks ago\nI think you called it his ear on some game well we'll hear from our listeners when we return on Michael Krasny [noise]\n\n\nThere's what's coming up in our second hour this morning as part of our election twenty Eighteen coverage we need Republican candidate for California secretary of state mark moisture and a ten thirty we debate state proposition three and eight point nine billion dollar bond them\nThirty we debate state proposition three and eight point nine billion dollar bond that would son said water projects and I told her not joined me for a special lines foreign broadcast at the Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa we'll be talking about ... county residents and local leaders about how they're hoping one year after the devastating wildfires\nAnd from a conservative perspective I have to tell you the exact same thing with the conservative ... that was rent a writer by Donald Trump's presidency has been reunited in a way that I haven't seen two years\nOver the treatment of the individual and the notion that you can all somehow to get rid of him and replace him with another justice after the corruption up this process\nBy actually abandoning him and and beaming him having been a partner at that evidence suggesting that you think age in gross sexual misconduct and sexual assault\nAnd it'd be a corroborated rumors and they are absolutely are uncorroborated there is no pretty temperate corroborating witness who can say anything happened or even that they were there a band you can say okay this could happen just about anybody any allegation even back in childhood when you're a minor\nCan be found him up and eat without the evidence\nCan uh can ruin a reputation or otherwise sterling legal career and without as though that's going about establishing president bitter record right so yeah maybe a couple of weeks ago Brett Kavanaugh was a guy and they wanted him to Coney Barrett or whoever rather justice is on the federal at work but here they are dying now\nAnd it doesn't have anything to do with her judicial philosophy\nIraq movie it was a freshman in college no residents associate editor of commentary I Want to get another caller border Carolyn joined us here on the air\nYes hello Hi so taking my call\n'em so here's my point I'm ... why the White House in ... not allow a whole and unfettered investigation critics charge 'em why um why limited weren't going to select who is going to be investigated\nOh just limited to select who's going to be investigated and we're we're we're going to let the scope of this go eat what kind of have an investigation like normal people in the United states yet when they're charged with the bomb and I'm not a ... we just had a very prominent nan ... walked\nInto partisan with um a lot of on\nSubstantiated um because of the statute of limitations and not having 'em some critical evidence walked into jail why can't we have an unfettered investigation one in three of us myself included have been assaulted\nIn our lifetimes one in ... winning so I was a warning shot across conservative men spouse\nWanted three of us have signed for hearing about it\nHave bothered that I'm hearing about this happened for others have goals have grandfather had boy when I hear about this and they're taking it personal and it is not about women's sabotaging\nTitled men's careers hearing about it and their beer drinking man yeah football watching men and they are upset\nAnd they are going to hear from you as well as the women across the country thank you\nThank you for that statement or Russian response\n[laughter] yeah I I hear they're legitimate and searing pain in the voice and I believe\nHer I Believe that something happened to her and I believe that we're just at that one and three million or one in three women have suffered or this kind of in the mid ... youth and that the we're in the middle of a vital recognizing\nThat has been about the private institutions that are shielded men in powerful position from the responsibilities of treatment that should be taken for their actions from their consequences however\nIt is a grave injustice to do collective recruit beauty adjusted to a man based on the\nAllegations against other man this is about an individual and look is about a crime and by the way he has not been charged with anything\nBecause it investigation into the gentleman background yes then it could have legal exposure at the end of the river right now it is purely an investigation interviewing witnesses and the witnesses testimony for going to be presented with it that the Senate walk up or down whether or not they think of a product of evidence suggests Brett Kavanaugh in engaged in criminal activity\nNow getting getting prosecuted but it is still criminal activity and so this man and his two young daughters minors and his wife will have the reputation of permanently ruined so the stakes are very serious for these individuals and that is that that is looking at our pure cruel genuine justice for either Dr Ford\nOr rec having our and his family and that's why if you're at some game somebody is going to win here and someone is going to lose that whoever comes out of this one way or the other up or down millions of people are going to feel like that caller just felt\nWhile I'm lettering donated against women are not to be believed and that is a grave injustice\nApropos what you just said let me go to Jeffrey on this uh Roger Cohen wrote in her country might as soon as the millions of Americans saw this unfold as an upstanding middle aged judge and his family victims of gender politics and to me to revolution\nIn our land anything as Hannah that's Roger Cohen's yeah million side I mean obviously we didn't see it that way but\nA lot we write his new by millions of my idols adults you know I don't see that I see I see conservative columnist talking about that and trying to ... and the flames of that but I'm not seen some great hue and cry that I mean most men\nDo not sexually abused women and therefore they're not afraid of being\nAccused of sexually abusing women women have been around men who um you know plenty of women who have been around men who are drinking and um those men don't attack them you know [laughter]\nTo just sort of say like anybody can be accused of is just another way of saying boys will be boys this man is being accused for things that she specifically um is alleged to have done and\nWe need to look at that and I'm Sorry like it it you know on the one side there is Brett Kavanaugh and his family and his career on the other side there is not just because she last before there is\nOne in three American women who had been raped or severely sexually assaulted those women are not just Democrats and they're not just liberals and I I I think it is frankly a nominal strategic mistake for the Republican Party to\nGo down this road but you know they've been going down this road for two plus years specifically with sexual assault allegations and\nAs a result we've seen women sweep into power and son campaigns and run for office and that is just you know increase now\nLet me read or come inside and their militia should be no I just want to recover from this is a dump tells a I'm a liberal Democrat I Do not want British Kevin ought to be confirmed to the Supreme Court I Believe Dr blows me but I Am disturbed\nBy the contemptuous mockery towards Kevin seemingly since you were anguished women have always been mocked and called hysterical for showing tears in motion I don't think the contempt as any more acceptable when it's working toward a man or woman please\nYeah I Do have to say that again that the notion that you should have nothing to fear from a false allegation if you've never done anything wrong is simply a grocery list statement of the of the stakes and the threat involved here a false statement\nIt is by nature in ... in an allegation I get something that never happened so yes everybody has the resides reason to fear that and that's why we have to process in this country so that allegation fairly educated\nA dispassionate an adversarial system we do not litigate criminal allegation political\nPassionate and adversarial system we do not litigate criminal allegation political Venus because if they show trial\nAnd it was extremely unfair to everyone involved and that's not an end by the way there's not an attack on the me too movement in fact that it's in an attempt to keep the integrity of the me too movement to gather when you are attempting to make different vigil into some sort of a told them\nTo educate all the wrong that had been done to women over the course of the of the ...\nHow do you eat that many decades in which the Supreme me too movement wisdom prevailed in which men and their and bad behavior has always been gauging\nThe alliance teams lost his job unless he was criminally prosecuted for rape\nOr you think the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh or anywhere near as substantial as the against Harvey Weinstein or any of the other men were taken down\nI mean I Can't believe you are well yes if you were to take all three of these women that there were there pretty severe at their word precisely\nLike no we're not we're corroborating things that are not really true there's corroborating evidence that people were there that she's given statements that have been um in part wishy\nWashy Ford Dr Ford own best friend testified that she cannot corroborate her through evidence and then Dr Ford that well my best friend is experience of health issues going after her credibility\nShe's not interested since her best friend she said it was a girl that she happened to be at the party\nWhen you know there was certainly very disturbing about the whole sequence no because uh in Canada and I wonder if you can see just point to know rather than uh\nJust kept saying oh they I mean essentially they said they didn't remember but he said they can't leave the EU gave every indication that he believed and offered forward so many and almost as evidence that it never took place\nEven use the words that seem to suggest that they had said that and that was certainly not the ... judging they had no memory of this\nAs far as I understand that we don't have any evidence that make the back yard flooded turn up something we don't know and\nFrankly I Do think there is an FBI role here unfortunately I suspect that's going to be ... it's not going to be a substantial enough for either side could to to take away the definitive conclusion from it but I Do think that there is a role here however\n\nYou're listening to a forum on cake you weighty up in San Francisco or on ... north highlands which ...

Internet providers from blocking are slowing down or speeding I pay for the people's access to their website but actually no further than the Obama era rules and that they offer prohibit a packet of zero rating\nWhich is when a say like a cell phone company or an Internet company allowed free access to a certain services as part of your plan that they are by disadvantage and others\nWill and the department of justice has already sued California or these different grounds we're talking about in terms of the suit as we said earlier attorney general sessions said uh they frustrate federal policy\nFor the federal government is doing how far have because in the new network neutrality lives that were\nThat finally put on the books that summer there to prevent in that ... states ability to regulate the Internet and the way that would restore the old net neutrality alive and fashion is saying that this is a violation of that preemption applies\nAnd he's also pointing out that if California created though network neutrality live that it's going to be really difficult because the Internet a border with got separate Internet for California\nAnd the rest of the country and we could have a situation where we have a ball and Internet\nYeah you wonder how this was going to be implemented I mean frankly uh there's been criticism to says it's a well made of states each making their own net neutrality laws if that happens is it's kind of a patchwork system doesn't that this will be hard to implement\n[laughter] well what what happened was likely is that they either people here to California alive and it would\nKind of cover the entire country that have happened before with California policy like for instance part of the policies that we see on Web sites that are adults that California lot path into that and three that in effect create a privacy policies across the entire Internet because it could create a separate law for California\nNow other than they're probably going to want to have a lot of the California gets to kill and that's where the trouble lies and you know really crowded incredibly important in California and you realize that's probably more than any other state because of the concentration of the technology industry in this day\nHack those databases or to really talking about modernization basically well modernization as one term that you could use but yes we are really the last effect of modernization of this office was when bill Jones with\nSecretary of state back from what was at a Ninety four to two thousand and two\nWe're talking if you just joined us is mark Morris or he is a candidate for secretary of state and the Republican candidate will talk later on in this election season probably with his rival Elisha ... who I think he referred to as a politician looking for another physician or something along those lines but uh\nI like to hear from you our listeners questions about uh not only the secretary of state what they do and they do a lot but the kind of ideas you hearing my voice you're putting forward here as a candidate and any response you have or any question you have certainly welcome and you can join us now at our toll free number\nAnd we're going to give me doing this up until ten thirty so if you'd like to ask the candidate a question or say something to him now would be the time to put in your

or go to our website and post any questions or comments you have their\n... dot org slash forum and click on the segment or tweet us our Twitter handle is at stake too easy for him you've also said you want to get more voters registered and that's always been the position of secretary of state candidate but he has done a lot on that score has an air is not done enough in your judgment\nWell he has done a lot but the the one of the problems that we see with how he's been doing it is through the DMV he didn't properly make sure that the tobacco databases\nWere matching and so what we've seen is a lot of problems where Seventy eight thousand Californians had their voter registration changed without their consent you said that in fact I think there are regular each of them is that what you meant yes there's a lot of irregularities we've got you know just about a month ago twenty three thousand people\nA ended up being registered with improper information or we're not supposed to be registered to vote or\nWe just learned a week and a half ago another three thousand on the DMV\nI've talked to people who\nThey were you know their business registered a car and then all of a sudden their personal voter registration was changed to their business address and when they went to go become a candidate for city council and they were told they worked in the\nProper district so there's been a lot of problems because the secretary of state did not make sure that the databases work properly communicating between DMV and the secretary of state\nYou know and I it doesn't appear like the DMV employees were properly trained they are not properly trained to be voted registrars and the secretary of state doesn't seem to be doing the job properly\nVerifying what the DMV is doing and so it has created a lot of concern among voters up and down the state with the problems that have been created over the last four months with a voter registrations\nAnd you also have said that you think that California is needed a new registration process for businesses what does that mean in your judgment\nLawyer that business registration ah\nIn your judgment wire that business registration ah right now it takes about three weeks to register your a business and you pretty much have to have a an attorney go do the process for you whereas in Nevada you know it takes ten minutes you type a couple of things up on the website and your businesses registered\nA three week Senate attorney versus ten minutes on the computer is not very business friendly I mean here in the state of California we have a franchise tax\nA bill of about a hundred dollars that goes to every businesses we need to make it as easy as possible for these entrepreneur or to register so that way they can start paying that are\nAttacks but you know the thing is\nIs just again you use the term modernization earlier or the registration process for a business in the state of California\nIt's like we're living in the Pony Express days while the train is just passing by and it's just needs to we need to do some major changes in updates ...\nIs our guest is a candidate for secretary of state and our first Keller and colors firm believers Susan you're on the air good morning\nOr good morning I'm just to comment on voter fraud ah\nI noticed um your speaker a folk of northern states but it's really happening either had to have more and they're with an organization respected organization I'm Sorry I don't know the name of it I guess it's weak raise a billion with a the vote\nAnd found thirty one project my vote\nSo it doesn't mean we shouldn't be modernizing it just means it's not a huge issue and voting a huge issue is restricting voters that's a huge issue and it and that's how\nYou know Susan's point is certainly one has been made a over and over again that it it's it's not a a very fragile and voting is not really a great problem in terms of verifiable or in controversial cases in\nThe south is a big problem many people have written about you know southern black voters being denied voting and so forth but in California specifically are we talking about a major problem in your judgment\nWell I'm going to first say that there are there in recent years has been nine hundred and Ninety two convictions\nOf election law fraud um nationally nationally yeah or the specifically in California well in the last week alone I have been going around the state\nAnd I have done six different Facebook lives at\nBusinesses that have a large number of registered voters one was thirty one registered voters in front of a check cashing store and I'm an election law attorney in the election law says that you can only be registering to vote at your residence having thirty one people registered to vote at a check cashing store\nMeans that those are fraudulent registrations yesterday is Eighteen registered voters at the California state fair and so\nThe thing is if you're not investigating if you're not auditing you're not going to get convictions um I you know there we know that in California the main source of data\nFor voter for jury service summons comes from our voter rolls\nAnd we know that the jury service ... over five percent of those come back as somebody saying that they're not us learn under penalty of perjury that they're not assist in the United states that\nVery well could mean that we have a million people who are not eligible to vote who are on our voter rolls and why that is important\nIs because if they vote they can be deported\nAnd citizenship denied for life like happened to a priest just two weeks ago he he cast one vote because he was mistakenly put on the voter rolls\nHe was sent ballot materials by the state and he voted and now he's being deported because he cast that one vote and so we as the secretary of state need to do our job of at that under federal law state law in the United States Supreme court has said that the secretary state has a duty\nTo maintain the voter rolls and we're creating victims of these non citizens\nAre we've got ... seconds left her I Want to get another caller and her and that you are than good morning you're on the air\nGood morning I wanted to ask what the um kittens ... wives aren't changing California to wait for it and vote which is a paper I'm male and\nWell that is something that the legislature has to do if you're a legislature that passes laws I'm more like your share of your sheriff enforces the law and the secretary of state is the one who's supposed to enforce the law so that would be a legislative\nDecision odd that would be made and if the legislature moved to an all mail in ballot as in I Would be in charge of making sure that that happens and the thing is we are moving that way at a very rapid rate I mean if we're looking at probably close to fifty percent of the ballots are this election bean mail and\nSo we have our ... is a candidate for the secretary of state position Rix says when you hear that the state prohibits voter audits what does a person think will happen this was a typically bureaucratic failure any candidate that gets out there bused in sees every county gets my vote\nThank you Mark Mehos you're good thanks for having us when we return we're going to talk about proposition as three is on your state ballot and it is a pretty controversial

five three three three zero zero [noise]\nI don't see that anybody's being hit at a gas ... year this this bond measure has broad support because of all the benefits that it provides and one thing I'm stunned that is that you know with all the\nTalk about climate change or the appreciation of the need for urgent action\nHas been lacking and that's why it's so important to pass this bond now and start making these changes in our state wide water system so that local communities have more sustainable water supplies and safe and clean water supplies for example this bond invests in water recycling and in a disseminating\nGroundwater so that it can be used and you know when the next drought hits which we'll we're going to need to be more reliant on local sources of water without harming the environment and this bond measure puts no money into new dams or canals puts no money into the tunnels and the delta\nAnd it's a great investment and it's an urgent one\nLet me go back to you Ron store canoe here from our listeners a Governor Brown by the way is remain neutral on this but uh [noise] run store what about all the good that we're hearing about from David Lewis\nTheir projects in this bond that are married tore us and that I Am personally in favor of but once again you've got to ...\nPersonally in favor of but once again you've got to practice some elementary hygiene on on what projects are being benefited and this bond is clearly failing we have\nThe San Diego a Tribune and the Orange County register the San Francisco chronicle the San jose Mercury News in East Bay times Sacramento Bee in Santa Cruz sentimental already opposing this bond so uh\nAnd again the Sacramento area is a good example because of of what I said before in a like a likely to finish your sins but like they have to go back to this with with you David Lewis in a moment that are there other projects that are that need money more ... go ahead please if he would run store\nWhen I was just saying that that clearly a this bond is um [noise]\nEncountering some resistance because their projects in this bond or features of this bond that are a unfortunate and I really don't belong in these bonds and unfortunately David his groups are essentially being held hostage by the fact that I'm like\nYou arrive oriented or could you blink your objects and nobody's holding us hostage I say the bay has a spotless record of supporting environmentally beneficial measures both locally\nAnd state wide and uh we wouldn't support this bond if it weren't urgent and beneficial for all Californians and especially for people in the bay area and there's massive support for this measure here in the bay area everyone from San jose mayor Sam a cart up to the entire San Francisco board of supervisors\nMembers of the state legislature from Nancy Skinner to Scott Wiener and this is broadly supported and it should be by all voters and the money\nThat the argument that it could be used for things that are far more needed in\nThis day well in fact last year when the legislature was discussion park and water bonds all these ... urgent water needs weren't on the table and the legislature did appropriate four billion dollars but most of that was not for water needs or for water purposes it was for very urgent park needs\nSo there's a there's a long track record of citizens initiatives including many that the Sierra Club\nHas supported for these kinds of projects brought fifty prop eighty four and in past years and I think the people in this case are actually ahead of the leaders on recognizing the urgency of climate change the threat from drought\nAnd either need to include a these kinds of expenditures for a safe and secure water supply for everyone in California\nWas dark I mentioned the raising of money by the pro supporters of prop ... uh we're we're so ... is their opposition money coming in\n[noise] you know this is a widely known as the pay to play measure and and it's quite an advantage to um ... water districts urban water districts that get 'em and their customers\nThat get a taxpayer money um flowing into their coffers for projects that otherwise would be paid for by the beneficiaries All right\nLet me bring our listeners into this and I know many of you want to weigh in on it and have questions and so this is an opportunity right at

and we'll take about this is a figure David Lewis I'm going to go to you with\nFour hundred and thirty million a year for forty years to pay them off and go\nBack to the taxpayers yeah well in addition to all the uh elected officials support the support from leading environmental organizations it's pretty striking to see who doesn't oppose this measure it Howard Jarvis taxpayers association\nIs usually considered the gold standard by those who oppose expenditures by the state and they are not opposing this measure\nThe Howard Jarvis taxpayers association has not opposed to this measure\nSo that I think goes a long way to telling you that even a fiscal conservatives are mostly not opposing this measure as a legitimate expense for the state to invest in urgent needs for clean reliable water for people for businesses and also for the environment\nBut that was standing in the harbor Howard Jarvis a tax association a I think you're saying aren't you run store that ah there's too much of this money to cook come from other sources\nThat's correct these are obligations of the state and federal water contractors in some cases in many cases and um it is interestingly enough a taxpayer group that made the ballot argument I'm against proposition three on them on your balance that you'll be receiving\nRun would you agree with a question from rusty one of our listeners says the legislature failed to pass a bill to provide safe drinking water to disadvantaged communities this year prop three seems to be the only alternative you agree [noise]\nAh the legislature is passing bills and there's bond money that's flowing into um these communities in\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford ... to\n... help communities in the San Joaquin Valley with bad drinking water\nYou know before I go to our calls let me go back to David Lewis bill says David ducks unlimited is not a traditional environmental organization as uh the wealthiest animal ... conservation organization in the country it's primary purpose is to make sure the duck hunters have plenty of ducks to kill\nYou out of the primary first the ducks unlimited in a in the San Francisco bay area they've been leading advocate and actually practitioner of restoring tidal marshes in San Francisco bay not primarily for hunting but for recovery of a fish wildlife and endangered birds\nAnd just back to Ron's point I just I think it's naive\nTo say that there's been enough investment in clean water and in disadvantaged communities\nAnd this bond has hundreds of millions of dollars for wastewater recycling for groundwater desalination for urban water conservation ... I'm for ground water recharge all things that the legislature failed to provide\nWe should also mention ah because we have many listeners north of us here that um we're talking in this whole package with the free and current canal for example\nWhich has gone through serious damage of sinking I mean split about sixty percent as well the yeah the middle of the canal is a sunk so low that the amount of water that can be moved through it without basically poring over the side has been reduced and we talked about some of the reasons that so important not just to\nDisadvantaged communities that rely on that canal for drinking water but for agriculture for food that we all eat an all benefit from having here in the state\nAnd also to recharge groundwater in the Central Valley in wet years when there's enough\nBut this does help the pistachio growers another agribusiness groups I mean there's no\nDenying that is if you know I ... I think that the the bond is a very explicit about what the purpose is Iran has one particular beef with one particular project and I think it's because of old antipathy between uh the Sierra Club and\nThat particular water district that's not a reason to oppose it don't these important investments that go all over the state yeah Ron store\nI don't think I don't think we oppose those investments at all um those investments are in a federal water project um are the responsibility of the federal government and the federal water contractors to pay for\nTo make these um [noise] I'm taxpayer revenues from the state of California available to them is is one of the more amazing things in this bar", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "01"}
