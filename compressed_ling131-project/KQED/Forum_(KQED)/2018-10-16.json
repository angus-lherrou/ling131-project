warriors flip the Cleveland Cavaliers to win a third NBA championship in four years\nCan the dubs do it again you know the team opens this new season on Tuesday and fans have pretty good reasons to be optimistic started occurring clay Thompson dream in green and the finals MVP Kevin Durant are all returning this year and the team is that the fist all started to mark his cousins to the roster\nToday an form we're going to have a quick preview of what we can expect this season the team's last one in Oakland before moving to San Francisco next year and here to help us in Studio ... on the hill co host with great papa afternoon delight on Ninety five point seven the game on the good to have you with us welcome\nGood morning America to be back on her\nGlad to have you and also go to Jim burn it TV analyst with the Golden State warriors welcome Jim\nThank you Michael and nice to hear your voice bother you as well to be\nWell let's start off with a lot of the U.S repeat for these five all stars are still the team to be I think\nYeah absolutely and I walk fans to really I think they can agree with this to really enjoy what we're seeing here in the bay area I mean is franchised with the proper for so long you know struggling to get into the playoffs and now they have you know as you mentioned off the top Michael for all stars and they got the markets cousins\nAnd went to be in the last year in Oakland, California I'm just to go out in an article off with the bank and what we're seeing here today it's\nIt's something special something that we haven't seen in a long long time you talk about Jordan bulls repeating Kobe and Shaq repeating the show prime Lakers never repeated bird and the Celtics were repeated ... something like that you know for a long time so this team has a chance to win for titles or five years in stead of worried about everything you know off\nThe court and what's gonna happen the off season just enjoy the season because these guys are truly special\nYeah it's funny you mentioned the Celtics Bruce Jenkins you might have seen it had a column in the chronicle re said this is not necessarily a better team than eighty five eighty six uh Celtics which many would argue with particularly here in the bay area in\nA gym but many here in the beer and of course are very devoted fans but there are people who loves his team will beyond the bay area because of its spirit and because of his attitude and not because it is a great team I'm Wondering are well first of all you're also probably uh at this point prognosticators let's repeat another victory season\nWell that's certainly the goal and anything less will be a disappointment no matter how the regular season goes on they got a high standard they set the high standard and they compete yeah within themselves for that kind of thing they've got a lot of pride that garbage they got a lot of talent\nSeason because they're truly about to embark on a quest that's that is truly special with repeat they could possibly want to repeat which hasn't been done in a long time\nAnd let's hear from you our listeners when we begin with you the mourning\nMourning thank you um you know we have wonderful quality players as people and players but I think we ought to take our hats off to the ownership is well in this day and age where everybody as an owner is trying to get the cities in the states to build their uh facilities for them they put it in their own facility they've taken care of everything\nAnd yes they did move from Oakland but remember that they came to San Francisco in the first place and moved to Oakland for at least this thing in the bay area\nWhen I thank you for that call was the right to another call and if you want to join us need six six seven three three six six Steve from Oakland Steve you're on\nHey up between eighth graders lawyer hum I I I Know the check to check that could have stopped Oregon at this point it's necessary I just I just feel like like they've been here for so long as it's blue collar mistake that's been built\nAnd when they go to the corporate San Francisco you're gonna get than that probably won't sell to the middle of the second quarter lead to the end of the third maybe pay attention to three minutes\nIt's going to lose its magic and and and you can look at the forty niners living elite I look at the giant candlestick and it's just a whole different sued and that magic is going to be gone I'm afraid\nYou agree with that ...\nI I don't know if I necessarily agree with that and now let's look at the forty niners for example they moved forty to fifty miles down south to Silicon Valley to a place where it's tough to get to Santa Clara by great America there's not much around there so that was kind of expect that what's going on down there Levis and plus the forty niners habit one yet Levi stadium\nSo let's see if when when they have a couple of winning seasons let's see how the environment changes after the giants they need a new stadium I think Eighteen the park has been an absolute home run they were getting ten to Fifteen thousand a night at Candlestick Park and now you see at AT and T even when they're down there getting thirty thirty five thousand fans and it's a great part\nBy the water you see mission bay rubber mission bay before Eighteen park there's really nothing down there you drive down Embarcadero it was just water now you see all the bars you\nSee you know you have condos you have everything so I disagree on the part with the giants as well and now the lawyers\nLook let's be honest there will be some blue collar fans get priced out of the chase center I'm it's gonna be tough for a lot of East Bay residents to cross that bridge at that time\nTo get over to the chase center however I liked the location of the chase and you're right down the street from Eighteen to park\nAgain a lot of things to do around the Trade Center um we'll see and especially if they come in to that building and they open that building would Steph\nCurry clay Thompson dream on a camera to rent fans will still want to come and and so as the previous caller alluded to um they did start in San Francisco at the cow palace it's the bay area's team I think the warriors it'd be just find that to chase center\nWell I'm Wondering ah your response to something that ... says about the movie said the team is especially motivated to win and then the third time because they feel they owe it to want to certainly give it to the fans who have been there for them\nAnd there's no doubt oracle arena I mean you talk about all the dog that long years or that they have from the mid nineties out a way to two thousand seven with the we believe team and then once that team was broken apart it was back to the old dog days with the Golden State warriors where they're winning twenty to twenty five\nWas broken apart it was back to the old dog days with the go to State Warriors where they're winning twenty to twenty five games and the fans are oracle\nThey created a home court advantage that's you know that's not rivaled anywhere around the NBA unless you look at Oklahoma City a place like that but or color in it has been special to a lot of these guys these guys grow up in that building is definitely going to be tough and I and I know that motivating factor for talking to Steph Curry you know where he goes out there for ... going warm ups and everybody's standard\nAround the court all the kids with their Steph Curry jerseys on taking pictures and of course his fame tunnel shot people working in this that or I'm going to miss that at oracle arena\nIt's you know it's where we all grew up here to bay area so I definitely think the lawyers will be motivated not to lose too many home games this year and I was one one point Michael\n... last year and you talk about the lackadaisical regular season I have to go to stay where is that\nThey want fifty eight games but they they arrested a lot of guys at home a lot of stores or at home or member one particular home stand where Kevin to rent it and even play so I think we can stick Steve criticize arrest as players it'll be on the road because he wants to start to play it oracle and this last in the last year in a building\nCurtis wants to know well he says the rockets could have beat the guns in the playoffs last year a hundred to two teams match up this year\n... and still be a tough match up you have to wonder\nWhat the loss of Lou combine Lew Che and Trump are reserved for the ... rockets they gave him real toughness now you bring a Carmelo Anthony who's on the downside of his career Houston's motivated but I felt like we saw the best if used in last year and when Chris Paul went down with an injury that definitely change the series but\nOn the flip side Michael Andrea dollar getting injured and gained over for\nIt and they're missing them you know the rest of the series basically that really change the serious or to go to State Warriors people forget how important Andrea dollars to the Golden State warriors especially when they're closing a game and he's playing there with Kevin ... the other star so of Houston will be there\nI said watch for the Lakers with LeBron James he is a difference maker in Oklahoma City with Russell Westbrook apologize I think those three teams will give away as big trouble in the western conference\nWell here's a listener who writes the question is not as a warrior is good enough to win again they certainly are the question is does anyone else good enough to beat them Houston almost wasn't a fully healthy Boston might have been\nHouston is worse than they were last year at least in terms of what it takes to beat the warriors only a healthy Celtics wants to compete with the warriors fully healthy with cousins the warriors are unbeatable\nYeah that that listeners on to something here uh the Celtics are primed do you look at their team from top to bottom they have a local product in jail and brown who went to Cal Berkeley for season adjacent Tatum wants a rookie last year he looks like an all star ready and of course Kyrie Irving Gordon Hayward and they have our corporate they are\nDeep uh Brad Stevens to hit close to the Boston\nCeltics as one of the best coaches and the NBA and they'd given the warriors trouble over the last three or four seasons they've won a couple of games that oracle arena that gets Steph Curry a clay tops and they'd be pretty good their styles match\nOr last year I Believe the aggregate score was even a if I if I recall it was one Ninety seven one Ninety seven if you took both matchups an added up the score so\nKyrie Irving we know what he did and Tony sixteen\nAgainst everyone he hit that big time three pointer over Steph Curry the Celtics are coming there going to be a problem and if the warriors meet them in the finals I'll tell you you may have to pack your terms Michael it'd be a tough series but I think the way you're still have enough to get past the Celtics but I look at the Celtics\nAs the toughest challenge and unfortunately those two teams are only play twice in the regular season this year\nNo Mike wants to know directly to the worst be worried about the Lakers with LeBron\nI don't think so uh I you know LeBron James is a tough player they have a lot of young talent Brennan Ingram Alonzo ball towel ... their deep I still think they're a year away um but ... the Lakers or be there I I\nPersonally I have the Lakers go to the western conference finals um I don't ... especially if they end up on the opposite side of the bracket as it goes to state wars because were brawn James is that good he's that much of a difference maker he's against it but there's no doubt about it but I Believe the Lakers are still about a year away from catching the Golden State warriors\nWho got on the hill with us see again as co host of the top of that thing in the light it's a Ninety five points in the game and he's a sportswriter for the San Francisco salmon or can you give us a preview of Tuesday's game\nYes Oklahoma City uh I Believe Russell Westbrook uh fortunately or unfortunately will not playing this game he at arco Scott the surgery a little less than a month ago a I don't even believe he's going to travel with the Oklahoma City thunder warriors if for all you gambling experts out there to favor by twelve it is rainy night the lawyers have lost their last\nSeason openers I got blown out two years ago by the San Antonio spurs and covered Iran's first game with the Golden State warriors\nAnd then last season it gets used in where they lost that game a during my green got hurt and third quarter they blow double digit lead acting this time around\nThe last season opener at oracle arena I Believe the warriors will roll and be want to know to start the season\nAnd here's Danny who says the warriors head performance therapist Chelsea lane left to run the Atlanta Hawks now how this team handling the loss and how would they keep curry healthy\nYeah see that's a funny one Chelsea laid and went to Atlanta a lot of people have made a big\nDeal to fans love Chelsea later the players left Chelsea laid a I the Damon slipping me I who who the new head of performance trainer is but you always have to worry about stuff step curries angles um there are a little flimsy but watching him in the pre season a ... and I know his personal trainer personally rented pain\nFrom celery basketball they had one of the best all seasons curries ever had he got the rest a little bit then he went on his world toward a in Southeast Asia but he looks fresh she looks explosive or the ankles or right now are\nAre in the best shape they've ever been and so it's always you know tell the language really good with his ankles and that's a little wait and see deal but I think the lawyers are in good hands with their with their training staff that some of the best in the world\nThey've got this expert on keeping people ah who are going up there in their thirties to be young dismiss these people are getting a dollar in Livingston but ah it's going to be an exciting season I'm sure in

Californians including sixty one percent of renters reporting the cost of housing places a financial strain on them and their families\nThis November California voters will decide on several measures that address housing\nThis morning on foreign we're going to take a closer look at two of these ballot measures propositions one and two when we're going to start with opposition to which\nIf it passes would divert some of the revenue made from Texas imposed on millionaires they currently funds mental health services to finance a two billion dollar bond for homeless housing and mental health programs and we're going to hear from both sides on that but first\nWe're going to hear from our own guy measure righty who's here in Studio ... California politics and government desk reporter welcome guy you're born in Michael the morning to you well we have to go back here don't we took our position sixty three back in two thousand four to understand\nThat is right that that's really where it starts I mean this was money a millionaires tax or that California voters approve back in two thousand and four I'm too you know direct money towards mental health services and lawmakers are working under the idea of housing first approach wanting to get supportive housing the idea basically being\nIf you house homeless California's it's much easier to provide services\nThey wanted to redirect the money to actually building supportive housing that hit some legal road blocks that wasn't the intended original purpose of the money so basically what proposition to is asking is if\nA California you can go ahead with this idea of using some of the millionaires tax money\nTo actually build a supportive housing and if you change a ballot initiative you have to have public support exactly you have to go back to the voters once again so that's that's what kind of on the table and I think what separates this from other bond measures including one we'll be talking about uh later on proposition one is the fact that this is not new money does not money that's going to be\nComing out of the general find if it's money that has already has an existing purpose which is going to count needs to fund mental health services\nIt's redirecting a portion of that I'm actually built supportive housing\nAnd if you by the way went away on on a proposition to we are certainly inviting you to do that in fact before we meet the two are taking different sides on that and let me give you the phone number and tell you how you can be part of this hour you can join us by phone at eight six six seven three three six seven eight six and we do welcome your involvement in the program so\nFeel free to participate again it's eight six six seven three three six seven eight six you can also email your thoughts are your questions for them at ... dot org as we continue our election coverage or go to our website ... dot org slash forum or tweet us our Twitter handle is ...

Congress to county fought for the sighting of this facility\nBut it also requires resources and we don't have nearly enough or you know I just want to make one point if I may [noise]\nAgain I after this attack back in two thousand and four and I can tell you that combating homelessness [laughter] was one of the central motivations for why we did this now prop sixty three it's helped a lot of people\n[laughter] eighty thousand or so this full service partnerships that risk routers talked about where people are materialistic have gotten the wraparound services that they need [laughter] but I Can't say that\nThe act or anything frankly has made enough of it Dan homelessness in California and we need housing resources combined with services to help the thousands of people that are suffering and this will help billions of dollars will help\nBut let me get some callers on Harry James you first up good morning\nGuys thanks for taking my call I just wanted a clarification is this just normal apartment housing put people in that building like housing and treatment facilities back together like a ... survey thing\nYeah can you help us clarify guy yeah sure so\nI mean supportive housing basically your units that have those\nNot housing alone the housing we're for the services that the requirement of the act I mean you have to provide the services and by the way you have to deliver services for Twenty years ago they found a great investment for California law how can the thousands\nWill now it's up to the voters want to say a final words usually ... seconds\nYeah housing advocates I wind housing for those with mental illness they need to be dying in a way that would produce a positive outcome so family members should always be included when you're making decisions about what it would look\nWe're getting some strange noises here are are you also saying though that this will eventually maybe hit the pocket book in other ways higher property taxes for example\nWell it's hard to raise property taxes are Michael because prop Thirteen but you'd probably see it as another increase and personal income tax which is about the only place you really have some flexibility but one percent of our population is paying about ... percent of the personal income tax\nAnd we don't need to give them another incentive to move I live in a district that has a lot of high network people when they're telling me that they've bought on your arm in Florida I'm starting to get a little nervous about a revenue\nElection twenty Eighteen coverage we're talking about proposition to if you would like to weigh in I'd like to invite you to join us or we will use revenue from the millionaires tax essentially to\nFund or you know that's the last segment we would actually authorize four billion dollars in bonds for affordable housing and if you would like to weigh in please feel free to join us now I'm going to give you the phone number is eight six six seven three three six seven eight six we would like to hear from you hear your thoughts and hear your questions\nAgain eight six six seven three three six seven eight six you can also join us by emailing us forum at ... dot org or go to our website and post questions or comments there is ... orange slash forum click on the segment or tweet us our Twitter handle is that you do for them and let me go\nClick on a segment or tweet us our Twitter handle is that you do for them and let me go back to at least among the ... you heard the concerns of the the senator and you say what\nSo I I respect that there's issues with debt but I really feel like we don't really have a choice we have tried now for ten years to do exactly what the senator suggested which has asked the state to give US dollars every year\nAnd we haven't wanted to set aside annual ... signed general fund obligations for housing so we're playing the hand were Dallas and bond who have been very successful in the state we've had two previous housing bonds\nThat generate more than two billion dollars each and they they generated a significant amount of affordable housing so I think we just have to look at this as a long term investment in along to her to resource the thing I Would point out about bonds and housing\nIs that the state when they invest in housing restricts the affordability the housing for fifty five years so these are long term permanently affordable homes and so\nThis is what we have and this is a huge opportunity for us and we really feel like\nWe'd be happy if the legislature would set aside two billion dollars a year for this problem but I don't think they're going to go there and I think bonds are really the place we have to go\nBefore we hear from the senator and our listeners let me go back to a guy ... who's a reporter was ... California politics and government does go what are we in debt for now a bonded ... about Seventy five billion or so\nYeah that's right and I think you know that's that's been one of the concerns as you heard from Senator more lock a firm on the GOP side the other thing that you mentioned was this idea that you know\nIn this measure alone proposition one we're not changing any housing regulations were not you know reforming sequel we're not making it easier for builders to build I Would say the counterpoint to that is if you remember proposition one originated as Senate bill three part of that housing package which did include major changes to the laws regulating how development happens in the state\nHas to be thirty five was part of that package which basically made it harder for you know cities and counties to block housing if they haven't built enough housing in the past so I think that's kind of the picture you're hearing from supporters is this isn't just money alone this is part of a larger solution that the legislature crafted um to get at you know the things that we both know that\nYou know to solve this housing crisis we need more money and changes to you know how we develop housing\nPull back from you senator and let me actually um talk something into a get your response to and that is my ... a listener who has put forward this question center more luck she asked directly you how can you justify not supporting this measure when you have a homelessness issue in the region formerly\nA bad guy I'm Michael I was the joint author of Senate bill twelve oaks fix the no place like home I'm Bill along with senator Kevin do your own so we can show that Republicans and Democrats can work together\nA been a big advocate for providing immediate housing or was was supportive services for the homeless\nAnd the mentally ill for a long time if you go back and looked at my record of a supervisor and as a senator so I'm a big supporter of proposition to what you discovered but it has an existing income stream that is being secure guys and that's the mental health services act\nProposition one has no existing stream so you're going to have to figure out how to make those bond payments and you look at the state treasurer website already paying close to three hundred and Seventy million this year\nOn just get service for previous housing bill bonds so I guess you know I'm a Republican who's trying to at least a find solutions\nBut we're in the minority so you kinda have to ask my counterparts I mean it was hardly auto why they haven't put more money into the budget every year especially now when we have twelve billion we've got to pay cash and then you don't have to pay double almost double the cost\nOf the debt because most bonds especially in a rising interest rate environment you're going to pay the principal and and the amount of interest is about the same so to say it six billion you might be a very very I'm\nOptimistic number probably more than a billion when you're done paying this thing off\nWell let's bring our colors in here and remind you that we are talking about proposition one which was authorized four billion in bonds for affordable housing and uh let's hear first from a listener in Santa Rosa Laurie Lynn Good morning you're on the air\nHi good morning thanks so much and I'm calling because here in Santa Rosa were really invest it in and viable solution to the housing issue and so I was wondering if Lyndon ... test a little bit about why state bonds are needed to build affordable housing and why that's the best way to build housing and then the\nWell the cat in Santa Rosa the cost of building housing here in the bay area and you can't just build it and pay for it with the rents that you charge to to tenants who pay affordable rent so they pay between five hundred and twelve hundred dollars a month and that's not enough to support the total cost of building that housing so the state bonds that are really important because they will help\nThe city of Santa Rosa and actually all us in the county leverage all of the measures that they're taking locally says Santa Rosa itself has a bond issue that's going onto the ballot this will help leverage those dollars and make them go further so I think this state line is really important to the rebuilding a prospect Santa Rosa is looking at\nNow let me ask you a guy I mean we're talking about general obligation bonds for affordable housing with this ... includes loans includes grants that includes a well housing loans for veterans yeah\nYeah I mean that's a good point so the the actual bonds or we'd have to be the three billion would have to be repaid did the general fund but that one billion set aside for veteran home loans is actually paid for by itself through the program so it's the homeowners that are paying that back and that's part of it is not going to be taken um you know out of the general fund and years to come\nMore of our callers and let me go next to San jose welcome David\nAround the state lawmakers and the way that they tax housing buses commercial property that all of the local municipalities are interested in hearing from Ashville and think of it\nInterested in hearing from actual the housing and state law I guess you have a stake in first before voting age about on that you created will\nI raise property taxes before what do you think Missouri\nUh well I Am not confident that state lawmakers will take that up but voters might actually I think that's going to be something that's possibly on the twenty twenty ballot a kind of an idea to do a split role of of prop Thirteen basically to allow greater assessments on commercial property's\nKind of you know getting to what the caller was was pointing out which is that the incentive is for cities to allow commercial properties rather than develop a housing\nAnd I'm going to readers listener come in here I Want you to a response Lynda ... says please vote no on proposition one California taxpayers cannot afford to repay another four billion dollars plus interest we should be budgeting from our generals on not drastically increasing the bond repayments burden for all Californians\nWell we're not\nRaising taxes to pay for this we're simply paying for the monies that are budgeted going forward for California and I would point out that one of the biggest proponents of this bond issue and she was the treasurer of California not known for his wild a\nSpending ways I Want it eight bill he wanted ... billion exactly and so I Would suggest that that we have a problem that here now and if we wait for the legislature to revise prop Thirteen or do something that\nIs you know Thirty years in the making we're not going to get there and we have a current problem and we have the opportunity to solve that problem with a four billion dollar investment and that's a big\nIt's a big jumping the meter for affordable housing for the state of California and I would say that the localities are not just sitting on the sidelines a number of them are looking at what they can do locally also jumpstart this to the state needs to participate in this cause they've taken away much of the resources that localities had so\nWe really have to do this and we really need to make this investment\nLinda ... is president interviewed and housing an organization dedicated to developing and maintaining affordable housing communities and\nA John ... California state senator who represents the thirty seventh district a year with the G O the senator but there are those who hold the legislature to blame they're not getting enough action on this front and not being able to get things passed\nWell I have the privilege of sitting on the budget conference committee and we get to put together this budget and I'm sitting here listening and I'm going we're we're in the department of finance going to find another hundred and Seventy million dollars per year what needs to be caught\nIn the way of expenditures or what needs to be raised in the way of taxes I had to build this year that I asked the governor for just one million dollars a year and he said there was no room in the budget\nSo we've got to be really seriously looking at how we income for ourselves and this is for thirty five years so we're going to give this to our kids and our grandkids long past the time that these new jobs have been created to do the construction and so we've got to be really careful about the overall picture especially when California is already\nI met several problems have Thirteen or thought to park boulevard a big dirt spill in\nThe right lane traffic backed up two cars in St cemetery bridge was spent all jammed up because of the stalled that might still be after the high rise reporter there about twenty minutes ago two thirty seven ...

by this afternoon\nWelcome to forum on Michael Krasny in his new book presidents of war Michael Beschloss writes about nine commanders in chief who have faced a heavy burden of war\nBut as much as he describes the mental and physical toll war takes on an individual presidents he also writes\nThe wars are increasingly being entered into at the behest of the president not Congress the book examines the complex decisions wartime presidents of struggle with throughout history from the war of Eighteen twelve to the President's Day and whether they're going to war is still subject to the will of the American people Michael Beschloss says author nine books on presidential history and has been called\nThe nation's leading presidential historian buy Newsweek and he joins us for this for um our look at Michael Beschloss\nPrime from Michael how are you I'm good and delighted to have you here I was saying Oh thank you I Am to say that one of my producers are boy it's been so long at least a decade since we've had ... and then I realize you've been writing his book for the last and you're\nRight it took ten years I'm Sorry [laughter] nothing to be with a holiday I Would have loved to get it at ... really needed to take that long as it turns out\nWhile you're covering almost two centuries and nine president rice is a lot of territory and wrote as a really much to recommend that it's a lot of narrative a force it really is compelling and uh before I go on a praising let's go to the actual thesis of the book which I think they just addressed\nThat is increasing sense of a more and more power for presidents when it comes to war I I guess the key point really was truly\nYeah that's exactly right you know as you know when the constitution the founders wanted to make sure that presidents did not become dictators and they felt that the way that people in Europe kings and and the monarchs of Europe took power illicit plea most of all was when they got to be unpopular\nThey would come up with some reason to go to war\nThe country would go to war of the nation would be United and once again the ... the king was popular again and so the founders ... as you know we're trying really hard to make sure that\nPresidents never got too much power so you look at the constitution the president wants a war what the constitution says is that Congress has to be the ones to declare it\nBut as history moved on more and more presidents took that power for themselves and you're absolutely right Michel the moment that was really key was Harry Truman\nIn June of Nineteen fifty the north Koreans invaded the south for him and said okay we Americans have to respond with force\nAnd his advisors said you know if you're if you've got a major war in mind Mr President you've got to go to Congress and ask for war declaration the same wave of James Madison did and all these presidents all the way up to FDR in Nineteen forty one and Nineteen forty to\nHe can send you messages exalted himself and get giving you orders conceivably using exactly that same mechanism you know our liberties are always in danger but they are most in danger when you've got a president in a war\nAnd you also have a president who in fact we played a kind of years where you were talking about how uh he had said at one point Obama's going to lead us into war in Iran or President Obama's going to do that because it will ensure has being re elected and he really kind of laid out the fact that he saw\nThe presidential power as a way of indeed not only conducting a war leading a war leading us into war but also a helping boost the election is likely they are in fact it was true about Madison or as you said earlier going all the way back so there's this is a country which\nWhich is really scary that those two ideas are in Donald Trump's had that war helps you politically and he has also said I notice he said that the great presidents in history or those who have waged war not the greatest idea to be in his head at this moment\nOf course historians of often validated that heaven saying I mean there's been this sensed it Roosevelt in Lincoln were great presidents because they let us through these terrible that ravages of war\nThat is true but what I'm worried about is a president who is has the capability of\nDoing worth like things may even be doing those right now [noise] feeling that to rewards for that could be number one you help yourself politically winning an election elevating your full ratings and also you might be well rewarded by history is not wrong but I'd rather not have that in his brain right now\nWe also are facing many of us as citizens of this country they're concerned about uh someone like President Trump with his hands on the nuclear weapons but there's a time that you write about were technical use of nuclear weapons has actually advanced\nYeah that was one of the scopes in the book in the early Nineteen sixty eight LBJ\nWas waging the war in Vietnam which he did mostly badly made terribly terrible mistakes but he did do one good deed it turns out from these documents I got that were just declassified and that is in January of Nineteen sixty eight his commander William Westmoreland in Vietnam said\nWhy don't we avert a defeat in Vietnam by considering the use of tactical nuclear weapons or maybe chemical warfare\nUm and move nuclear weapons to Vietnam right now when there's got to Johnson and Johnson said we're not going to do that you know that's the last thing on earth I Want\nIn this this war that's going so badly now going nuclear and Johnson was so adamant about it and he said lock up all the documents that show what Westmoreland has asked put them in a safe I don't want some general learning about this and saying I'm avoiding a way of ending the Vietnam War\nIn victory and they were locked up ban or kept from public view for decades which is one\nUh kept from public view for decades which is one reason why I was able to see them later on\nAs I'm that by the way Michael was you know sometimes people say it doesn't matter who is president I Hope that no one who was lived through the last two years of our history with say that it doesn't matter who is president but\nIn case there is one person listening who's still thinks that that might be true you need someone with that kind of wisdom and understanding that if a general is beginning to talk about nuclear weapons in a war that's totally peripheral our to our security as the mom was\nCivil war in an agricultural country you need a president with Johnson's firmness who will shut that down what\nAre your thoughts so Michael about the sense of ... particularly in recent vintage ah presidents have had very little experience obviously Eisenhower being an exception with anything in the realm of the military or even service to this country in the military particularly recent Presidents Clinton and Obama and now Trump [noise]\nThat is something that is a development that's more it's it's more it's even more true generally in our society for instance if you walk down the streets of Washington DC fifty or sixty years ago\nYou would see a lot of people in uniform now that's no longer true that would have also been true in San Francisco even in peacetime that's what's happening to our society\nAnd now with Donald Trump we've got the first president and all of our history two hundred years who has had no governmental experience no military experience any if God Forbid we have a national emergency that threatens war we're going to be in a big National Lab experiment because we cannot predict what's going to happen\nAnd by the way we should mention was general Westmoreland recommended the use of a nukes uh when Johnson was president we're talking with Michael Beschloss presidential historian and author of the new book\nPresidents of war he appears Thursday at noon at the commonwealth club here in San Francisco and seven PM at Dominican University in ... with the passage and ah\nAlthough the argument that well the president's aren't declaring war and in fact one thinks about in conjunction with smaller wars are Obama's intervention in Libya or some slamming Syria for that matter but the purse strings are still Congress as\nIt's not enough I mean I\nThe whole idea of the constitution was that if you have to go to war Congress for a war declaration there's a debate a president has to say this is how long I think this is going to last this is how many lives are going to be lost this is\nThe strategy I'm going to use and also Congress has signed onto it the problem that that just a resolution then that's what president said we easily done since Nineteen forty two forty two was the last war declaration\nUh resolutions were used by LBJ and sixty four George H W. Bush for the Gulf War\nA George W. Bush for Iraq and Afghanistan the problem there and we've seen it is that senators for instance who vote for a resolution can say well that was just a resolution to use force if necessary I had not never had in mind that would be a real war\nThe whole point of this is that the best war presidents in history had been those who have ruthless criticism from members of Congress and also this kind of the debate we've lost that\nWell we go back to the medicine for a moment because ah his predecessor Thomas Jefferson managed to avoid that war with England and you could make the argument I think you do that every wars the presidential war and has been since ...\nAnd that's what it has become and the problem here is the president's often times you know do this for a fake reasons you know you were talking about poke\nAnd the fake incentives in Texas Eighteen Ninety eight William McKinley a ship it sunk in Havana Harbor the ... the main and McKinley says we've got to have a big war against Spain largely in revenge for the sinking of our ship\nTurns out the ship was sunk by stand it was done by a boiler accident yet\nMcKinley exploited that for a war that made the United states a world power\nYou can argue round or flat where there was a good idea for a U.S to take the Philippines and Guam and Puerto Rico and change the regime and Cuba's and become a a world power for the first time but that's what history as it ends versus means you know\nI like the fact that San Francisco is part of the United states and not part of Mexico so the reason that happened was pokes war problem is pokes war was based on allied with a very bad model for later presidents\nProblem here is that you know let's say the Gulf of Tonkin of Nineteen sixty four resolution\nLeading to that big war in Vietnam let's say the the war in Vietnam ended in victory in Nineteen sixty six we would probably be looking at Lyndon Johnson and certainly what certain ways as a model war president which should not be the case\nWe're talking with Michael Beschloss one of the nation's leading and most preeminent historians or American history in presidential history and if you'd like to\nJoin us let me tell you

author of the new book on the president's award [noise] this is forum on Michael Krasny [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nFalling down the gauntlet and saying if you take a DNA test in prove you have any\nUh indigenous Native American blood rival put a million dollars in your favorite charity and now he denies the ever even made that statement I mean there are things on tape or like you know grab 'em by the whatever that he now says was a doctor tape and so forth so you have a president who is not you know ... all the time what do you\nLive here lies hour after hour after hour and we know that he wants as much power as he can possibly get\nWe know that he will do almost anything for politics so given what upset about war Michael the arrows begins to point to a huge temptation by this president's to do things that may lead us into a major war that is not necessary I Am extremely worried\nAre you also worried about a Kevin are becoming a justice because he's a great believer and executive power\nThat's exactly it a cabin are wrote an article as you know two thousand nine Minnesota law review was saying the press\nOur wrote an article as you know two thousand nine Minnesota law review was saying that presidents\nPerhaps should not be subpoenaed should not be investigated should not be indicted and they can use ... pardons in lavish ways [noise]\nWhatever else you think about Brett Kavanaugh he's got the most extreme fringe views of being permissive about powerful presidents of almost anyone who was on Trump's list so why do you think you chose\nWe now have the justice on the Supreme Court the deciding fifth vote Yvette conservative majority\nWho not only has those views you know not a president do almost anything he wants but also during the last couple of weeks before his confirmation he became\nYou know very indebted and very much you know bonded to Donald Trump and his people\nThey were divided in strategy is to get him through the confirmation a Donald Trump is not very shy about making people indebted to him when Neil Gorsuch his previous nominee was going before the Senate and said something's taint the critical of Trump Trump set in public you know I can ricin these nominations too\nAnd the other thing that really is very worrisome to me is that we know that Cabot all was that the White House you know plotting in this confirmation strategy with one of the things that they do is they say tell us your most potentially damaging damaging personal secrets\nSo that we can be prepared for them in case they come out and you have to deal with that I Am not exactly saying what about the prospect of Donald Trump\nPossibly knowing Brett Kavanaugh knowledge most damaging personal secrets and the prospect that in the pretty near future Brett Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote on a case that determines whether\nYou know Donald Trump continues and the presidency or can use presidential power potentially in a way that's almost dictatorial that makes me very nervous\nAnd if they some more callers on Frank go ahead you're on the air\nYeah so I'm Wondering about the war Powers Act and why that can't be used terrain that if president I'm Billy Clearwater on a personal basis\n[noise] it it it was a noble attempt at the end of Vietnam but didn't really work this is Seventy three Seventy four of the war Powers Act that basically says that a president can send in troops but has to justify within a period of time\nOr a number of weeks and if he doesn't do it he has to withdraw the troops a lot of damage can be done in that period of time and [noise]\nI don't think it really ultimate the rains and the president and also it's sort of the concessions that the Congress has perfectly fine with the ... constitution being violated because the constitution doesn't say anything about that it says you want a major war you've got to come to Congress\nLet me think Frank for his call and move on to another caller and let's go to Hannah next ana thanks for winning you're on [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] I mean you\nKnow why why ding ding dong\nLine [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd it's a very important question and I thank you for it I mean you recall I Know Michael during the war in Iraq in the lead up to the war in Iraq there were citizens protesting saying weapons of mass destruction don't exist this is a lie and so forth but it didn't keep us from the floodgates of war\nAnd they turned out to be true and maybe if there had been a real debate in Congress it might've explored how shaky the evidence of weapons of mass mass destruction [noise] really was and you know remember I was talking earlier about some of the worst things the president can do\nIf the president knows that the reason for war is not true and I think the evidence still allowed on George W. Bush one way or the other\nBut if you have a poke for instance or if you haven't LBJ who knows that the reason for war is ally and yet goes ahead then you've got family members of dead American Soldiers you know for instance because I've I've written so much and LBJ I Can't tell you Michael how many people I have\nRun into it's heartbreaking to say you know you studied Johnson you study the Vietnam War please tell me that my family member who died in Vietnam did not die in vain and what do I say\nSixty thousand people probably died without actually right but how can I possibly say that to someone it's the truth\nWell I think it comes down at least in terms of kind of a polemic or use that word of advice would lead but essentially an argument that the only reasons we should go to war on an absolute necessity in out of the support of Congress and the public\nYeah that's well that's my view and it has to be sort of a last resort and I'm really worried if you have a president who sees this as the road to political power popularity is the road to\nYou know pop potentially almost off for a teary and power you know presidents who are waging war you know\nDeclaring martial law for instance that's part of a lot of war plans and using that presidential alert announcement that we talked about a few moments ago that could be an enormous temptation and again I'm not predicting yet with Donald Trump but I'm saying it's inevitable that he's going to be tempted you know let's say six months from now\nHe's in trouble with Robert Mueller and his numbers are falling and he's looking to possibly running for reelection in two thousand twenty and he remembers that [noise]\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro at Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nJohn you're on the morning or\nGood morning Michael thank you both for all your good work I Want to provide some major push back uh from my hero Harry Truman who by the way integrate might\nMinor oh too by the way that's why I'm so disappointed in the small\n... I Want to touch on that please okay I'm a hairy uh integrated the armed forces or when it was not a popular thing to do [noise] oh I I could I could\nList you ten great things that Truman did but it doesn't mean that they didn't do this\nDial gay but we're going to get out of the Korean War if\nHarry Truman went\nTo the United nations to get approval yes out of the undeniable [noise] nah a aggression by North Korea I get a real fall totally not Michael give me a second okay Lyndon Johnson\nHad gotten that George Bush had done that we would not have had a war in Vietnam or war in Iraq so which do not go in the same category as those narrative wealth\nWell a George W. Bush did go to the United nations sending Colin Powell with evidence that turned out later to the fall so un doesn't necessarily get got from an off or at least away from my criticism\nAnd the other thing is that you know it it in ... case and I agree with you he was my hero too but he did something that was sort of cheap and political and he shouldn't have done it from my point of view let me thank\nYou for the call John and go to some comments that are coming in or John defending Truman Joseph attacking Lincoln here's the Joseph says I consider Lincoln a war criminals who led a conflict to kill the largest percentage of Americans of any war and what caused what a civil war and not have been worth it\n[noise] ah there are some people who have this point of view which I Do not share he felt that\nLincoln felt that part at fulfilling his oath was making sure that states did not secede from the union which he felt was illegal under the constitution that he had sworn an oath to defend the constitution but one thing\nThat I admire\nSo much in Lincoln and I think it's important about a war president and that is for about the first year Lincoln tried to say this isn't a war about slavery I'm just you know trying to fulfill the constitution by bringing north and south back together almost like the lawyer he was\nAnd to his great credit within a year or two you realize that that was not working and also", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "16"}
