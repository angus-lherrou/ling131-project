Bek goes on political strategist Buffy ...\nHer both vying to represent the East Bay district which stretches from North Oakland in Alameda County to Hercules in Contra Costa county\nThe race between ... and ... become one of California's most competitive and expensive legislative races and it's a race that political junkies across the country are watching closely since it echoes divisions within the Democratic party with Bernie Sanders our revolution organization endorsing ... and ... bomber endorsing wicks\nToday and for them in this hour we're joined by the two candidates for simply district Fifteen and we'll hear their views on some of the state's most pressing issues from rent control to education but first we're going to hear from ... California politics and government reporter guy must rowdy and why this racist garnering so much attention where the funding is coming from in\nIn a very expensive race be welcome guy back to the program the heavier good morning Michael and we should say the guy moderator to debate between these two candidates without which will be doing in this hour um\nLet's just talk about generally the sense of how this is being I'm essentially frame between what I guess you could call more democratic socialist candidate a Bernie Sanders centers camp and Hillary Clinton kind of traditional democratic candidate I pretty much fits the bill\nSure and I think this is something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago before reforms that allowed for a top two primary we're seeing now to Democrats in the general election I'm In a very blue districts so in you know in the past this would have been a debate really condensed for a primary\nNow this debate as you say divisions between different Democrats on policies like housing and education are allowed to spread all the way through the general election\nAnd yet you look at the physicians and we'll hear from the candidates are on on so many things they agree more than they disagree I mean they're both of we had a debate on proposition ... which is simply to do away with Costa Hawkins and uh we find they're very different in terms of their approach to that and to health care and education but you know and so many things they seem to be\nPutting homelessness at the top of their agenda and housing and they're both in favor of single payer I mean there are a lot of things I Would say more that they agreed upon\nAbsolutely and I think ... like you said to the priorities of the two candidates are very similar and reflect the issues that people care about in this region in in the district which includes Oakland Berkeley Richmond housing is at the top of that transportation\nUm healthcare as you said both candidates support a single payer healthcare um and yeah so I think what's really tend to find the campaign is those issues ... you know within the differences between those issues I'm On something like housing in rent control which has divided the candidates\nUh we have one we have two developments that opened up one three years ago totally affordable housing won the meat of Florida is a project we all know that these things take some time and we are on our way to meeting those goals are the meat a forest project just opened up one hundred units of affordable housing accepted all section eight\nA we have are under construction now project on ...\nStreet which is going to build hundreds of affordable housing and that's already in the work\nWe have also just as a city council we've approve another project on twelfth and McDonnell which will build again to my bringing up a turn for bringing it up we're working on it and do those things take years we know that since the\nSince it you know redevelopment funds were a halted years ago that that that help that made us have to figure out ways to build the Affordable housing that we needed um and we are working with non profit development ah ah organizations to help build these\nAre for the housing that's now in the end the pipe quick\nQuestion would you like to see redevelopment reestablish\nI Would I I don't you know I Would love to see that we we were able to build a ... when we had those resources unfortunately\nUh we we no longer have those resources but that's that's okay because my platform I talk about a building hundreds of thousands of new affordable housing within the next ten years as er an uh an exit assembly member and we can do that we have the resources to do it we are\nThe fifth largest economy in the world we have the resources to be able to do that and I I Am we are as a council I as a council member or we do will collaborate with nonprofit housing developers and none of them\nHave said that passing ... ten will will hinder gross so I'm not sure what my opponent is ... let me\nJust ask your direct question would you be in favor of redevelopment being real sort of like\nWhat and I also just want to point out you know we are in the housing crisis right we have a severe shortage of homes for about two million homes shy of where we need to be\nAnd if you look at my opponent track record she's voted down\nAnd many housing projects she abstained on day one hundred percent affordable hundred and fifty five unit on housing development that we desperately need and so to me this is a major issue and when you're an elected official and you have a shorter amount of time and\nAnd I'm I'm energy and political capital you're so focused should be on solving this crisis and my opponent has spent time pushing things like passing a resolution making Richmond\nA safe haven from government mind control you know that's not what our elected officials should be doing we should be focused on building a home so we need solving our homelessness crisis and that is where it you know if I was in her role I Would be spending my time doing exactly\nJust where we got to start talking a lot of issues here and you're a ... she's laughing and I are laughing because\nYou know that's really pretty preposterous out of the fact that I found a hundred percent affordable housing love to eat and I have talked about this on several radio shows that that is not that that is a is it's a it's really twisting the fact the fact is and we said this before\nThat I Am a stain on a developer that have\nThat I at staying on a developer\nThat have taken advantage that with unscrupulous in several cities in Oakland and San Francisco and so of course I'm not going to vote for a developer a vet with with you know that that doesn't have any scruples\nAlso when we as a city council abstain from using that developer weave in either then voted a four developer that that was trustworthy and had the integrity or to work in in in my city in my city or a ... which is a majority city of color\nAnd so a lot to say that I you know you for bringing the continuing to bring that out it it really didn't want to know a no no no ma'am it did not and I we I abstained on that project\nAnd we then voted we've been voted for another developer or that would do the job a of of uh with some integrity\nYou seem to be somewhat are often as you wrote or at least a strong about developers I mean you do see a lot of them is not necessarily being scrupulous and well\nThis particular developer was yeah there are several uh articles about it and and that's why we as a city council a turn down that particular developer but then we then voted on one that we we knew would be doing the job the right way I'm with that\nWell let me go to another issue that I think you to have a considerable difference who's where there aren't that many really I mean it sounds like a good campaign and it is but you're pretty much the same page on a lot of measures are supposed to measure already [noise]\nUm but you you were both in favor of single payer but again there's a sense of moving incrementally or moving exactly and the fast lane and listen to talk about why you feel you can do it in the fast lane you first you know I feel\nWe can do it in the fast lane we have no time\nPeople are literally dying from I'm not having the healthcare services that they deserve and that they are entitled to as human beings and as Americans in California and I'm so we don't have time to to move it incrementally we don't have time to make a excuses\nFor the conservatives and the federal government I realize that we do need a waiver from the federal government uh but that should not be an excuse for inaction here uh I Believe that we have to take bold progressive\nRadical action right away and not kick the can down the road and that's something that I I tend to do that will be the first issue that I address is bringing forward a single payer Medicare for all system because are for profit health care system is not working and we have\nUh the the resources in California to be able to provide every single Californian on with health care or with health care services and really the money that we save\nFrom the bureaucracy or the money that we would say from that would be able would in in enable us to provide healthcare for every single California right now we're\n... or above your which was on because you don't figure can move that fast obviously why well\nSo I've worked on the ... when I worked for president by my work on health care um I wholeheartedly support a single payer system I wholeheartedly support and Medicare for all system frankly my hope is that there will be done and uh it should be done and the federal government but obviously with the current administration is not going to be I think California can and should lead the way on that\nUm I think we have to have a plan to do that and so here's what I Would do first and foremost we need to protect what we currently have rights so as as the Trump Administration is trying to dismantle the CIA we should pass an individual mandate here we should make sure that we fix our reimbursement rates which is a big challenge here in California we should make sure we have our we ensure our\nUm our immigrant communities and many of them are are\nAre undocumented in their living on the brink and they need those resources but the truth of the matter is the single parent we will need a ... a waiver from the federal government to the tune of two hundred billion dollars to make it work\nDonald Trump is not going to give us that waiver so what do we do between now and at twenty twenty when we have president calmly Harris or president lives with Lauren or someone better that we can work with\nLet's set our system up so that we can have a real conversation when we have um a democratic administration we can work with I advocate for putting a public option on the exchange in the meantime that will help stabilize our exchange make sure\nI'm it's healthy so to speak [laughter] um uh and and get us to the point that once we do have the federal\nUm administration that we can work with we can ... an act of single payer system so for me it's not a matter of do I support it or not I do but we have to have a realistic plan about how we get there and we need to be able to work with a you know our next governor Gavin Newsom as a very um I'm a similar approach to this is I Do\nI Believe that we can do it I Believe that we should do it and I believe that we will do it and we just have to set a certain amount of things in place first\nTalking later Canada's researcher certainly district Fifteen Giovanna Quebec holes and Buffy works and we're going to cover as many issues as we can possibly coming up on a break quick response from your book of records\n... yes I I I think that you know my opponent again you know you mentioned how you know there are things that we are uh we share in common but this is the one thing that really is a a major difference although although my opponent talks about\nA a a believing that you know we can have a single payer system you know we always have to follow the money and and and in this race and in many races we have to follow the money and my opponents donors are the ones that are telling her she has a slow it down a and the reason for it and we're talking about\nPACs PACs led by Ashley Titus who's you know the treasurer of one of the pack the of the California Medical Association and the California dental association these are the folks who are opposing her these are the ones who are doing everything they can possibly do to stop us from getting a Medicare for all of a\nSudden we come up at a regular Buffy ... her\nSo I'm I'm happy to chat about the resources that have gone to both sides of the campaign um and and we can have a more robust conversation around that we do need I think campaign finance reform these independent spenders you get to the both of them are not in finance for 'em but the vast majority my donations have come from individual folks um across a distance\nUm but the vast majority might donations have come from individual folks um across this district in across the state of\nSome of these folks are not going to help you streamline toward single\nFor I think I should be judged on my twenty year track record of working in progressive politics working alongside President Obama to help pass the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd leave it there because we're at the British are heading right our listeners when we return this was for a Michael Crichton\nWe're listening to the rebroadcast of this morning forums program it will continue after a look at traffic here said after the\nEarning good evening to you have an accident to be ethical north bound eight eighty at a street it's in the process of being cleared off the shoulder but we're seeing delays San Francisco south down one oh one at ... collection and do other details books like sensors picking up some delays there\nAnd and it's really the reason why I can do that and take that stance on is because I'm not swayed by a by a billionaire\nDonors who don't want a moratorium on charters want to\nPrivatize our education our education are public education system right now or is being defunded and that that money is is being transferred\nTo you know to the ... to the charter schools and I would challenge you know my support or too old to also um\nYou know very much for border I'm a pardon me my opponent rather I Would I Would challenge her um you know to denounce these\nThese are billionaires who are donating to her to these I eat through I ease rather um and and you know call for a moratorium on charter schools um but I Know that it's very difficult and that's why I don't if if\nThey don't invest in a candidate like me they don't invest in the Kennedy like me because I Would immediately denounce or that any kind of support and so when you have I use that are funded by billionaires who are donating hundreds of thousands of dollars you know they they they know what they're buying and and so\nThey are pretty she's getting about eight hundred Nineteen thousand from ...\nSo you're pretty she's getting about eight hundred Nineteen thousand for my ... and you're getting a hundred and three thousand\nYeah the East that are that are set up by from what I understand um are unions and and unions are working Peter you're going to support so hot that the I eat we're talking about the I eat right or wrong or right now we're talking about the ... but you mentioned in the eyes that are supporting this this raised this movement and I'm a part of\nOur coming from working people\nNot the billionaires who want to privatize our education right not the same billionaires who wanna destroy unions\nAre not the not the billionaires who want to uh build more a private prisons and ah so I Am a I'm an avid supporter\nOf our public school system I believe we have to fully fund them uh I I Am endorsed by the teachers' unions educators and faculty association because they know that I Will stand up\nTo to to these entities who wanna destroy our public school system\nSo forgive me I Want to get to some of our callers and listeners because we're much want to be a part of the ... and a few weeks or here in Studio with us they are contending for district Fifteen they are the candidates and\nRepresent very different points of view in many respects but those should initially was ... or political reporter they're\nOn board on many things as well or some of it is ah the booze backing them a lot of it as you hear is also what kind of speed ought to be moved here ... album making sure people were working forty hours a week make enough to afford living in the bay area companies are not willing to pay employees Vogel do you first\nRight that's that's one of the problems is is a ... a ...\nIs is not in people's pay a is not keeping up with the with increases increases are in in uh in everything food rent\nA that's just not happening and and and and you see on my platform I talk about the fact that we in California the fifth largest economy in the world are we can't afford to pay our workers what they deserve\nA we can't afford to have a living wage I Will advocate for increasing our minimum wage but eventually we have to uh to to talk about and moved towards are paying people a living wage but\nI think this is a huge issue you know we have the highest poverty rate and California and any other state when you take into account cost of living it's about forty percent\nWe see income inequality we've had in Alameda County a forty percent increase in homelessness in the last two years so we're we're seeing the ramifications of of this exact question\nYou know and it's someone who I worked against Wal Mart for a couple of years for the in the labor movement for the United states and commercial workers union they weren't it tore us for being one of the wealthiest companies in the world and yet not providing good health care and wages for their workers I think we need creative innovative solutions to try to close the wealth gap\nOne of the ideas that I think makes sense and I would introduce legislation I'm In Sacramento is to figure\nOut a way to incentivize companies to reduce the pay gap between the highest employee and the lowest paid employee tried to narrow that gap as much as we can\nI also think we have to look at making sure that our folks have I'm I'm a good a job skills training I support for technical vocational programs I'm a product of community college so I Believe there's a lot that can be done to community college level to give folks the skills that they need\nI think we also do casual orientation yet more exactly you know I think that's an important element of this also you look at you know the way in which that we shop now how people live you look at Amazon these distribution centers you look at the working conditions at Amazon distribution centers\nTo stuff has to be fixed you know we've got to figure out a way to to reduce the um the wealth gap that exists here but this is all connected to education housing job training all these issues are connected and I think fundamentally [noise] you know this is also why twenty eight labor unions have endorsed my campaign um and a lot of our progressive champions like ... and others\nUm 'cause I think they think I can go to Sacramento in working with the diverse polish folks to actually get stuff done and move the needle on these issues\nVery gotta get done the fact that we have a lot of callers who want to talk with both of you and let's hear first from Karen deters many years we can Karen good morning\nMorning Hi you're on the air\nAnd yeah I Would like to hear about it huh yeah you're on the air Ken go ahead I'm Sorry to hear what the candidate where they stand on climate change 'em all these editors are going to do that for everybody else get a handle on that I'll take my answer off the\nAir or not effective for the question was started was because he would\nSure so this is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity and I don't mean to be hyperbolic about it but I think that is where we are in times of the essence on this you know I support SP one hundred or support\n'em you know uh doing everything we can to move towards renewable energy reduce fossil fuels this is critical\nYou know assembly member filtering had a bill in the legislature I Believe it died in committee but it's something I think that should come back and doing the sales gasoline cars by twenty forty\nUm those are the things that we need to be doing thirty nine percent of our greenhouse gas comes out of our exhaust by one of our fracking because there's many times before fracking I support a ban on fracking um I think we ... I I I I uh I support a ban on an ... I I Would I Want to do is absolutely critical to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels\nDo you want to move toward that same kind of carbon free um goes we have personally or faster\nFaster I mean I think we've got to go you know this is a very critical issue but with it you know there's a lot that goes with that right so for instance that the the assemble number ... bill if we're going to go all electric vehicles right we have to make sure we have the infrastructure for it you don't have enough\nI'm a places to plug in right now so that all costs resources in time and energy and secondly making sure that are low income communities can participate in that I'm right now electric vehicles are so very expensive so there's a lot I think we've just seen through with this but I Do see it as an urgent issue you know and I for me I think about my my daughter's twenty three months\nYou know what's the future she's going to live and um and her children right I think we're in\nYou know what's the future she's going to live and um and her children right I think we're in a really critical moment on this\nIssue ... obviously it's a great concern to you where do you see yourselves different from what you just heard from his works um well\nThe difference is the fact that I'm indoors ah first of all by the Sierra Club\nA and I'm indoors by every single or environmental organization in California and the reason for that is that they've seen my track record and my voting record us standing up uh to to major polluters I'm like the fossil fuel industry had they've seen me stand up to Chevron\nEnrichment and so so people can trust me to do the very same thing in Sacramento to stand up on behalf of our community and stand up and be half of our planet\nAnd you're not ready to me you know what I'm saying they can't trust your phone\nI'm saying that you can trust someone who's endorsed by every single environmental organization and yes it's it's ...\nThe the way that you get you when you look when you follow the money you you that's how you can determine how a person is going to vote and uh and I'm not I have not\nI'd been endorsed by so many uh one ... all of the environmental organizations in California\nUm because they know that I Will stand up to corporate polluters like I've stood up to Chevron I Will support and they can trust me to support a hundred percent renewables and not to make incremental changes because we don't have time or for that the planet is burning and the ... and and the reason when I say when you talk about trust\nIs that I Am running as a candidate who will always in every single policy decision put the planet put people are put our children before a the profits of of big a billionaire Corp\nBy going to get another caller on because there's a lot of callers are fun to go to Mary from Oakland first and we'll come back if we can marry go ahead [noise]\nGetting money thank you for taking my call I'd like to ask the candidates what their role regarding the California budget would be\nOkay it's a very direct question and can be answered a maybe in one sentence or but I Know you wanted to respond to what you just heard from Giovanna ... weeks or so maybe you could integrate that in a from ... excuse me she called us support and now I'm calling you where are you in\nRight right I have both of you and your mission that my opponent said about following the money with regard to environmental issues I think what she was trying to say that somehow I'm you know by painted by the oil and gas industry\nThat is categorically false trying to be very clear about that I've never taken any oil and gas when they have never taken any money that has ... and it would have any negative impact on the environment and so I just want to make sure we just clear of the rest of their on that um with regard to the budget you know the the the challenge with the budget in California it's very volatile it's very much tied to personal income right\nThey're looking a lot better too self slow from three eighty and down to about true still that's the worst of it is not backed up all the way through Daly city some heavy traffic there but actually not that much worse than usual\nNorth bound to be at the ... looks like ocean Geneva looks like a new crashed there but the usual slow traffic behind it or the serious crash wonder wonder where the typical slow down now from the candlestick area or will call sister cities boulevard up to about ... or ...\nJoe's report brought to you by Pacific catch west coast bishops support for cake weedy comes from the California earthquake authority a damaging earthquake could happen at any time in California learn the steps to take for personal family in financial protection at earthquake authority dot com [noise]\nYou're listening to remember supported ...

by the listeners of cake you read the\nFair weather conditions are forecast over the bay area today a high pressure is expected to start building inland over the state resulting in a warming trend that there will push temperatures to above seasonal average is that'll happen starting tomorrow in continuing to Saturday and then a cooling trend will return Sunday under early next week\nFor today well partly cloudy skies and high temperatures ranging from the low sixties or the coast to the upper seventies inland\nWoke up to a forum on Michael Krasny\nAs you've been hearing on NPR suspicious packages that have been sent to Hillary Clinton Brock Obama and the time Warner center which has been evacuated and will continue to monitor that story and bring you updates but first national security adviser John Bolton announce to the United states will withdraw from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty the INS\nAfter meeting with Russian President Vladimir putting on Tuesday the treaty was signed by president Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev and Nineteen eighty six and helped lead to the end of the Cold War\nThe White House says Russia has been violating the treaty and that is useless without China's participation\nBut critics warn that withdrawing from the treaty will accelerate a new dangerous nuclear arms race and joined us to discuss is Michael McFaul is director of the Freeman slowly Institute for International Studies at Stanford former U.S ambassador to Russia in his new book is from Cold War to hot peace welcome Michael McFaul\nThanks for having me good to have you also good to have Matthew Craig who joins us as well deputy director for a strategy a disco cross Center for strategy and security at the Atlantic council he's also professor of governance and foreign service at Georgetown University and we welcome you professor granted\nHappy to be here glad to have you in a microphone begin with you and let's just say that uh this Nineteen eighty six treaty held up for a while pretty well in as many people view that\nWas one of the most successful treaties in terms of dealing with arms control a barn to us and Russia from possessing land based shorter medium a range nuclear missiles but\nGoing back even to the Obama administration was you were part of the there seem to have been violations from the Russians and that's being held centers piece here in terms of breaking away by John Bolton company\nA yet there were a violation or they were serious uh we are focused on them and I assume the president or the Trump Administration has done the same\nAnd when their violations they have to be dealt with a what I don't understand is when one side violates the treaty why the other side withdraw so that makes no sense to me whatsoever [noise]\nA a I think better course of action would have been to make more public\nWhat those violations are most of that information is classified and to put pressure on Russia with our allies in Europe\nTo get back in compliance with the treaty by doing it this way all the negative focus now is on us if you look at European Capitals today and and leaders they're all blaming us for leaving the treaty ah which I think just politically makes no sense I also think it makes no strategic sense for us to pull out of it but maybe we can come back to that later well the British\nA on defense issues better for uh the European defense and tougher on Russia than any US President since Reagan so you have this\nDecision on high enough or you have a strengthening\nIn saying that radically why aren't they agreeing with you\nUm let me just finish I'm OK and actually many of the I'm a professional die I talked to in a European governments do agree with that they say about the underlying policy uh it's quite good um but\nI'm Trump is unpopular with public unpopular with their politicians on so that does make a cooperation difficult\nBut what am I signed it Matthew MS or one or a question on this what about what the ambassador said that uh uh Russia has been for the most part whether John Bolton the company had been for the most part against any kind of agreement\n[noise] well the uh the only legacy arms control uh I I think it's Russia that's really been opposed to these like uh the arms control agreement so they're cheating on high enough but they've been cheating on others as well open sky they pulled out of conventional forces of Europe treaty or so the only one that remains is the new start agreement\nBetween the United states and Russia signed by the Obama administration and twenty ten\nWhich they've been talking about extending another five years or and vote and has actually said that so Michael McFaul deceptively speak about boat and being perhaps more amenable to some kind of agreements\nNo actually I'm very worried about that\nI'm a I I was part of the team that help to negotiate the new start treaty or it was I think it's a really sound treaty I think it's got great verification mecca mechanisms\nI used to joke in the government if you remember Ronald Reagan said a trust but verify I used to say don't trust only verify and I'm worried that this is the next target for Mr both him he's not a supporter of the new start treaty he did not support in two thousand ten and I think this is going to be the next building block\nOf the arms control regime that was set up in the eighties and nineties or that they're going to go after and I think that's just not an American national interest\nUh I don't you know we need to have somebody explain why is it going to make us safer\nTo increase the number of weapons deployed in Europe it's just that simple I Want to hear that argument I also am a defense or you know a specialist here what is the logic how does that make us safer to decrease the amount of\nTime we have for a conventional and may be nuclear exchange with the Russians I've got some callers here but meth Ukrainian quick response from you on that\nYes I I think we it was mentioned why this treaty was signed it in the first place in the Nineteen eighties and a big part of the reason it with find is because the Russians understood that there'd be serious cost if it wasn't find the United states had purging missiles in Europe pointed at Russia Russia was concerned about that and to get out from under that threat\nAgreed to this treaty and so if we allow Russia that systematically violate the treaty without cost\nThen there's no reason for them to come back into compliance they get to have their cake and eat it too so one of the benefits of pulling out is to show Russia that there will be cost and if we're serious about saving the treaty about renegotiating out and this would be unnecessary first stop\nAll right let me bring some callers abort her den your first stop good morning\nYes a Rochelle want to use nuclear weapon part of their defense or because they cannot compete without the only way to control Russia desire to embed our power with our NATO allies\nEven aim idiot who brought in Iraq or fame why they leave your lateral American our without any limitation their whole and they're dangerous and they're doing it again\nSponsorship of the cake you eating my dream my sanity from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with Kennedy on demand\nYes my question is I Am a legal one um it takes a Senate confirmation to approve a treaty and make it a law that buying the entire United\nStates how can a president and his own without Senate approval withdraw from a treaty\nThat will go to you on that a method crediting\nWell not a constitutional lawyer and there has been some debate about this in recent days ah with with some people raising the question that people who are seems most informed on that\nUh as far as I can tell have said that while Senate approval is necessary to a a ratified treaty that congressional approval is not an has never been a necessary for a president to withdraw from a treaty to my understanding is that a presidential mashed ration does have the legal right to withdraw from international\nI think that's pretty accurate Michael is always agree\nYeah that's right uh the Bush administration pulled out of the ... treaty didn't require center to provide don't as a you know as an American citizen I don't think that's a good rule I you know I think we should reconsider that but that that's the way the Constitution's ... has been written and interpreted so far\nNone of question to you Michael McFaul from a listener named Davis has what benefit is putting getting from throughout the industry we have an administration riddled with Russian influence so that seems relevant to ask and indeed seeming creating was saying I met him he was saying later earlier prefer forgive me that I'm from the standpoint of uh the Russians are\nWhat are they getting out of this really you see a microphone\nWill first just look at all the European newspapers today they've already ... ... that's the first you have to ... we are we are the ones being criticized for pulling out of this treaty not Russia\nWe all say well we know they're in gross violation but actually most people don't know their and gross violation and the evidence for that had not been declassified so that's number one\nNumber two the premise of the Trump Administration is that we're pulling out so that we're going to increase the cost for Russians are for doing this but that the presumption there is that we're going to build up our\nAh intermediates and a missile forces on the ground as a deterrent to Russia that that's an assumption that's not going to happen automatically I'm not sure it's going to happen at all and so this notion that that we're going to punish them\nUh for their violations of the INS treaty by pulling out in building up I I'm I'm skeptical of that and I worry that three to five years down the road they will have built up their forces and we will have not met that because we don't have agreement within NATO\nAnd we will be the worse off for that that to me just makes no sense whatsoever\nAnother caller joining us Andrew you're on good morning\nHi I have one comment one question or comment is that I I feel like this is not Trump being tough on Russia does the Trump giving Russia a great PR when and and also a this is the senior military who are terrified of Trump's relationship with Russia\nI'm being able to serve there will\nBe an absence of a president who understands or cares about the details and as you rapidly losing political capital to resist that the comment that question is what we're like realistically\nOh let's see we go to nuclear war what can you do tactically intermediate range nuclear missile that you can't already do with all of our she knew and ICBMs\nYeah important good question thank you Matthew ... let me go to Hugh\nYes well I'm a couple of points here so uh what can you do with the intermediate range you can't deal with Aaron C launched the I I don't think there's any\nOne advocating that the United states returned\nReturned ground based missiles to Europe right now I think about it or make falls right that the European allies don't want that uh and the new nuclear posture review which came out earlier this year does call for other new capabilities that would be based on us ships for this reason but where the ground launched could be very helpful is in Asia\nAre and that is really the major defense challenge facing the United states and its allies are from China over the coming decade\nOut China has thousands of these ground launched missiles if we're going to try to have the same kind of firepower delivered from carrier battle groups delivered from uh advance spiders\n... we're not going to be able to keep up it's going to be too expensive so having these missiles that we could deploy a in Japan Guam Australia and the future perhaps in other countries that would be mobile\nAh really create a serious defense challenge for China would contribute to a deterrent there and wait contribute to stability so that's a it's an Asia where this really has a military watcher\nBut we've got ... seconds left to and I'd like to hear about some itself from you on a question from a listener about the economics of all this uh literally just seconds left but he's talking about a book called wars Iraq and nieces fellows profit\nMaking war machines is some nations with employing order either distracted boost their economies wonder if you have some thoughts on the\nI just think all arms races are bad it leads to production a vet is not in the economic interest\nAnd if we pull out of the new start treaty which I think is the next shoe to drop we're going to have to spend billions and billions of dollars in intelligence to achieve what we can through that tree right now so free serve American national interest they don't and we should preserve them not\nWe'll leave it there thank you Michael McFaul Michael McFaul gain directs the freemans fully Institute for International Studies his new book is from Cold War to hot peace and thank you must be granting who is deputy director for strategy was across the center for strategy and security and professor at Georgetown state to we're going to keep you up on the license\nAnd professor at Georgetown say to we're going to keep you up on the market is\nA gotta Nick Miroff or is national security reporter with the Washington Post and say that there's probably another current events\nComing up from Guatemala but I wanted to go to our guests are see up a poor Tio because um she's very conversant with what's going on in Honduras which actually leading many of these people out or to try to get into the United states or to try to get in Mexico or wherever they can and\nLet's talk about that with you professor ... because I'm a lot of people don't really know about the conditions there and a focus first on the politics because there was a coup back in two thousand nine of was supported by the United states during the Obama administration by\nHillary Clinton was secretary of state and uh uh what we had and I was for the most part a very corrupt regime and up in many ways a highly militarized regime that the people who are rebelling against the people do one of the skate because of corruption but what we heard earlier was the main reason they want to do or their way up to find a way of north for work\nWell for nine actually on the regular corrupt breaking apart it by the United states I'm finding primary carried training for a good actor for prosperity for combat poverty\nUm to fight on the program and he is staying home and I will nominate center poverty at all in fact I'm part of the population and complete poverty\nAnd that it um most of the money that on our land are receiving it falls on a diet um by the you know he didn't treat her like pulling them out for me actually\nSponsorship Vicki you we do you live stream funny Cindy from Comcast ... Internet delivers in home wife I for all devices in the home\nProsperity to combat poverty um despite all the programs on the usa ideas investing in\nIn Honduras on there has been ... poverty at an all in fact I'm sixty point nine percent of the population lives in complete poverty and that is because um most of the money that on our land or London is receiving from\nThe United states is being spent on military I saying that society by the you know he instituted in two thousand fourteen the military police and it's actually if you look at human rights reports this is the police that the most corrupt right the one that's actually committing while these crimes it's in ...\nOr ... committing crimes but actually I'm inclusion ways gang members right so most people do not go to\nPut national police or even trust the military police\nTo report crimes to because they know that somehow a gang member we'll find out about this so\nIt's a politically militaristic a repressive regime any kind of protest is seeing its met with a tear gas at excessive amount of tear gas as most of your listeners must have heard or seen in November two thousand Seventeen he came to power twin illegal\nA re election bid which he remembered you going to nine months and I was actually ousted because people thought that he you know they were there a right wing in Latin America thought that he wanted to re elect himself and he wanted to work with Venezuela and ... and they got one but in reality what we're seeing is the exact same thing only in the right\nRight um at one another and then\nGet illegally reelected himself and with a fraudulent election clearly the alliance um that the opposition won on so\nBarren this incredibly polarized country at this point um it's it's politically repressive like I said any kind of\nUm [noise] ... severe repression in fact I wasn't on do that's on a full bred um earlier this year and from January to August and I witnessed in protest police shooting real bullets actually have pictures of real bullets that were shot into a crowd and\nPeople were there just to protest the outcome of the elections basically right they weren't there you know they're exercising their rights under the constitution I'm you know it's I I just wanted to you know for us to understand that you know where although it is actually going back to the Nineteen thirties that the plane with\nIs a right wing turn not only that but it's all of Latin America so all this money that goes into poverty again corruption is a big problem right but correction corruption stems from supporting one of the most ... militaristic\nA right wing parties in Central America which is a nationalist parties\nAnd there's also a very young in many ways the serious are kind of profound change in the economy there are a lot of land concessions to\nA multinationals who's been described like go to blogs and the rich neighborhoods in areas where you can't even walk or you can't even go into and all those extortion\nAnd corruption trying to teach young kids and get them in the games I mean there's just a horror stories about the horror stories but I'm Wondering what your responses to the fact that\nThere was an article by Margaret Sullivan on the language is being used in this whole\nMigrant migration you were talking about here they're talking about it as an onslaught of president then attacked on our country and non union Associated Press called it an army this coming forward and all this talk about middle Easterners or being a part of this I Know there was a Guatemalan I'm what I'm On\nPresident said that he actually arrested people who are nice as soon as it's been blown up at the same time there seems to be a movie people's minds we do validity to this uh there there's a real ... I just like your thoughts about what the media's reporting it's a humanitarian crisis with its resume and also there's a dangerous for the United states\nI don't want you know there these are refugees and under international refugee of all we need to see them at five fifty but in Mexico and one of my life and in the United states people have legitimate claims um you know this is an incredibly polarized society where you have gang members\nUm you know if you live in a particular neighborhood you can cross into another neighborhood you know I grew up in Los Angeles in the nineties and I remember the blood and the current wars and I remember how how difficult to watch for for you to work different colors to schools public schools and south LA you know so\nIt's the same kind of scenario happening there if you live in a particular neighborhood that's controlled by MS Thirteen and you can't go into a neighborhood that's controlled by Eighteenth street\nThat could mean gas for you know working\nClass people what they're saying is is accurate and again I've I've actually done the research in this community to an interview people who've explained it to me as well right but the other thing you know that we need to realize is that since the clue the top\nThe top broke on wood are financially let's be real here um according to the economic um commission for Latin American the Caribbean there has been very little gross\nI'm for agriculture and I'll do it I don't do that is not a country that\nAre tending gauge and global economy uh in in the whole basis with Europe or the United states right this is a developing nation very poor nation that\nYou know most of it's it's fun to most of the GDP comes from coffee but none of melon African Palm Desert workers who are losing their jobs because we're going into contingency labor techniques are temporary labor programs you know that's what\n... calls development right in my district which are informal economy industry so these neighborhoods are poor extremely poor and when you have a weak government that can provide jobs that can't deal with poverty you're going to see the growth of narco trafficking\nAnd you mentioned you were going to know every upon which has become a major source of\nIncome for a while but then there were those oil new oil deserve through with the growth of them I mean we get snow\nThen there are those oil new oil that's interfering with the growth of them I mean we've got so many problems of Mary a number of them and I want to give our listeners an opportunity to weigh in here and you can weigh in of course was comments but also with questions you might have\nAnd uh we're talking about the Central American migrants caravan continuing its journey up north more than at this point seven thousand Central Americans heading towards the United states Mexico border if you have some thoughts or if you have some questions we welcome them you can join us now at our toll free number the number to\nCall his eight six six seven three three six seven eight six join\nUs at that number eight six six seven three three six seven eight six or\nYou can email us for almost ... dot org or go to our website in post questions or comments there at ... dot org slash forum or tweet us our Twitter handle is ...

here in the city\nWill come to a forum on Michael Krasny Yale philosophy professor Jason Stanley has spent the last decade studying fascist propaganda politics and tactics\nHe says that the formula for fascism is surprisingly simple and that's all right wing autocrats follow a similar playbook a vocal last mythic past so divisions and attacked the truth professor Stanley joins us this hour to talk about his new book how fascism works the politics of us and them\nAnd we'll also hear from him about the parallels he sees between President Trump's rhetoric that have passed dictators and\nWhat do you make sure the president's recent declarations that he's a quote pro nationalist welcome Jason Stanley thank you very much good to have you with us this morning let's get to that nationalist characterization first or how much are we to link that or or ugly to link that to fascism\nWell I think that not national fascism requires nationalism not all nationalist movements are fascist but nationalism is the core of a fascist ideology I mean my income\nIs or not to compare I'm not comparing the president to Hitler I bought a darn many different fascist movements only one of which was the national socialists\nBut mine confidence an argument for national state a Hitler wants to\nDeconstruct the uh the the state the sort of bureaucratic state and replace it by a heart by a by a national state by which he means a state based on a particular nationality an ethnicity in his case Iran as them\nSo nationalism is different from patriotism patriotism the NYU a philosopher towns in Shaw recently tweeted today\nPatriotism is allegiance to a political entity that incorporates specific moral and political virtues whereas nationalism is allegiance to a real or imagined cultural or ethnic community\nAnd that's how Hitler means net nation to nation state the nation and the national state in my column he means a a cultural or ethnic community by not say a set of Dr Renz a surrounding say liberty and equality of sorts than try and in the constitution\nI'm Glad you made a division between nationalism and patriotism because George Orwell made it and you made it quite a illuminating lately I should say but nationalism particularly for those who are afraid of a\nTrump being identified with the kind of fascism that you write about in the particularly because of Charlottesville and because of excluding people from\nHaving an inconsistent group but altogether one not\nThat aims that that ends up ah looking fascists so\nI think ... so fascism is an ideology based on power loyalty and fear of the other\nUh it's harshly patriarchal the idea is that ah that at the very center of it is power is loyalty to a nation to a national like ethnic identity and which is represented in the body of a strong leader who represents and speaks for that nation\nBut when I look at the actual of neo conservative estimate is more like globalism [laughter] agree if when I when I look at actually you\nHave ten a ways of looking at what\nConstitutes fascism a kind of a deck a log of sorts a and I'm I'm struck by a lot of the things the churches that are made against our president for example anti intellectual um\nUnreality facts or D based without a common understanding a hierarchy fascist politicians attempt to prove natural divisions between us and them\nVictimhood any games for minorities them or a loss for us\nA law and order criminals lawlessness\nA native policing these are the kinds of things that are they do fit to some extent patterns of many see in the president\nBut also the lying in the ... um that is identified with the president also seemed to be almost characteristic of every fascist regime but make the distinction if you would cause you make it in your book between fascist politics in the fascist state it's an important one\nRight so fascist politics is employing certain tactics to gain power fascism remmer as an ideology based on power loyalty and fear of the other so fascist tactics are\nTactics are tactics that you used to seize power once you seize power well you can do different things and historically\nPeople who employ these tactics did do different things mostly needed not commit genocide in Italy or I mean he killed many people in in Ethiopia and Eritrea but\nHe didn't commit genocide in in Italy he didn't focus on the Jews are people fascist tactics and fascist politics are a set of tactics that I describe in how propaganda works to seize power and hold onto it what you do when you make when you get power\nWell that may not you know that's going to differ from country to country and I think what we face in the United states is very clearly fascist tactics and fascist politics\nAnd that that are that are increasingly popular and increasingly are effective in our country as we lose our democratic culture ah\nA effective in our country as we lose our democratic culture a ... which does not mean that we have a fascist government we clearly did not have a fashion\nBut she makes a point that with a fascist tactics you can lead not only to serious refreshing freedoms are big but you dehumanizing off in a group and\nThat can turn to justifying inhumane treatment that can also turn to a aggression of all different sorts of mess imprisonment or even extermination I mean you mentioned genocide is certainly lived there in Germany but it led there\nAre in Rwanda lived there in Myanmar which is curiously enough of becoming a more democratic state at the same time that it's taking their anger people in a centrally committing genocide against them so\nWe we got to democracy for some democracy for some yeah thank you for the [laughter]\n... except that editorial come in because I think that's absolutely correct or where one does concern but the picture gets crowded and many people's minds because\nAnd I think this is an important point that you make authoritarianism and a autocratic uh tactics which identify with fascism can be very veils and they can come under different or shall we say appearances and so the reality behind them sometimes is not seen\n[noise] that's right and they they are they and you know and leaders ... I mean\nThe president is not ... ... ... and in Brazil who's openly promising a extrajudicial killings and a talks about an open and says clearly ... a so fashion fascist politics as harshly homophobic\nHarshly patriarchal ... says he's rather said he's rather rather I'd rather have a dead son than a gay son\nAh so you have this harsh patriarchal politics because\nIn fascism and fascist ideology the father of the nation stance of the nation as the father of the fat of a patriarchal family stands to the rest of the family he has the protector he is the protector of his women and children\nThink she was saying the twenty sixteen convention or you you highlight of the fact that Donald Trump said I Am your voice\nYes that's a fascist tactics\nTo represent himself as the voice and that I mean Kanye West when he went to the White House people people criticize Kanye West for for not being coherent but I heard I'm being very coherent he said you know I grew up in a home without a father and you\nWant to put on this hot I feel like I have a father I feel like you represent you played his father role and that's how fast is politics works that's of course not sufficient but it's one part a fascist politics at the leader as the father\nIn in the patriarchal sense they they lead by strengths than dominance not by moral authority\nThere's also just the fact that facts known really work in fascism orange stirring up nationalism in a more toxic sense I'm\nThinking about ... for example who said the masses aren't necessarily convinced by the facts and when you have someone who's more fascist role in that can be a member of a minority group in fact many of the fascist states were minority groups that took over the majority of the people took over the messes with their ideas and was propaganda and this is a very important tool for fascism\nWhere you have to break liberal democracy relies on truth\nLiberal democracy is too great values and this is where my patriotism comes in to liberty and equality liberty requires truth because if you don't have truth you're not free no one thinks that the people of North Korea are free\nBecause they've been like two they literally do not know what they're doing they don't know why they're doing what they're doing so they're not free because they're operating on the basis of\nMisinformation and equality requires truth because equality is politically quality democracy allows us to have differences in wealth but you have to be able to speak truth to power\nSo if you're going to smash liberal democracy than you need to smash truth\nOr if it you know fascism again it's an ideology based on power loyalty and fear of the other so unique to smash truth otherwise you need to make people devalued truth I think it's not important\nYou know that fascist politics is taking in ... when people don't care about the truth when they literally think it's my team it's my guy versus them\nAnd it doesn't matter if my guy is why is that just shows that he's a strong leader that he knows that it's a war it's a struggle Hitler's book is called my struggle it's just a struggle and meaning comes from struggle and victory and isn't it victory\nIs a gives you value it's all about winners and so what truth does is it levels that off ... says hey it doesn't matter what side you're on there is the world and the world makes it the case that there are no sites because that's the world so you need to destroy the truth and then you just have power\nAnd fascists leaders need enemies right\nFascist leaders needs enemies because they need to be winners and there needs to be losers so you need you need them you need them because it defines us to any of them are the are the threat that you need to and you need

against his book how fascism works\nAgo just wrecked it happening in France but thankfully and checked by French society here in America politics that the pendulum will swing back\nNot necessarily the ... century it it got as an immigrant here twenty here I Am much more hostile society that I'm living here in\n... and then you're you're asked to look by gene into your tea leaves thoughts\n[laughter] so I'm not a A R I this is not what I Do look into the future a and a and I'm loath to make predictions um I mean I Would just say that we've long had these inclinations or if you look at our if you look at what's faced black America\nIt's a if you look at our if you look at what's faced black Americans are historically in the United states take fake news think of all the fake news in the Nineteen nineties that\nGinned up the machine of mass incarceration\nA super predator theory as you know people saying there was going to be a huge wave of violent crime that never materialized a but we've had all this fake news we've had all this hatred of mind of minority groups in this country we've long had these elements what we have now is we have we have\nPoliticians exploiting the these features of the United states and\n... you know making America great again returning us to a grim past yeah\nWhen you get to that with you because there's some fascinating things in your book about a Hitler being inspired by the confederacy and Jim Crow which uh\nI had never home across before um but also the idea that somehow maybe Donald Trump when he says a make America great again he saying let's get back to slavery and Jim Crow that was that's a pretty stretch for a lot of people even people who were anti Trump\nI'm I'm not seeing what else could be meant we've struggled so hard in this country and we struggled large you know with only limited success against our\nOur demons or at about it to me as as a patriotic American I mean it's an incredible story I mean the civil rights movement is an incredible story um\nThese are the the movement for gay rights as an incredible story and when someone talks about returning us\nI mean ... you know they could return us you know what we have here is is a subtle winking I mean they could be promising us a new deal\nBut we're not seeing that we're not seeing the infrastructure plan we've been promised we're not seeing Bannon's economic nationalism we're seeing giant tax cuts and we're seeing\nA transgender rights rolled back we're seeing gay rights rolled back we're seeing a ah we're seeing a vicious anti refugee and immigrant an outsider rhetoric\nSo we are seeing we're talk we're seeing the Nineteen twenty four immigration act being revived in sort of talk about revive\nSo we're seeing the make America great again that seems to be meant if not the new deal off it's not it's not government spending on a on various projects uh for for the benefit of workers it seems to be the parts of our past that ah\nThat a liberal democracy or should overcome\nBecause it'd be a citizen many people's minds just let's go back to what we had before Obama particularly maybe when Reagan was president\nAh it ah the Nineteen eighties um could that be what's meant well a Steve Bannon in the Hollywood Reporter interview specifically referenced the Nineteen thirties\nAnd a ban on a smart uh he's obviously leaves it open whether he means the new deal part of the Nineteen thirties or whether he means the time of the Nineteen thirties\nThe aspect of the Nineteen thirties\nThat America First of votes which is the time when America America first movement was essentially the face of American\nFashion is also a time when America was in a deep depression lest we forgot in Nineteen thirties you want to revoke the Nineteen thirties or in a well let me get some more callers aboard here Daniel joined us here on the air good morning\nGood morning a thank you for being guessed that read your book I like it very much I mean what you're spending time on the chat rooms and the ... can you know that there are plenty of factors in this country with the assault on an electric power and all that now I agree of course whether that makes\nThe entire Republican Party I think that's a different question my\nQuestion for you or do you consider consider Japan of the Nineteen thirties and World War two of the country and I have a problem on that as well\nWell I'd like to be clear that my expert cheeses on ideology and propaganda and I think that a ... you really need a political economist that story and a political economy\nA ... and a story in of the structure of governments to tell you a about different about what a fascist regime looks like\nUm I think you can have fascist politics without a fascist regime are now whether there was a I think\nHis rapid based on religion I mean a lot of Japanese thought it was based on shouldn't there was a ... a Saudi allergy as well received can certainly\nYou can certainly so one of the examples chief examples in my book of a fascist movement of the Hindu for movement in India\nAh which is a religious movement Hindu nationalism which is a classically it's uh our our sauce a ... ah it the party that originally sort of channel that\nAh was explicitly influenced by European fascist movements and but the idea was you know the idea is Hindu nationalism it's er religiously based movement um and I think some elements of the Israeli writes\nFar far writes I'm a ... disturbingly reflect that so you can certainly have the kinds of fascism involved in politics of purity and you know where where the fear of the other is based on the other polluting you\nAnd you ... you know so you you talk about so in fact fascist ideology like foreigners are pollutants you might talk of them as sort of a horrible\nDangers to your women as rapists or or diseases or invasions and I and you can have that based on religion you as we see in India Today you can have that based on a on skin color or\nA or a variety of ethnic sources\nIs a Islamic fascism there is Jewish fascism there is\nIn regard to combating fascism it seems like the left has an apathy problem where the Democratic party um\nTheir platform a parallel the majority of Americans want but the voting poll a of the electorate um\nThe Democrats don't really have that many left leaning of voters to choose from because a lot of the voters that aligned with Democrats are simply not voting at the same rate\nSeemingly just have one quick correction uh appreciate your question and we'll go to the professor Stanley in a moment but we did a program just yesterday was Carolyn Anderson who talked about voter suppression in the last election and made the case that\nUh Wisconsin and Florida particularly because of voter suppression probably turn the election to Trump or an electoral college I mean she does make a fairly good case for that but I mean do you live with with uh the question we're hearing from Stephen ... professor Stanley ...\nSo I I'm a huge admirer of colonel Anderson I just want to say and I think she's absolutely right I mean\nFlorida has what and I just want to emphasize your point Michael but that one point four million\nUh people are disenfranchising in Florida for a four previous felonies we're the only country on earth practices felon disenfranchisement I mean people who've committed felonies felonies are still citizens most liberal democracies prisoners vote people in prison votes\nSo when you look at that practice that uniquely American practice that arises you know basically you know [laughter] that is racially base it's a means it's connected to racialized mass incarceration or when you have\nThis current moment where we have this fear ... return to Jim Crow to to voter suppression as Caroline bison\nBrilliantly documents um we have this war on our democracy what about the caller's point\nThough is a professor sent me saying there's a great deal of apathy and the up and see if feeds into the fascist a Gemini wherever it is that\nThat's right that's right I I mean what we're seeing as we're seeing Republican Party that seeks to rule as a minority but it's still the case that we have a problem with apathy that if we got all the voters out who could vote who would vote 'em this would be\nDefeated or not the Republican Party per se but certainly the politics that disturbing sort of politics that we're seeing\nAnd I think one of the problems is a problem it's not as extreme as we saw in the Nineteen thirties in Germany but we saw different factions of the left attacking each other\nSo when you have different factions of the last one you know when you had a you know in the thirties you know when you had a far leftists calling to the center left\nYou know fascists [laughter] you know you when when you have people for all for all of a center left for all are you in the fall of\nThe ... the centrist Democrats are and I think they are there are many uh you know ... you cannot paint them in the same uh in the ... with the same brush as a president", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city": "San Francisco", "day":
