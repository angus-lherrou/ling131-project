like oh okay this is kind of interesting and and then second time when I went down there to kind of organized things I\nFelt someone touch my earring\n[noise]\nAnd it really freaked me out for that

political tribalism and stomach political tribalism we're\nTrying to assess and really reflect upon after this terrible grim weekend but also the tribalism that has gone into so many ethnicity OR Books as targets and a homosexuals\nHow's he beat the ah the list goes on and as a catalog listed it almost seems to be enlist in terms of tribal groups let me get some callers on and let me give me an Anthony ... good morning\nThe morning yeah go ahead you're on the air out\nLike that kind of herring\nRight wing extremist and what's happening right now in the ... and it left wing heritage and for example the Ernie heater is playing what about it then\nIt's ... all you have if you look at the data and far away are many more right wing string parrot pen left wing or any other country and I think an irresponsible certainly\nAgree Steve can I can [noise]\nWell I I can I I have to I can speak to this just from the standpoint of covering national politics you know and I think that the the [noise] since I was making a comparison there was just the mere is no comparison in one way that when you consider the rhetoric that Donald Trump is brought to politics\nI'm In the rhetoric that Bernie Sanders who brought to politics [noise] um I I think Trump is that have a clearly different level um\nI I think the the point there was just that it did feel happen um in in terms of a a supporter Sanders [noise] I'm trying to commit an act of mass murder against members of Congress and and I I I I think that's just you know that sort of part of the next year when when we you know\nWe we look at trying to assess the impact rhetoric has I I Do think it's [noise] you know it's it's noteworthy that that somebody not engaging necessarily in the kind of rhetoric Trump past [noise] um there were still a supporter popped up and and and did that\nBut see forgive me it's not only a rhetoric we're talking about when the president's resemble appears to be going after transgender people by\nSaying you know the ah only be judged by their genitals and they can't be part of the armed forces and you know you have those kinds of things that are hitting people directly or whether they're in favor of the president and his point of view or not but they're saying you know we're different somehow were separate and we need to be separate and we need to be less accepting endless\nAre open to simply say differences\n[noise] and this is this is this is the point though right I mean this is why we're so divided culturally when it comes to politics right now I'm ... when the president said something like that when the when the president does something like that [noise] look at the lines of division that that that form around that\nUm and it's it's on any range of issues um the it's the idea that we've never been this divided politically [noise]\nUm I I think there's there's truth to I think that's that's where we reached because it's it's it's cultural now and and it's um it's folks who who would be deeply deeply offended by the sorts of things that you're that you're talking about who are deeply offended by that\nI'm having a very strong reaction this president having a very strong reaction to the Republican Party that uh they nominated him Republican parties used members you know largely vote with and\nI'm In Congress and there is though clearly by the fact that he is president United States by the fact that he uh he did win enough votes to get elected he didn't win a majority of the popular vote but he did with enough votes to get elected [noise] um there are a lot of Americans out there um who believe he is in some way defending their values and their interest\nWho believe he is in some way defending their values and their interest\nI Want to get more callers aboard Chris you're on the air with us good morning\nYes um first of all my my biggest concern is that we have to find a strategy to\nTry and fix this problem and get through it but I'm also my thought is that you know along with you bring up Gingrich and the moral to me the moral majority getting taking all the people that use the vote labor\nOn more for more on moral grounds solve the Catholics that a lot of the um Dixiecrat\nAnd being able to get those twenty thirty million potential voters\nAnd allowing the Republicans to survive\nBut also by bringing religion into it as you know has been won by our founders religion doesn't compromise religion doesn't use science to make the decision religion is about making people feel good irregardless of the facts to a certain degree\nAnd you can't compromise and that kind of all out there were the Republicans have\nThis political party in which they don't ... they can't compromise and the Democrats on the other side we do compromise and it's I think it's really created this this division that we are\nChris let me thank you for the call and go right back to secret that can get his thoughts about the cultural and religious devised particularly the religious which Chris is bringing up because uh ironically right above packed you can in a\nRace to the president said he had and he really was inspirational and too many people in starting a kind of cultural revolution and back at that time Daniel assuming\nDonald Trump was a reform candidate running for president calling Buchanan a Nazi and also as you point out in the book or essentially being a pro choice candidate I mean it was a different world we're living in but what about just roll his Christmas bringing up here in the ... right and and really a\nPlane to that audience which President Trump has been doing consistently\n[noise] well yeah and that's you know that the legacy of Nineteen Ninety that that created the world we're living in today the the the Christian right was sort of mobilized into politics [noise] um basically in Nineteen eighty to elect a Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter who would you know called himself a born again Christian the first born again Christian president [noise]\nUm and Ronald Reagan um you'd be in the Jerry Falwell other sort of conservative Christian leaders stalked Carter was a failure rally behind Reagan\nAnd that became a growing force in the Republican Party in the Nineteen eighties and into the Nineteen nineties and and the key turning point I think in the Nineteen Ninety four mid term election next to Republican Revolution and it makes Newt Gingrich speaker\nAnd it's the first time that the entire country sorting\nTakes a step back in and look at this Republican Party with Speaker Newt Gingrich\nWith a Republican leadership in Congress that was heavily southern\nUm heavily conservative Christian I'm In and says this is not necessarily the national Republican Party that I thought it was you know that the Republican Party of a Bush senior even if a Ronald Reagan even if it Nixon before Watergate or Gerald Ford and a very different um idiot logical\nUm religious Lee oriented party and\nThere was a reaction to that I'm In that reaction was and you saw it in in the northeast you saw it in the Pacific coast you saw it in the suburbs of Chicago the suburbs of Detroit you saw it in places we talk about right now being sort of the heart of resistance energy to Donald Trump\nWell that was the that was the backlash against this new Newt Gingrich slash you know sort of Christian right Republican Party in the Nineteen nineties [noise]\nAnd that was sort of ... the root of it I think the interesting thing is that Donald Trump in the Nineteen nineties pointed himself on sort of the left side of that of that divide 'em and uh a different version of them came along about two decades later\nI'm In any ... things that he himself had denounced it in the Nineteen nineties or any one of\n'em leading and a tweet here from a listener named Heather that I wanted to reach he says I'm a counselor we have these situations are rising because like psychologist Carl Rogers Notre we need fully functioning humans to role model these behaviors for us and we don't have that in the leadership right now\nAnd there was a question we're coming up unfortunately a tour to break your uh

and you come away thinking boy right after nine eleven uh we went to war which seem a just war at the time because\nAl ... sanctuary in Afghanistan and somehow Afghanistan had to be kept from remaining a sanctuary and it was in many ways of many people's minds at least a war that should have been thought\nAnd then there was the Iraq War over weapons of mass destruction which should not have been fought in many people's minds particularly now but these are two wars it just continues to go on with no end in sight and uh [noise]\nYou come away from your book just feeling that sense of the senseless in the civil war perhaps more and foreign above and beyond everything\nWill you certainly come away feeling the drift what you just described from the outset of the wars particularly after two thousand and one uh when there was a flash of patriotism in the country and and the military and then many new recruits to the military went overseas in the aftermath\nBut once we get to the Iraq period we entered a period of distractions and then the rift it's sort of an endless reorganization of\nThe publicly stated reasons why we were in these countries are and they were conceptual failures as well in the wars which led to practical failures censor the book is in many ways about the individual experience against this larger backdrop\nFor the book gives us a real human perspective I Know that was your intention and you succeed if I may say so in day to day combat and realizing what they do to combat it entails [noise] what it involves for the individual soldiers of different services uh [noise]\nAnd I know you you're under order a under command I should say General Kelly for a while and you say positive things about him though was limited uh experience you had with him but you go after a lot of the generals and you're going through a lot of those in the Pentagon who make these policies who may tactical and\nTerrible mistakes in many ways politicians as well who are separated from the real fighting\nSo there's a disconnect absolutely between not just the generals but the whole system by which we manager wars and the people who actually fight them and that disconnect\nCertainly exist at the generals level and many of the senior officers and senior military civilian leaders who who wrecked for these wars and who in some ways still do but the failures larger than that it's our failure to as a populist our disconnect from the war as citizens\nOr in line with reality became darker than my initial concept for it\nI Wonder how uh have you read civil burns the things they carried long ago and yeah well it stays in the mind does your does it's it's it's a great life isn't\nIt pretty much that you portray here and then he portrays\nWell yes I mean I ...\nA lot of history you know you talked about generals were we were a few minutes ago a lot of the history of war too much and for my blood comes from the perspective of generals or policy makers and strategic thinkers and not enough comes from sergeants and the like people who stand near and with sergeants and\nI think that this is a history of the war from people sergeants and people in proximity to start gets that's intentional\nAnd my own inquiry on the war I mean I I work for big newspaper and we can cover the war in a lot of different ways\nAnd that allows individual reporters to specialize or differentiate have different lanes in the beat so during my time covering the words I never met David portray history Stanley McChrystal or many of the brand names never try to didn't want to\nI Want it to cover the bottom a I wanted to cover the rank and file we had plenty of people covering the Pentagon or people passing through Brussels to cover NATO I'm way people covering our allies weed people in the capitals covering the embassies and as they say in the military you know the big blue arrow uh\nWas well amplified in the press I wanted to get it the human experience down below and that brought me to the grants that also lines with my own experiences maybe where I was best\nI'm able to apply a personal ones because I'd been one of them here in the Persian Gulf War no more than that it was an infantry I spent years in the infantry and went through the same schools\nUh I went through the same schools and many of the same experiences as these young soldiers and Marines I Know the language I Know their acronyms I Know what it's like to live on the ground a\nFor a long period of time I've been in some way sort of made out of wood so I'm Still able to do that or it was during those years\nAnd I thought I should cover them because they were under represented to there'd be days one in particular I remember I was invited to go see General McChrystal and I had the opportunity instead to walk with a corporal and a squad patrol\nAnd I remember thinking to myself the general as reporters followed him wherever he goes no one ever talks at the corporal I'm going out with the corporal thank you very much\nThis is where I think a literature and I'm I'm a self confessed uh to you literary guy but where it's made a great impact of going back to Stephen Crane and\nMailers and making the dead and have any way I mean these are writers who bring somehow war to us through the eyes of those who fight in the infantry or those who are coming combatants and so forth I mean [noise]\nAh in in cases like Tim O'Brien or having to actually served in the military and they have these same experiences you did and so they're able to make a vivid and not see it from

reason for that\nBut one of the reasons why people are very busy we we get to exercise a lot of time to read and we're bombarded with all sorts of forms of media I tried to make the book so that if someone wanted to spend a few nights with just one book a few hours here a few hours there and get to the end read a few hundred pages\nThat the reader would leave with a strong\nVivid sense of many

and quick\nUnderstanding of what it's like I just want us to feel the wounds and the suffering these men went through\nOr it's bad for you there's no way to write honestly about war I'm not sure that

there inside of it\nYeah well that's that's dot Caribbean he's he's invited to go visit a former President Bush the Bush librarian Texas and he's with his family so the whole family goes and they haven't had any warning it's like you know they're invited if I remember right one afternoon under there the next morning they don't even have time to get to go get I mean they they were at\nThe Texas motor speedway in watching a NASCAR race they didn't even have time to\nDress in line with what you'd expect the dress code to visit the president and his office um\nDot Kirby was when he was there he is in in some ways\nHe was confused and felt a certain limit to how much he could say and didn't know that he'd be able to explain his experience to his commander in chief and a few minutes that\nThose types of interactions allow and so he um he ... he tried to navigate it in an understated way and not say much it was really ... mom\nWho opened up and it spent the night before in a hotel room practicing a monologue\nUh that she delivered to the to the president but she wanted some assurances and some validation that the president was aware of what these wars at cost and not just a

battled addiction depression\nPost traumatic stress disorder divorced and he had a suicide attempt and been arrested I mean his life he gone from being someone who's quite literally in his own explicit way want it to be a hero wanted to go to war\nWanted to participate was enthusiastic as you could get I mean all of his meters were pegged to the right he'd gone\nFrom that person to being someone disfigured grievously wounded in pain and despair and feeling abandoned and lonely and that and living with his family and with his parents and that of course had taken a tremendous toll on all of them\nThis toll exist in many families across the country they said it just started this nearly seven thousand Americans in uniform died in these two wars but tens of thousands more were wounded and many other unseen words as we call them you know come home with\nA psychological or moral freight and burdens that they're still working through and this is heavy upon the families and it largely has gone unacknowledged\nAnd if that's a big nose even to a greater extent if that's possible we have not acknowledged all the pain and suffering of Iraqi and Afghan families and of those who died in combat in of well all the corruption I mean when you write about uh for example you can sell a pistol a\nTo a jihadi for example and get much more than you can make working in a [noise] the

you hear me yeah we can hear you know\nI spent almost four years in the military my father was general ... pilot and World War two and for the general ... back from China Burma and there\nAre the holy land a Berlin ... a London and back to the United states in July of\nI'm a Nineteen forty five\nI'm Wondering what we can do for veterans I as a veteran type magazines over to the voluntary services at the\nA VA hospital they take the last four months of magazines or they take all National Geographic and apparently the the veterans there are a lot of the national geographic so I Want to urge all people in the bay area and act around the country to see how they\nSponsorship as a cake you eighty life's dream come from in any sleep world featuring temper Peter ... temper memory thumb can provide personalized comfort you when you have to help the night's sleep by reducing motion transfer and responding to a user's unique shape weight and temperature learn more leap world dot com\nSoon as we do know about them first you know that they do a lot for veterans a Michael Black or decided that organization and you know hats off to him and perhaps to them when I had anything here Chris\nI mean\nWhat many veterans crave coming home uh it's not just understanding because I understand it can be hard to ask for but the integration into community\nBeing in a in a combat unit a is incredibly bonding and very very very socially rich and you form these friendships and sense of shared understandings and sense of purpose that when you leave the unit\nAre cut or not at least not available to you as they once were and when you come back into civilian life\nYou're looking often for some if not substitute something they can at least fill\nA portion of that that missing feeling that you had\nAnd people get it from churches they get it from sports leagues some of them to see if you can be an adrenalin rush to camp to do well that's that's that's another yeah yeah that's not that's another element but that's not that's not the social piece that I'm Talking about as much and one of the main things we can do for veterans is just bring them back into our lives\nIntroduce yourself talk to them get to know them invite them into your life give them a job\nOr through your arm around them socially uh magazines and other gestures are helpful and welcome anything is really welcome sincere\nBut you know veterans had a community that was their unit and their service uh that was their time in their place their outpost when they were stationed in Afghanistan or Iraq or Syria or the horn of Africa or elsewhere um\nThat sense of community something um that many of them or used to and would like to have again in some way so anything that is sincere and that offers them a place is usually welcome\nI was reading about some of those who received the national Congressional Medal of honor and ah the the\nCourage under fire I mean\nYou know some of it comes from the bond that you were talking about but you know these are men who put themselves in harm's way\nBelieving almost without any doubt and ... with a with certainty that they're going to be killed but to save their buddies you know and they come through it somehow miraculously but they go right into impossible situations putting their lives at risk and these are unbelievable stories\nIt's worth noting to Michael did valor is much more common than the award system recognizes the word system is often skewed towards officers and senior enlisted\nAnd shocking about the kind of guys you writing they and then junior\nRank and file there's so much unrecognized Fowler a and with that on a recognized valor who you know people come home they vividly have these experiences in their head still and there are around us I mean three millions I said one percent of the country it's not my line them\nSuffering too many I mean suffering from ... to begin with I mean for openers but from so many flashbacks and you know her sounded the noise and I think they're under fire and [noise]\nLet me read some comments coming in just propose what you said before about the draft Michael writes we've created a class of individuals' we're doing the dirty work over and over again most of us and not have any personal connection to this activity if we had a draft there would be students and families protesting in the streets of San Francisco once again maybe even\nIn the streets in the south from where most of our troops come\nSteve says frankly my views on the wars haven't changed much at all even as a freshman in college I thought the wars were idiotic with no clear plan criteria for success in more likely to make lives worse than those countries and better surprise I was right [noise]\nSome satisfaction and say that but the sense was for many people that these wars made no sense and I think would you've suggested is if there was any sense initially for example with Afghanistan there is invaded seem to be much sense now despite the fact that there's still\nAn argument to be made that the Taliban are able to take over the country and have at least the resources and possibility is taking over their country again\nAnd we know what happened with that\nI Choose a slightly more subtle way of saying that I wouldn't want to be quite so binary rather than say they censor no sense a\nWhat we don't have is clearly articulated goal\nClearly articulated realistic goal that we all understand and share as a society and then a planned organized resources towards that goal\nIn other words we have to find the end realistic and\nWe don't know what the end would look like they've you know at the end of look like if you don't know what the end it looks like ... or how you're getting there you don't have your resources aligned with it so it feels like drifted looks and feels like drift because in fact it is drift maybe someone at the center of this knows what they're doing\nBut they certainly haven't made a convincing public case\nThat will bring some more of our public aboard here we go to a UNIX Joe you're on the air\nI yeah I I'm I'm listening to the program and I think it's great um I just want to tell you I I started over in Iraq from oh five do sex as a reservist um and and the west Iraq and that was what was called the iron hang on\nI gotta tell ya I spent a year there and everybody always thinks the hard part is going over\nA to be honest the artist are actually coming back home because [noise] it was very disconnected I'm hardly relate everything but ah I appreciate the show and\nHard to relate everything but ah I appreciate the show and I'll take your comments off line\nBy comments Chris thank you for the call\nComing home um and trying to process these things or even explain these things to others um\nIs in many ways harder than going over into going over can be hard and being there can be really hard and I think what the caller just said\nIs a a commonly shared experience by all sorts of people who went I mean one thing I'll I'll I'll risk which you're still on the line I'll risk sane is a reservist if they're in a reserve unit a\nMore National Guard unit that has the local component that isn't during in other words community members who served part time but remain living in the community sometimes can have it a little bit better because people they serve with are still around that they're not scattered fifty states um and I hope that's the case for you\nThen writes thank you for your service what are some things that were actually done right what did you just think about all the Bush administration not letting the press videotaped the caskets coming back from the wars\nShow at the tactical level lot was done right um [noise] it takes a while for tactics to catch up to circumstances and it takes even longer for equipment or to catch up the circumstances and so in these wars it probably wasn't till two thousand and six or seven where\nThe equipment the armor uniforms helmets a match the worst but it came to with time uh and the tactics of all much more quickly than that [noise] so I think there are\nUnbalanced many people at the middle and the bottom who can take\nPride in satisfaction in their roles in what they did in how they acted was what they had a lot of that was done right um and as for the the caskets a\nWell look I'm I'm obviously for the first amendment I obviously when I'm writing about war I care about war words public activity it should have as much public scrutiny as possible\nWhen you say you're for the first amendment defined that many of the soldiers are [noise] have a strong almost a religious commitment to the idea of fighting for the country being tied to the belief in the constitution the belief in liberties and principles for which this country likes to ideally stand\nMany do I mean I again I Want to be careful of universal um and when you're out with units in combat a lot of the idealism falls away and they're living their schedule their living there patrols or living with each other they're trying to make it through\nTheir tour day by day patrol patrol attack by attack",
