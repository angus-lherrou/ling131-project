protested the Supreme Court nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh disrupting the judicial hearings to express their fury with protests continuing Tuesday on Kevin O's first day of work\nThis anger is nation shaping argues journalist and bestselling author Rebecca Traister and her new book good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger and she joins us here in Studio this over to talk about a female anger has historically been discouraged and why women's collective rage has the power to transform politics welcome Rebecca Traister\nIt's such a pleasure to be here make a\nLetter to have you and I always say that we are obviously going to talk about was very much in the news we just heard center a couple of hers questioning uh FBI had Richard re excuse me Robert ... what is the first time I'm going like um but I Want to talk with you first about history before we get to the current events uh because you really lay out a case here\nUm but the heart of social progress really and ah to that extent\nUs growth being central to women's anger or being tied intimately to women's right\nYeah I mean when the super race sick [laughter] when when you look back at ... I mean to my mind nearly all of the transformative social and political movement hum that have reshaped the nation from abolition and suffrage through the labor movement\nThe civil rights movement the gay rights movement the women's in the Nineteen seventies\nReally if you go back and look at their start there were nearly always women who were not only women but but angry women who stories we often haven't been taught and if we have been taught them we certainly haven't taught been taught that they were furious and that fury at inequality and injustice was part of what spurred their\nCivic participation and their entrance into organizing\nUm and so part of what the book is attempting to do because I Do think that there is a political consequences to women's anger I think we're living in a period where you're seeing women's fury expressed politically electorally in terms of protest in striking the teachers' strikes the fast food strikes that are going on right now um\nAnd I think that it's important that we acknowledge that political value in consequence of women's anger and anger that often drives them into participation and these movements and you can and you can see them throughout history\nWell as someone who really takes history very seriously as a serious student of history I was struck by was reminded actually of a tone of Adrian riches which many people know uh [noise] which ends with a line the book in which our names does not appear in court within us in which our names are not appear diving into the wreck\nBecause you sort of argue that a lot of these names don't appear uh although they're appearing more I Would argue Susan B. Anthony Harriet Tubman names like that but\nNevertheless stories like I had the great fortune of interviewing Rosa Parks to go and as you point out it was a story about Rosa Parks me very angry and taking a brick against a young man who was taught to her and really heckling her and saying I'd rather give up my life and put up with this from you\nYeah well this is Rosa Parks is an interesting example because of course she is one of the women whose names we now but we have to ask\nHow we've been taught the story of Rosa Parks in Nineteen fifty five she refuses to give up her seat on Montgomery bus and we have been taught about Rosa Parks as and her decision to keep that seat as catalytic to to the civil rights movement I was taught that in elementary school but here's the version of Rosa Parks that I was taught\nThe powerful and often by powerful white men is it the institutions that parties are very ideologies begin to depend on on those men and it puts those who are dependent on them\nFor advocacy and leadership in a very tough position that's part of what has been fraught about me too\nSo we're talking Rebecca Traister and she's the author of good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger she's a writer large from New York magazine and\nAlso struck the by your notion that men can well we saw it in fact the in the recent Supreme Court nomination they can express anger the way a that was expressed by the nominee Brett Kavanaugh or by Lindsey Graham and went into kind of a ridge fit and everything for women like Christine Blasey Ford\nWhich is very temperate very controlled and very sympathetic or even Bill Clinton excuse me even the President Trump initially said you know she was impressive and all these water tore kinds of things we're back to the matter is\nShe had a control over so that if she has lived anger rotary Joe's would have not gone well known with Republican voters there's almost with women and men have certain rules as they can play and there's more license for men to express rage\nOh yeah I mean there's a lot of human kind of a mushroom yes\nIt is um women have a very narrow range of expression that we're told will get us taken seriously and that if we become too angry if we express our fury it will in fact undermine\nOur ability to be heard and respected we'll be hurt as emotional or crazy or threatening or scary or laughable or infant tile and you can ... you can see that actually in the way that the Republican Party\nUm and it's media are are responding to the protesters themselves there was a Fox News host to ... which was hit very out loud mouth a mob I'm screaming animals was what one Fox News host called the women who yelled through the Senate vote\nI'm Christine Blasey Ford could no more have gone in there storming and yelling on her own behalf even though I think it's it's fair to say that she has an awful lot that she might reasonably have been angry about whether it was the assault itself or the sort of\nAftermath and the impact it had on her life or the way that her name had become public and what her family has gone through since her name has become public she could have been angry about a lot of things but had she'd been\nShe wouldn't have been heard she would have been written off as out of control over emotional\nBy contrast is not just that women aren't allowed to to vent their anger and that men are is that men can use that anger as a tool to bolster the seriousness of their point\nBecause we are taught that white men especially are fundamentally rational as are normative citizens right we are taught to X to respect their age and that goes back to the founding the kind of political rage that we fetish dies in this country is the rage of the founders who are white men angry at their lack of representation\nWho's anger brought us to revolution and the birth of a new country\nAnd and that is a through line in our\n[noise] and and that is a through line in our history white men can deploy anger on their own behalf and it it amplifies that point we understand them to be reasonable we treat their anger as instructive and diagnostic telling us what's really going\nOn whereas for women the possibility of expressing anger leads to as just missing the point that they're making cars it must be coming out of emotion and this is exactly the dynamic that worked with Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford cabinet anger strengthen his position especially amongst the powerful who were in a position of pushing him through to the Supreme Court wouldn't have to be\nAlso actually medic so to say that there have been some pretty serious and dramatic changes I'm thinking about examples they use for\nWhen the rage that young women in the Parkland shooting for example your students expressed and express open like this was was extreme case admittedly but\nAlso you write a lot about popular culture and there's a little do we do for on recently and she wrote all do Wonder Woman you know Wonder Woman atomic blonde which are least there and I mean there are a lot of changes we women having more agencies and really kicking but a lot of\nAbsolutely we're in a period in which has is changing this is part of what I'm trying to chronicle and I think we thought even this week when there were such limits put on and when protesters are being called animals there was something else that was happening at the same time which is that the open the willingness to rage by for example on a Maria are Sheila and Maria Gallagher the two women who confronted Jeff Flake in the elevator\nWas so moving to so many people I think that at the same time that they may have been written off by the powerful as disruptive moms uncivil they were also acting as a communicative and binding force for so many of the masses who were furious at the kind of injustice that they were witnessing those women\nVery movingly powerfully pointing their fingers in the face of a powerful man and demanding that he look at\nThat was such a powerful expression of anger and injustice and at the same time that those in power were threatened enough by it that they want it to describe it as\nI'm sort of marginal and dangerous I think the reason it's so dangerous for them is because it worked as a communicative and and coalition building tool for so many women who felt that those women in the in the elevator we're speaking and yelling for them and that's powerful within mass movements as they begin to coalesce\nWe're talking with Rebecca Traister let me open up the phone lines and

for them one of the cage and in your book you say\nFor women the personal as political but you also make a division between the person on the political 'cause you're talking about your own personal anger and anger that comes about for example a ... on a number of a bill sort of ... examining self examining a when you came up for example with anger the New Republic\nA in an article there we don't need to go into details but let's talk about the personal and the political I mean were they fusing where they\nAre separate because for many people um the first of all is not a political sharper\nWell it's very hard especially when you're talking the book is about\nWomen who feel and express and use their anger with regard to all kinds of inequity whether it's it's racial inequality economic inequality um\nBut especially when it comes to women who are angry about gender inequality because women are a majority population it means is very real structural thing which is that every woman has men in her life and every man has women in his life\nAnd that means if you question or one a challenger change that the power dynamics\nWith regard to gender it means actually challenging and very often disrupting very intimate relationships\nAre we talking about patriarchy for the most part of it is about the word this operative\nHere we we can be talking about patriarchy I mean in general I'm often talking about white patriarchy are white capitalist patriarchy but yes within\nThe the power dynamics that come into play within our romantic sexual familial social relationships to this is one of the reasons it's so hard to to build mass women's movements because it's incredibly personally disruptive\nTo do to go through the process of getting mad at the ways that that gender inequity um gets played out in our personal relationships because it means questioning those relationships which is extremely uncomfortable and often very painful\nAnd forgive me there was a lot of economic from that too I mean women who are dependent on men or a bad for example these women are very reluctant offered to come forward because they're dependent economical\nWhich goes back to my point about when men have so much power we are dependent on them in ways that suppress our ability to to challenge them [noise]\nUm I've never been a shift though are we talking of these ships in this part of the history of the United states is a long long story of often circular sometimes are aggressive but but progress toward changing these dynamics but when so when you talk about women who are angry about about gender inequality about massaging the insects as\nIt is inherently personal in many cases but the thing that distinction that my book is making there are wonderful books including one that was published recently by sir I had to Mali called rage becomes her\nThat are about this sort of psychological dynamics that more than my book or about the ways that women are taught from childhood to suppress or or um re purpose their rage to not express it and\nMine is really interested in the political consequences of that rage some of which is personal some of which gets expressed via critique or disruption of these intimate personal relationships\nBut to political effect to the\n... in in the process of changing the rules legally and with regards to policy and changing the norms around around how power structures work\nLegally and with regards to policy and changing the norms around around how power structures were up\nAnger and injustice and anger and change and anger where women are concerned and bringing about Emily ration of those injustices in bringing about real political change those are the real topics so we're talking about ... of course talking about things that are very current than you can join us and we do welcome your involvement in the program again we're talking Rebecca Traister\nShe's author of good and bad the revolutionary power women's

sponsor of check ... bay area's season Thirteen new episodes they're Thursdays at seven thirty pm on shaky weedy channel nine\nDo with this book because there's so many messages to women\nAbout what to do or not do in terms of expressing their anger and it's all built around this idea that we have to figure out how to best work the system in which we're in a system that fundamentally doesn't make room for or take seriously our anger and I'm sort of\nTired of telling women that they're ... know do it this way to do it this way I Do it this way in terms of expressing themselves and my argument in this book is that we need to listen\nExpressing themselves and my argument in this book is that we need to listen to and value the anger of other women differently and when it comes to race I think that means that the call to white women\nIn particular to listen to and be led by the anger and the frustrations and resentments of black women to be curious about other women's anger to understand it as instructive and diagnostic and pointing towards things that need to be fixed in this country rather than writing officers angry voices as\nCrazy or scary or marginal or funny say no actually I Want to treat these expressions of anger with with curiosity and interest because I think they will be politically consequential so it's more about listening than about telling women fourteen different ways to express themselves differently\nOr even write about women's or other women and I think that's an important part of the pictures will I Want to get some more callers in just a comment from a listener since we were talking about ah well let me go to ... first before I go to a more common as ... joined us here on the morning\nI think he's much for taking my call yeah I'm going to try to remain calm through what is kind of an emotional question I just want to share a really abbreviated story I'm I'm a I had experienced um being a victim of sexual assaults on multiple multiple accounts\nBoth from um known perpetrators and unknown perpetrators about the law a left several work environment for hotel\nA work behaviors um and I bought the communicated my father the day after my wedding for several years um because of patriarchal behavior that I thought was really diminishing to my life I'm my question for you Rebecca every everything you're saying Rebecca really resonates with my own personal experiences\nUm but what I'm also curious about it I'm\nIn the in the self work that I had to do to kind of reclaimed my life and not just survive but right which I think it's\nOften something that is left out of the discussion of like how are we living on were not survivor how can we be survivor is and this gets my quest and what our productive pathways or for handling anger\nYou okay thank you for the good to hear from him I'll go to Rebecca Traister thanks Maya that's a great\nQuestion and again so much of what my book is about is about um civic participation as a channel for anger and there are so many different ways that we're seeing right now\nI'm you saw survivors and um women who were willing and men who are willing to talk about their experiences of having been assaulted or harassed\nUm we've seen simply the willingness to tell the story or to go and hold up a sign or to Yelena ... Senate gallery the the sort of um expressive pathway of protest as one option that is open you're also seeing this year women who are angry about\nUm all kinds of power abuses in channeling that anger into running for office or historic numbers of women who are running for\nState local federal positions many of them first time candidates bird into electoral politics by their anger UC women engaging in strikes UC women working on behalf of candidates I'm getting involved in New kinds of organizations um that are that are building a sort of progressive\nFramework that is not necessarily tied to the Democratic party itself\nSo a lot of the the things that I Am exploring and this happened to be political expressions of anger and ways to participate typically and politically um but I think in some cases they make correspond to your\nUm personal experience of of angry and participating within a movement like me to\nTelling your story I'm listening to other people's stories valuing the stories that they tell 'em these are always that\nPart of what we're doing is or what I'm what I Hope to do is to value that anger and and and acknowledge the ways that it feeds into our participation in our social professional and political lives\nLet me start to call her my good to hear from you let me go right to another caller and nuts and a local and now you're on the air good morning\nHigh morning thanks for taking my call and thank you so much for that very timely book on that question is about a women's rage and if it's acceptable when it concerns motherhood and children\nI'm particularly thinking activism the lowest give us when the fighting of toxic waste and love canal and they are and how she and many other self proclaimed housewives ended up taking the agent hostage and it was all because they were concerned about their children\nI think that's an excellent question I was thinking reading your book Rebecca about the mothers against drunk driving about ... who went in and shot someone who's on trial for molesting her son I mean I kind of anger maternal and just countenance a news give us a kind of freeway right\nOne of the things that's such a great question and that is such a great example that by so much of having written this book is like then afterwards remembering [laughter] oh my God I shouldn't have written about this too that's such a great example\nUm but Ah yes one of the things I write about are the forms of anger that have been more palatable than others and one of them and I think it's it's ... brand the senator from New York who said to me women can't be publicly angry on their own behalf but they can be angry on behalf of others and because\nI'm women are traditionally valued as mother's um maternal anger or is one of the most acceptable forms of political engagement and you're absolutely right to point to to that kind of environmental activism two mothers against drunk driving um mothers of the movement um\nCan I ask you a question of course when Gillibrand 'cause there's a lot of anger toward her no ... Franken because of sexually the me too movement she felt really have to condemn Al Franken yeah because you'd barely swath of the few women on the river or something to that effect\nGood yeah 'cause he had been fairly swath of the few women on the rear or something to that effect them is never really entirely clear but he stepped down and Trump made fun of him ... saying like he's weak for having stepped on [noise] wondering what you think about that anger directed to her now from from people on the left who are sympathetic to her claws\nWell one of the things that I Do write about the Franken situation at some length in the book and I'm One of the points that I'm trying to make is that among the the cost of of\nPower abuses sexual as power abuses sexual harassment whatever form it takes is not just the harm done to those who may have had\nTheir ... who may have been groped it's also the harm done within offices and workplace and institutions and and the Frank an example is a good example of that Franken's as senator who I admire very much whose politics I share who I think there's a good feminist but the accusations that were made against him were doing damage\nTo his colleagues and especially to his women colleagues in one of the one of the things that women are asked to do all the time is to police the bad behavior of men\nAs if the responsibility for that bad behavior somehow redound to the shoulders of the women who work with them and so especially for women in the Senate not ... not just catching Joe brand but lots of the women who are actually doing the work of advocating within their own jobs um for better laws around sexual harassment and assault on college campuses within the military\n... the fact that they weren't condemning their colleague as not just after one accusation but after\nThree four five six seven it was actually they were being called hypocrites and that they didn't and being accused of not really caring about the causes that they were working on\nBecause they weren't applying their standards to their colleague that was putting them in a terrible position now by the same token people accused her she was the first one to call for his resignation but only by a matter of minutes it was twenty of his colleagues\nWho called for his resignation and immediately she was just having been opportunistic which has always been crazy to me because actually they're not a lot of opportunities on offer for women who take on powerful men they are very frequently our beloved men they're frequently punished for it as Julie brand has been but the options on offer to those women weren't great because if they hadn't condemned him\nThey're very work would have been undermined further you know for years to come I think we would have seen that within the hearings I'm Brett Kavanaugh if Franken had been sitting on the Judiciary Committee it was like Ted Kennedy sitting on Anita Hill's Judiciary Committee\nIt would have been difficult for him to open his mouth without the ideological opposition saying well how can you talk about this 'cause you're still here and you didn't faze consequences\nI mean I think that these ... the thing that's not clear to a lot of people is it the options for the women who were Franken's colleagues were crappy in both directions either way they chose it was going to it was going to do damage to them and that is a really unfortunate byproduct\nOf sexual harassment and the impact that has not just on the accused or on the people who are bringing the allegations but on those who work around them\nHe wrote about Harvey Weinstein and you know compared to how we want to sort of Al Franken seems almost a\nThis was I guess we created a lot of anger a seems to\nBe a very different part of the spectrum I guess there's comment from just goes is female rage politically one sided I'd like to find common ground between liberal and conservative women but I feel like there is more ridge coming from the Democrats with this time how can we be United to bring about change for all women regardless of party affiliation\nWell it may feel as though there's more rage coming from Democrats and a lot of the a lot of the political rage I write about in this book is is fundamentally progressive but that is not to say the elements rages progressive in fact\nThe rage of conservative women white women um has been extremely potent in the past you know if you think about Phyllis Schlafly who led an army of angry white women who were angry at the disruptions provoked by the second wave women's movement um\nA cake weedy support comes from we work whether it's an office suite of satellite office overseas or an entire rage queue we work can find a space it works for any business more about their new San Mateo in San jose locations and we got co slash cake you ...

wealthy and keep unskilled immigrants\nImmigrant labor I should say trapped in poverty he doesn't want to close the borders completely but instead advocates for skills based immigration policy and he joins us in Studio to discuss\nHis new book and views on immigration welcome right ... thank you so much for having me delighted to have you in the Saturday adds a listener as a as a provocative title um\nBut it's really a book that aside from being provocative or really takes on a vexing and ever increasingly polarizing issue of immigration at least offer some solutions um\n'cause you come from a from a somewhat conservative standpoint because you are of the with the national review and identified as conservative politically but\nLet's talk about really what you're advocating here because my some people's lights or it may be seen as very different than conservatism may be seen as as rational and untenable or\nShould also mention that this was a personal book you grow up in Brooklyn and you\nGrow up in the immigrant community um called Kensington and so it's a personal story as well but let's talk first of all about the ideas here um because I think they're challenging and listeners want to hear what they're about\nSoul idea of hardworking immigrants succeeding in finding the American dream has become harder and harder and uh I think that's your point that were maybe finding ourselves with the release was Panama to a permanent underclass\nOf immigrants who are unskilled and therefore let's talk about immigration and not necessarily opening the borders were getting immigrants here who are indeed skilled and speak the language [noise]\nI guess my chief concern is that when we talk about immigration we often make big generalization that are not sensitive to the fact that immigration is a differentiated phenomenon immigrants like anyone they start life either with big advantages or disadvantages that shape how they navigate American Life\nThe American labor market and also crucially how they're able to shape the lives of their children we are highly unequal\nHighly stratified society and in this stratified society you have some immigrants who are being incorporated into the middle class and the affluent classes and you have other immigrants who are being incorporated into a working class that often feels really stuck\nAnd that's a right at the heart of what you argue here that they're stuck and they're stuck even more perhaps because of automation because of outsourcing because of the changing nature of labor and they can't necessarily move forward into the middle class so what do we do about that we change\nWho comes into the country which is of course being done by Donald Trump to a great degree in fact you pretty much on the same page Trump is talking about Norwegians for example and all that people who are educated people who don't necessarily come here because of family ties I Do\nOur guest is Reihan Salam and he is executive editor of the ... of the national review and also the author of melting pot or civil war son of immigrants\nMakes the case against open borders now you've also written about an immigrant or by the name of the coyote hula twenty seven year old and in some listeners may remember the name Bangladeshi like you are ... went to Kensington the same\nNeighborhood you grew up in in Brooklyn a and a factor was a young man who tried to essentially kill many people with uh my detonating or\nSomething a device a New York post authority bus terminal people may remember that it was back in December twenty Seventeen\nHated the United states he had an allegiance to Islamic state and when he came very didn't hate the United states it was drawn in by things on the Internet is this representative of perhaps would we have to fear with this underclass or is he may be just an anomaly\nYou know I think that um he is not typical uh he does not represent the vast majority of immigrants and in my opinion he uh you know definitely was an outlier\nBut I guess one thing that's really important to keep in mind is that [noise] you know we tend to be pretty naive we think okay well we have this group of people who are disciplined or hard working who come to change their lives\nBut then in fact not all of them are thrilled by the thought of living life on the bottom rungs of society and I guess you know one big difference between this gentleman and me is that I you know I was born in the United states and my family\nUm they came to the United states at a time where they absolutely did struggle but they felt like they had some opportunities to climb the ladder\nThey felt as though you know my father's case he was able to you know work as a civil servant both my parents were two jobs they were able to do that they were able to afford a home in Brooklyn New York now that is something that is so far out of reach\nFor lots of working class folks when you look at recent ... immigrants\nTo New York city one really striking phenomenon is that you have folks were living in the basement apartments are living in illegal dwellings they're not doing this because they're bad people are doing this out of necessity in our big cities right now are big productive prosperous cities cities that have always been gateways to newcomers\nThese cities feel like places where you have so many traps in your ways so many things that prevent you from climbing and again if you're someone who is a newcomer you've decided that's what I Want to do I'm going to navigate that landscape\nFair enough if you were the child of someone who's done that you're someone who was born in this country you are someone who is a citizen you have the right to expect to be part of the kind of middle class mainstream you have the right to dream that you might be able to achieve a leadership role in our society\nWhich was you suggested that dream was unfulfilled a or block to afford it it can create more autonomous and more indignation and more hatred\nExactly that is exactly right I think that what you're seeing right now in a lot of these cities is you're seeing this kind of combustible sense\nThat these dreams are being deferred these dreams are left unreal lives and I really do believe if you're looking ten Fifteen Twenty years in the future you know we talk about Donald Trump's populism the populism of you know let's say older white folks living in the heartland and what I anticipate is a new populism\nComing out of the second generation folks who feel excluded\nFrom the elite and I think that there's going to be a lot of anger in some cases justified anger like I Do have a class almost in some ways I guess that's your hypothesis yes absolutely and look I Do not believe this is inevitable and that's the whole point of my book I Want to prevent that from happening I Want to have a successful\nMulti racial society that truly is a middle class melting pot\nAre you in favor of a wall a mistake\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by as a Gen preventing miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... theater at ... dot com\nImagined that technology is going to be a bigger part of it but I actually think the wall is way secondary to unscrupulous employers who basically gained the system or flagrantly violate immigration laws and by the way\nEmployers who violate immigration laws tend to also be employers who violate minimum wage laws in a variety of other laws\nThat are designed to protect workers regardless of skin color regardless of where they were born so I really think the focus has to be on employers rather than on you know folks who are basically just responding to the economic incentives created by unscrupulous employers\nDoes some of those us reduce employers should get the chanting lock them up a ... and they don't necessarily a actors tuna deadly that is a government as as they could particularly maybe\nNow I'll put a sharper point out that when you're looking at the history of immigration politics mean out of state what you'll see is that Republicans\nWould you see is conservative Republicans who will talk of big game about immigration enforcement and talk to a big game when it comes to enforcing against individual migrants but you will not talk of big game when it comes to enforcement against employers and I think the bats are huge source of a pack receive a and I think it's it's a big problem\nAnother big problem though is uh up until recently when things started to go economically a little down to the south are coming up from the south from Mexico that isn't a coming into the country illegally and I think the wall\nThe whole idea of the wall was to stop that flow or to do something about it you could come up in your book was something that we've discussed it a number of times here on the foreign programs that is\nWhat was discussed specifically the idea of a Marshall Plan really to put to implement something that would make Mexico more economically autonomous and give them a greater half with respect to providing for their own citizens and you talk about a centrally the kind of ideas that it comes from the new president Lopez Obrador I'm\nAmbitious investment projects which seem to you to be a good idea but they're not to the president\nI Am hugely grateful to you for raising this I find it really fascinating if you look at a Lopez Obrador he is someone who says look I Do not want people to feel desperate\nIn their desire to emigrate from this country it's fascinating when you look at to Sweden or in the Nineteen hundreds this was an era when the Swedes felt we have lost so many of our young people we have lost so many of them to the United states\nThat is part of why we decided we're going to invest in the human capital of our young we're going to build a government that is more inclusive and you know yes we will engage in some redistribution\nThey decided we do not want to lose those human resources and I believe that Lopez Obrador it's someone who feels the same way about uh the native ... at his country but the natives of his country\nAnd I believe that that's an attitude that it's very complementary to the attitude of Americans are saying that we want to invest in our young in are vulnerable and folks who have been kind of shut it off to the side and I think that that could be the beginning of a great partnership\nI in fact you say the idea of going north uh [laughter] the colossus of the north as is often called a shouldn't come necessarily from necessity or from desperation it should come from choice\n[noise] ... it's also there's another dimension to this that we don't often talk about so there are one million US retirees residing in Mexico\nAnd my sense is that that number could be much much larger and that's something that could really create economic opportunities in Mexico\nParticularly for folks with more modest skills want to kind of climate economic ladder and it's something that would be humongous leak helpful for Americans who need labor intensive services but who find that that can be really expensive\nThis is going to become a bigger issue in the years to come because when you're looking at older Americans this is becoming a more diverse group\nAnd you have more of them who have origins in Latin America who might really welcome the idea of retiring overseas well I'm\nGoing to welcome you our callers and give you an opportunity to join this conversation like to hear from you like to hear your responses to what you're hearing and like to hear any questions or

about\nThe skills and the endowments that you bring with you to the United states so I passionately and strongly agree with ... and he also was making the point that yeah when you're talking about unauthorized immigration actually\nThis is not just a phenomenon of folks coming from Latin America you have folks were visa overstay years you have folks from a variety of different countries\nIncluding from South Asia one small correctional make is that a year most said that you know my parents are from India\nThey are from ... and that's not just me being a stickler\nOn ... so here's the thing\nImmigrants from Bangladesh have often been more working class than immigrants from India buck because I look like an immigrant from India\nPeople assume that I come from a certain kind of background\nPeople I attribute positive stereotypes to me and there are other groups there people who belong to other groups where they feel as though they're burdened by negative stereotypes I feel like that's really profoundly unfair and that's part of why I play such a heavy emphasis on this idea of the melting pot\nI I'm so grateful to you because I and I promise you I think this book is is honestly for you because I Do not buy into this idea that immigrants from let's say Latin America are bad and immigrants from Asia are good I think that that's a poisonous and really negative idea and ... thank\nYou for that call let me get to another caller here for us with an as or they're too good morning Ari good morning\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen preventing miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October nine through November fourth that the patron or for your theater at the gym at ... dot com\n[noise] um and so it sort of in contrast to go after Iran I Want to know is that the way around say Central America a\nLot of mileage if a round of the U.S has a sort of ethical or historical responsibility to migrants document that are not from those regions giving U.S foreign policy in the eighties and how negatively they that the U. S. as in that region historically\nWhat I've tried to do in this book is take a more ... view because I Believe that when you were looking at these discreet immigration questions they are powerfully related to other questions of class and mobility in American Life I don't mean to Dodger question but but here's what they mean by that\nWhen you're looking at immigration to the United states right now there is a component of immigration is explicitly humanitarian in nature that is our asylum system which does not work terribly well by the way and a refugee system\nNow one of the tricky things is that people who enter the country lawfully people who acquire green cards about two thirds of them entered the country simply by virtue of family ties and many of those folks who enter simply by virtue of family ties oftentimes are in need of safety net benefits\nNow my belief is that if you said okay for people who are not coming in through these humanitarian programs if it was expected that they are going to be more self sufficient they\nWill be able to provide for their families I actually believe there would be more openness to immigration on a humanitarian basis\nThe problem however is that in a way we've muddied\nThe difference the distinction between these two categories uh and I do believe that that has had a really big impact\nOn the kind of politics the political economy at immigration when you look at some other societies wherever they have\nUm you know kind of a ... call it a mainstream immigration system that is more based around a economic contribution narrowly understood those countries tend to be countries that are a bit more open to humanitarian immigration and to private sponsorship\nAnd other things that actually make people a little more sympathetic to the idea so I really think that it's important to think about this in a more holistic way\nAnd again if you just joined us our guests this hour is right on Saddam and his book is\nMeant the melting pot or or civil war son of immigrants makes a case against open borders or is that the really the options you see that binary melting pot or civil war there were some of my mind is going back to Eldridge Cleaver said the melting pot is a myth to begin with you know that we don't really have a melting pot in America we never have but that aside\nA strange these things one remembers a ... but I mean first of all are we really just talking about this or that a total binary\nYou know Michael when you talk about the melting pot and this is one thing that I I really tried to drive home in the book\nOne reason why people are so skeptical about the idea is that for most of American history\nThe melting pot was a whites only affair the melting pot seemed like something that you know it was kind of so inclusive it seemed inclusive of people who looked a certain way but not as people who looked another way\nAnd the argument that I tried to make in this book is that you know what happened is that we departed from the melting pot because in a way we thought okay we're not actually going to do that we're not going to make the sacrifices it takes to have a truly integrated society and what I'm arguing is that we don't have a choice we must do that because I really do think the choice is stark\nIf we do not embrace this ethic of an intermingled integrated society\nUh then I think you're going to see our current divisions deep and further\nSue writes I Am a die hard Democrat but I Am listening to try and find myself agreeing with a lot of his theories when you think about it\nAt its core of the left's arguments seems to be that we should enable people to come here so we can give them a court appointed legal help and destroy the fabric of their lives to give them what exactly I'm a public school teacher I see a lot of this firsthand\nAnd John says he thinks he does protesting much he makes me wonder why he has no Democrat [laughter] um I don't know if you want to respond to that\nYeah sure I mean it's very simple uh I guess my core idea in this book\nIs the idea that we need to think in multigenerational terms that in my mind is a kind of fundamentally conservative idea it's this idea that you know look it's almost anti idiot logical it's this idea that we need to do something that seems reasonable humane and sustainable and frankly it's not super idealistic\nWhen I think about the left what I admire about the left but what I just don't relate to on the left is this deep idealism of William F likely junior the founder of National Review would\nTalk about this I give him an enticing the F get on that is creating a perfect world a perfectly just world I just don't think that's possible what I'm concerned about is creating a decent world given the fact that we're all flawed beings and and that's what I'm trying to do here you know there are some ideas in this book that might strike people as hard hearted\nWhat I think is that they're hard headed\nThere's less really calling for open borders though I mean is this a false argument to some degree I mean you cited a bunch of academics perhaps and others who\nBut when we talk about the left we're talking about a major kind of political force in this country and you've come out I think very critical particularly of well Social Democrats and people who abide by this idea that the government ought to provide and the immigration ought to be more flowing\nWell Michael I disagree with you there a little bit in that I actually really strongly believe that the government has an obligation to folks who find themselves on the bottom runs of our society my issue is the tension between two things\nWhich are concerned about that increasing and look how many more gas right\nExactly so you know I mean you know Bernie Sanders I think it's talked about this in a pretty thoughtful rigorous way he's had to apologize for it to some extent but he said look you know he described open borders or the Koch brothers\nHad to apologize for it to some extent but he said look you know he described open borders or the Koch brothers plot\nEr and you know that that wasn't necessarily the fairest way to put it may be but I Do think that there was some basic logic to it the idea that when you're trying to gain some kind of social contract being thoughtful and being a little stringent and being a little tough about how you welcome people into the community is important you see this with Social Democrats in Europe\nIn Denmark um you know increasingly in Sweden they're moving in this direction they're recognizing that actually you might jeopardize some of those community ... sensibilities that under bird a government that tries to kind of guarantee some modicum of a decent a dignified life for all\nWhen you say uh you know we're going to take a headless approach to openness now okay you know this idea that um you know there aren't really folks on the left saying these things I've got to say I just have to wonder you know [noise]\nMaybe I'm just living in outer space because I Do hear these arguments all the time and I think they are becoming more prominent rather than less and they're coming from passionate idealistic people a ... and those are the people in a way I wanted to address I wanted this book to speak to kind of too big audiences\nOne audience is people who really do not like the idea of an out of control immigration system and I wanted to say to them\nI agree with you but also we need something that's going to work for every one that's going to kind of achieve some kind of majority consensus and the folks who said I Am compassionate I Love immigrants\nI wanted to say to them I'm with you identify with you I'm from these communities but I Want you to be a little more hard headed and again recognize that there has to be some kind of compromise to avoid this civil war that I described so I wanted to speak to two different audiences\nAnd I've got to tell you Michael speaking to more than one audience in this climate is extremely extremely hard over\nMore ... than we've ever been especially on this issue and let me bring some more callers aboard and David we go to you next welcome\nI think I think that uh get unemployed or is this is really interesting I have a maybe a slightly different take um I've always thought of the immigration problem in air quotes that the problem that we have a lot of people who want to come here and jobs we desperately need done\nOn terms that are favorable ... somehow we've been in front of a problem and I think part of that issue is that the\nNext step after you come here to get a green card which is a long term semi permanent commitment I'm Wondering is a better compromise wouldn't be a very very widely worker bee the program I'm here there's reliability around the state here you're not going to be taken away from your children\nFrom animation and video

more than most people realize it's a bully pulpit to not only takes the governor's job is there is a governor away or a vacancy but also sits on these words as I mentioned in\nWho was on the land commission and also there's an alternative and coastal commission and I'm sure it's on the California condition for economic development so this is a good deal at stake here and I want to begin by asking you you and I'm just going to lock is have many things in common you're\nBoth progressive Democrats you both pretty much share a lot of physicians where do you see the major difference between you and her\n[noise] so I think that first of all the major difference would be the experience I've had in a government that is being elected official for you know like the California state assembly in two thousand\nSix and then the California state Senate and then serving eight years the chair of the Senate health committee and I think what makes me uniquely qualified is going into the office and then kind of talking about what you said ... you know the lieutenant governor's office does but more important I I Want to stress what I Want to make of the office\nAnd what I Want to make up the office is bring that experience I have governing from being in government from the worst economic recession to good economic times and work with a new administration\nWorked with a new in his rations

because I've been\nThrough all the budget I Know the legislature I have the relationship and I have the relationship of all the interested parties whether it's labor consumer group you know health plans I mean you name it all the years that I work whether it's taking on huge issues in health care\nTaking on and passing landmark piece\nOf legislation I Want to work with this new administration hopefully that being a given ooh from\nWell we're talking at her ... and we've got some callers we want to get you on his views we can and Greg your morning\nBarney thing you know I'm\nLike you know it should be talking about you know\nPutting more people I'm I'm a\nPublic service and whatever and you know when you're in California that one third of the population on public service already running every ... children are on public service and I don't hear anybody talking about raising the minimum wage for a living wage while we get people out of poverty by increasing the amount that they make and they can't pay off their student data they cannot get ahead\n[noise] so what we've done in the legislatures we passed a historic minimum wage bill Fifteen dollars an hour and a if it's going to go up to that point everything we did a couple\nOf years ago and I agree what we need to do and I think the road economic success has got to be through the middle class [noise] think about our society right now in California in this country you know very very small percentage of the population owns the majority of the wealth\nAnd if we're going to move away from individuals in public service what better way than by investing and you know middle class but more importantly low income students to be able to\nAchieve the ... their college education and by addressing the master plan of reducing the cough and I'm you know if it gets to free education um then there's less student debt because the cost of students is not just education\nWe really have to have a conversation and the cost of education and you mentioned his early housing\nTransportation books food we have more college students right now that have food insecurity mental health issues we have kids that are you know having mental health issues there's a lot of things that we really really have to look at to make it better for kids to go through\nWithout dead or less debt so they can get back to society\nAnd there's another caller and that's the seeds joined us\nHigh and it just so wonderful vision you're you're putting out there but it seems to me like like the the voters or that that need to to back you are the ones that aren't being reached and I'm just wonder what your plans are to reach you know the under served that that could swing it that way\nYou know I mean I'll tell you run in the size of

in her\nCampaign she has four of her own uh you've got about two point one and I'm Wondering what kind of the other than that is that when and also like to ask you though Utah contributors are from labor for the most part and frankly I'll be blunt about it does make you beholden to labor\n[noise] no not at all so you know here's the thing until we have\nFrankly I'll be blunt about it does make you beholden to labor\n[noise] no not at all so you know here's the thing until we have in this country or in this state you know campaign finance where they're publicly financed here's the hard reality is the hard reality is\nWe have to raise money for like two officials I don't have the luxury and are being independently wealthy that I can write my own\nMy own check you know and think about her wealth you know the four million or five million she's given herself and then the independent expenditure her dad did in the primary of close to five million I Can't compete with that\nBut that's the system that we have and yes I have to take money from\nAll entities to run a campaign and I'm at a at a disadvantage and that's why we're doing the people part we're\nDoing Internet we're doing social media we are doing Facebook I'm traveling in the state you know I've got to get my message out in on a media buys throughout the whole state of California it's expensive you know but does that make me beholding no not at all I think that's just the system\nThat we have in the end of the day\nI make my decisions which I Believe and the best interest the number one Mike my district\nAs a representative them number to the people the state of California\nWould you push for a virus and form a public financing if you're listening to them\nI mean I pushed for it since I got elected\nTom Loni Hancock a colleague of mine who turned out he believed to three years ago I signed on to some of her bills voted for him you know they never made it to the governor's desk and you know until the public is willing to have that conversation this is the system we've had for hundreds and hundreds of years\nSo I like it you know do I like making fundraising calls no but it's what what I gotta do to to serve the public you know when I was an up I'm Still in a ... but you know I made a decision\nThirteen Years ago when I decided to run for office uh I gave up expanding our practices you know creating more wealth to serve the public you know at the expense of making more money and for me it's worth it because of the accomplishments I've done as a state legislator\nLet me get another caller born from LA Michael joins us Michael you're on\nYes a senator Hernandez at you know in fact your your biggest financial supporter is Blue Shield of California and I know that because I served as a Blue Shield\nPublic policy director and while serving as Bush of public policy director I Know that you are carried to build that were written a Bible shelter and I'm Wondering\nWhile I understand the need for candidates like you to be able to accept money from interests like were shelled and labor should there be more transparency about that trip for example the public know about your sponsorship of those uh shelled belt\nUm uh what what's your ... you know how how do you think it's appropriate for legislators to carry legislation that is proposed by a campaign finance search\nYeah I mean it's ... it's important that is transparent and it is transparent if you look at all of my filings every single filing that I've done since a day I got elected you can see every single ended a individual\nCorporation entity that's contributed we're now what's called twenty four hour reporting period\nAny check I get over a thousand dollars has to report it you can go into the secretary state Web page every piece of legislation I ever introduce sponsored not sponsored whether it's you know consumer groups whether it's labor whether it's somebody from the district\nOr its its shows on the legislation that sponsor and as we move legislation and yeah I've I've sponsored legislation from\nThe AIDS foundation to Planned Parenthood to labor to you know consumer groups to you name it because as ideas come to me and it's I'm chairman of the health committee\nThey make sense that are in the interest for the public to control healthcare costs and or to make sure there's better access of course I'm going to introduce bills\nCenter we got very little office little time left but let me follow that up with another uh this is a tweet from seasons when asked about covering the cost of universal healthcare you're only mention how close we were in the cheating goes a percentage or he did not answer your question of how he would cover the cost\nI think that's accurate and you know we all can you talk about the costs they do that sure\nYeah the way we would cover it is more transparency in uh the costs are pharmaceutical drugs we got to look at consolidation of markets you look at hospital systems perhaps maybe if you think about what we're doing right\nNow we're requiring that every single person\nHave buy health insurance were not required that you buy an iPhone or you know a product but by requiring it and its responsibilities government to make sure we control those costs and that's why you introduce whether it's all peers databases I've already she looked in introducing bills to look at consolidation of markets I've ... I've introduced bills\nTo bring down costs when the prescription drug companies the work they're still more work to be done but I Will tell you you know with regard to a health care there is no state has done what we've done in regard to health care like California we're the leader in number one\nControlling costs despite the fact that you know they still continue to grow up compared to other states but have reduced the number of uninsured in the state of California\nJust one quick items because if you're elected you'll be on the coastal commission a you'll have a role in uh I think pretty slowly in the Republican I says to the coast aren't you\nVery much so I think the public coast is the most pristine and precious thing that we have I Will do everything I can make sure that it's all belongs to the Republican yeah definitely\nDr center thank you very much money as a candidate for California Governor senator represents the twenty second Senate district\nAnd we're going to have another segment ahead we're going to talk about\nMaria woods and the lawsuit that his mother\n[noise]\nThat absolutely they were but ... and that's true and that those are facts that have to be considered but at the same time he wasn't doing anything with a knife\nHe was an attack in the officers I mean the fact that he had a knife that doesn't mean you're going to kill them the question what did he do at the time that that made you have reasonable belief that your life in danger or the lives of other people the fact that he was walking away and he hadn't done anything to them or anyone else that they had seen\nIn fact he wasn't very in a passive when he was first contracted by the place they never threatened and that may never said anything that he wanted to hurt any of them to do the fact is a jury have to consider in terms of their assessment which is what we want them to do\nAnd you want them also to hear from Iowa was mother who is a really the spokesperson for this case is moving forward now I'd like to hear something actually from his mother\n[noise] and that's why my own I don't know I Am young and\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nIt's pretty hard running to embarrass you want to come in\nYeah I mean we had ... have been taken it and I must tell you that you know she was a mother who was dedicated to her son\nAnd she has suffered immensely as a consequence of that ... or damage the loss of life that she had a with him and they're like you could have had with him she recognized it was a kid that and had issues that she was working with and trying to work with and you know it had a difficult time you know being a single mother trying to raise him but\nOne thing about this kid he had a parent who loved him his dad was dead and already passed he had two brothers but the mother was always trying to help him get through various kinds of issues it very much a product of the [noise]\nWhat I consider the injustices that exist or the disparity that exist within the criminal justice system in terms of how people get symptoms that are very early age but now we're standing that his mother was a supporter of him\nShe tried to get him to do the right thing she was trying to help them work through the various demons that he had but the two of the matter is once you get caught up in a system you know there's there's a path that makes it very difficult to recover why he put in a criminal justice system in a very young age and so but but as a as a mother\nAnd you can't ask for a strong personality that her\nWell let me bring our listeners into this and give you an opportunity to weigh in if you are indeed prompted to\nDo so I can tell you how you can do that right now it's all free numbers available number to call his eight

willing woods is with us and also Alex ... justice reporter for the news is here in Studio and Alice what these recent California laws regarding release of public a body cam video that we talked about what you recently there's going to impact future cases only says\nWell yeah I mean I think it should because while most of the time when we talk about that long we are talking about body camera video a but it as I understand it it's broader than that if it involves any kind of\nRecording I'm of a a critical incidents like this like an officer involved shooting where someone is killed 'em and so you know it it could very well change the\nAmount of lag time there is between when an incident occurs and when we see a video in this case with this particular video you know it's an almost a three year lag [noise]\nUm I also wanted to talk a little bit we've we've talked some about like the city's position as it pertains to this lawsuit and I think we did invite them by the way and they declined accurately yeah and I think accurately describe you know what their arguments are\nBut there is another position that the city of San Francisco and city officials have taken you know and did take directly after the Mario would shooting outside of the context of a civil lawsuit which is just like the city's official reaction [noise] um the San Francisco police department led by the police commission or rewrote\nUse of force of rules the rules that officers are required to follow when engaging a suspect like this\nUm directly as a result of the Mario would shooting and also their recalls I Know John Burris made them um and ah the former police chief made them the former mayor made them all to the U.S department of justice to step in\nA directly after the Mario which shooting in that did happen in the form of a review which is still guiding uh the changes in the U.S up you know what about\nThe fact that a disclaimer yes going back in may so there was insufficient evidence to charge the officers and found a\nLet me ask you speak to that or you know although I did have some real discussion with the ... the dish returning about this and I and I disagree with that decision likely not so much on the question of murder but I thought that he could have easily charged voluntary manslaughter on this on on the theory that the opposite may have had a good faith belief but there was unreasonable\nBut that doesn't go to the civil case at all\nThe criminal case with the da's looking at really is one of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that have got the criminal standard the civil stand and we're talking about civil rights involving lesser standard that it's a preponderance of evidence in terms of proof\nSo it is often we have cases where the district attorney does not filed charges but we maintain and successful and a lot of these cases a civil cases of that and to federal civil rights of states' rights cases so\nThe fact that there'd be a ... do Internet itself meant nothing to me because I also know that ... looking at for different reasons and often the da da da na ... close case or a close case they don't want to lose\nAnd you know you almost have you have to have a irrefutable evidence that we had an Oscar Grant case ten years ago and there we had a video\nThat clearly show that option that measure like pull his gun out and shot this kid in the back and later the jury concluded that it was a um a involuntary manslaughter on a theory that he must have made a mistake\nSo there was always the willingness to give the police the benefit of the doubt and I recognize that and and and these criminal cases and so therefore we're the only option a family and frankly\nA civil war you know with a civil case otherwise it there's no recourse whatsoever for them but let me just say I I was very very strongly\nAnd very strongly involved in working with the with the fed and trying to get the officers citizen community um port community policing that come in\nAnd and I thought they did a really good job of and dinner fine um areas and the department they needed help unfortunately as real question about how much effort has been made to implement some of those changes but that was a good first starting out granite\nGranted it was out of the Obama administration where you really had a a commitment to these police reform issue because I've been involved in a number of states and I thought we had a real good\nThing going in San Francisco to at least look at these issues there try to prevent the use of\nForce and racial profiling issues which I'm also very much part of from occurring again I Know cheap Scott has indicated he has a commitment to it and and now it's been turned over to the state attorney general's office to sort of implemented but I'm a ... it hasn't happened yet as far as I could\nSee you know we did speak with uh the chiefs and that's a that interviews in our cars let me get our colors on here though and begin Donald's with you Donald welcome you're on the air\nThank you [noise] um I I look at the videos and I'm I'm Glad that this other a video that gave another angle was revealed as a former a police trainer training manager [noise] um we were always in training\nMy officers never had to you can pull their weapon I just don't understand policing in America today except for\nThe backdrop of the text messages and so forth I think that explains a lot of the other problem that I have with San Francisco is due process of law for victims of crime beard being ignored I've been a victim several times of crime in San Francisco I Know what it looks like\nAnd I've been a victim and I'd been ignored by the San Francisco police department and it is cost we barely financially ah emotionally\nHow do you not respond when nine one one call [noise] I I just think that that's the issue that out to be\nKnown as soon as we are taking up a previously on on slum Alex he looked like he wanted to say well I I mean I think the\nCaller mentioned some context that I can maybe a ... explain a little bit I mean I think he's referencing um [noise]\nYou know and and he was really a series of these two different uh scandals that emerged out of a San Francisco police department where officers were exchanging text messages amongst you know each other\nUm that we're a very biased incredibly racist violently racist in some cases um and and that is in that ah those tax message is the first iteration came out I Wanna say six seven months before the Mario World shooting 'em and so
