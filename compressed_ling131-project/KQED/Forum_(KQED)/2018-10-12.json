pot or civil war National Review executive editor Reihan Salam argues against uncontrolled immigration any challenges what he sees as a growing movement of\nCosmopolitan extremism to use this phrase that aims to dismantle us borders the son of Bangladeshi immigrants or sell them believes that the melting pot in America\nThe ideal of the melting pot has been derailed by the reality of social and economic barriers which benefit the wealthy and keep unskilled immigrants\nImmigrant labor I should say trapped in poverty he doesn't want to close the borders completely but instead advocates for a skills based immigration policy and he joins us in Studio to discuss\nHis new book and views on immigration welcome right ... thank you so much for having me delighted to have you and decided to add to listeners a it's a provocative title um but it's really a book that aside from being provocative or really takes on\nA vexing and ever increasingly polarizing issue of immigration at least offer some solutions um 'cause you come from a from a somewhat conservative standpoint because you are a few with the national review and identified as conservative politically but\nLet's talk about really what you're advocating here because my so people's lights or it may be seen as very different than conservatism may be seen as as rational and untenable or should also mention that this was a personal\nBook you grew up in Brooklyn and you grow up in the immigrant community um called Kensington and so it's a personal story as well but let's talk first of all about the ideas here um because I think they're challenging and listeners want to hear what they're about\nSoul idea of hardworking immigrants succeeding in finding the American dream has become harder and harder and uh\nI think that's your point that were maybe finding ourselves with a release was Panama to a permanent underclass of immigrants who are unskilled and therefore let's talk about immigration and not necessarily opening the borders were getting immigrants here who are indeed skilled and speak the language\n[noise] I guess my chief concern is that when we talk about immigration and we often make big generalization that are not sensitive to the fact that immigration is a differentiated phenomenon\nImmigrants like anyone they start life either with big advantages or disadvantages that shape how they navigate American Life\nThe American labor market and also crucially how they're able to shape the lives of their children we are highly unequal\nHighly stratified society and in this stratified society you have some immigrants who are being incorporated into the middle class send the affluent classes and you let other immigrants who are being incorporated into a working class that often feels really stuck and that's\nA right at the heart of what you argue here or that they're stuck and they're stuck even more perhaps because of automation because of outsourcing because of the changing nature of labor and they can't necessarily move forward into the middle class so what do we do about that we change\nWho comes into the country which is of course being done by Donald Trump to a great degree in fact you pretty much on the same page Trump is talking about Norwegians for example and all that people who are educated people who don't necessarily come here because of family ties\nBecause uh you know again these are things that have built up over a very long period of time and they become really contested\nOur guest is Reihan Salam and he is executive editor of the editor of the national review and also the author of melting pot or civil war son of immigrants\nMakes the case against open borders now you've also written about an immigrant or by the name of the coyote hula twenty seven year old and in some listeners may remember the name Bangladeshi like you are ... went to Kensington the same\nNeighborhood that you grew up in in Brooklyn a and in\nA fact was a young man who tried to essentially kill many people with ah my ... or\nSomething a device a New York post authority bus terminal people may remember that it was back in December twenty Seventeen hated the United states he had an allegiance to Islamic state and when he came very didn't hate the United states was drawn in by things on the Internet\nIs this representative of perhaps would we have to fear with this underclass or is he may be just an anomaly\nYou know I think that um he is not typical uh he does not represent the vast majority of immigrants and in my opinion he uh you know definitely was an outlier\nBut I guess one thing that's really important to keep in mind is that you know we tend to be pretty naive we think okay well we have this group of people who are disciplined or hard working who come to change their lives\nBut then in fact not all of them are thrilled by the thought of living life on the bottom rungs of society and I guess you know one big difference between this gentleman and me\nIs that I you know I was born in the states and my family um they came to the United states at a time where they absolutely did struggle but they felt like they had some opportunities to climb the ladder\nThey felt as though you know my father's case he was able to you know work as a civil servant both my parents were two jobs they were able to do that they were able to afford a home in Brooklyn New York now that is something that is so far out of reach\nFor lots of working class folks when you look at recent ... immigrants\nTo New York city one really striking phenomenon is that your folks were living in the basement apartments there living an illegal dwellings they're not doing this because they're bad people are doing this out of necessity in our big cities right now are big productive prosperous cities cities that have always been gateways to newcomers\nThese cities feel like places where you have so many traps in your way so many things that prevent you from climbing and again if you're someone who is a newcomer you've decided that's what I Want to do I'm going to navigate that landscape fair enough if you were the child\nOf someone who's done that you are someone who was born in this country you are someone who is a citizen you have the right to expect to be part of the kind of middle class mainstream you have the right to dream that you might be able to achieve a leadership role in our society which was you suggested\nThat dream as unfulfilled a or block to afford it it can create more animal is in more indignation and more hatred\nExactly that is exactly right I think that what you're seeing right now in a lot of these cities is you're seeing this kind of combustible\nKind of combustible sense that these dreams are being deferred these dreams are left unreal lives and I really do believe\nIf you're looking ten Fifteen Twenty years in the future you know we talked about Donald Trump's populism the populism of you know let's say older white folks living in the heartland and what I anticipate is a new populism coming out of the second generation folks who feel excluded\nFrom the elite and I think that there's going to be a lot of anger in some cases justified anger like do ethnic class almost in some ways and I guess that's your hypothesis yes absolutely and look I Do not believe this is inevitable and that's the whole point of my book I Want to prevent that from happening I Want to have a successful\nMulti racial society that truly is a middle class melting pot are you in favor of a wall [noise]\nUh I'm In favor of enforcement on the border uh I think that you know kind of what form that'll take you know physical barriers will be part of it but I imagine that technology is going to be a bigger part of it but I actually think the wall is way secondary to unscrupulous employers\nWho basically game the system or flagrantly violating immigration laws and by the way\nEmployers who violate immigration laws tend to also be employers who violate minimum wage laws in a variety of other laws\nThat are designed to protect workers regardless of skin color regardless of where they were born so I really think the focus has to be on employers rather than on you know folks who are basically just responding to the economic incentives created by unscrupulous employers\nThat some of those unscrupulous employers should get the chanting lock them up a ... and they don't necessarily\nA actors tuna deadly that is a government as as they could particularly maybe\nNow I'll put a sharper point out that when you're looking at the history of immigration politics mean out of state what you'll see is that Republicans\nWould you see is conservative Republicans who will talk of big game about immigration enforcement and talking to a game when it comes to enforcing against individual migrants but you will not talk of big game when it comes to enforcement against employers and I think the tax and huge source of hypocrisy and I think it's it's a big problem\nAnother big problem though is uh up until recently when things started to go economically a little down to the south are coming up from the south from Mexico that is and are\nComing into the country illegally and I think the wall\nThe whole idea of the wall was to stop that flow or to do something about it you could come up in your book was something that we're discussing the number of times here on the foreign program and that is\nWhat we've discussed specifically the idea of a Marshall Plan really to put to implement something that would make Mexico more economically autonomous and give them a greater half with respect to providing for their own citizens and you talk about\nA century the kind of ideas that have come from the new president Lopez Obrador\nAmbitious investment projects which seem to you to be a good idea but they're not to the president of\nA hugely grateful to you for raising this I find it really fascinating\nIf you look at a Lopez Obrador\nHe is someone who says look I Do not want people to feel desperate\nIn their desire to emigrate from this country it's fascinating when you look at to Sweden or in the Nineteen hundreds this was an era when the Swedes felt we have lost so many of our young people we have lost so many of them to the United states\nThat is part of why we decided we're going to invest in the human capital of our young we're going to build a government that is more inclusive and you know yes we will engage in some redistribution\nThey decided we do not want to lose those human resources and I believe that Lopez Obrador as someone who feels the same way about the native ... uh his countrymen natives of his country\nAnd I believe that that's an attitude that is very complementary to the attitude of Americans are saying that we want to invest in our young in are vulnerable and folks who have been kind of ... off to the side and I think that that could be the beginning of a great partnership\nAnd in fact you say the idea of going north uh [laughter] the colossus of the north as is often called a shouldn't come necessarily from necessity or from desperation it should come from choice\n[noise] well it's also there's another dimension to this that we don't often talk about so there are one million US retirees residing in Mexico\nAnd my sense is that that number could be much much larger and that's something that can really create economic opportunities in Mexico particularly for folks with more modest skills want to kind of climate economic ladder and it's something that would be humongous leak helpful\nFor Americans who need labor intensive services but do you find that that can be really expensive this is going to become a bigger issue in the years to come because when you're looking at older Americans this is becoming a more diverse group\nAnd you have more of them who have origins in Latin America who might really welcome the idea of retiring overseas [noise] well I'm\nGoing to welcome you our callers and give you an opportunity to join this conversation like to hear from you like to hear your response as to

about\nThe skills and the endowments that you bring with you to the United states so I passionately and strongly agree with ... and he also was making the point that yeah when you're talking about unauthorized immigration actually\nThis is not just a phenomenon of folks coming from Latin America you have folks were visa overstay years you have folks from a variety of different countries\nIncluding from South Asia one small correction I'll make\nIs that a year most said that you know my parents are from India\nThey are from Bangladesh and and that's not just me being a stickler on ... so here's the thing\nSo here's the thing immigrants from Bangladesh have often been more working class than immigrants from India but because I look like an immigrant from India people assume that I come from a certain kind of background people I attribute positive stereotypes to me\nAnd there are other groups there people who belong to other groups were they feel as though they're burdened by negative stereotypes I feel like that's really profoundly unfair and that's part of why I play such a heavy emphasis on this idea of the melting pot\nI I'm so grateful to you because I I and I promise you I think this book is is honestly for you because I Do not buy into this idea that immigrants from let's say Latin America are bad and immigrants from Asia are good I think that that's a poisonous and really negative idea\n... thank you for that call let me get to another caller here forth with this or that you good morning\nAri good morning I'm\nMike ... is the focus of your of your book and you're purchasing very much about what's best for American society going forward in terms of the more skilled based immigration um and so it sort of in contrast to go after her ear ma I wanted to know is that the ... around a Central America a salad or Guatemala\nIf a ... of the U.S has a sort of ethical or historical responsibility to migrants document that are not from those regions giving U.S foreign policy in the eighties and how negatively they that the U.S has impact that region historically\nWhat I've tried to do in this book is take a more so than optic view because I Believe that when you were looking at these discreet immigration questions there powerfully related to other questions of class and mobility in American Life I I don't mean to Dodger question but but here's what I mean by that\nWhen you're looking at immigration to the United states right now there is a component of immigration is explicitly humanitarian in nature that is our asylum system which does not work terribly well by the way and a refugee system\nNow one of the tricky things is that people who enter the country lawfully people who acquire green cards about two thirds of them enter the country simply by virtue of family ties\nAnd many of those folks who enter simply by virtue of family ties oftentimes are in need of safety net benefits\nNow my belief is that if you said okay for people who are not coming in through the humanitarian programs if it was expected that they are going to be more self sufficient they will be able to provide for their families I actually believe there would be more openness\nTo immigration on a humanitarian basis\nThe problem however is that in a way we've muddied the difference the distinction between these two categories uh and I do believe that that has had a really big impact\nOn that kind of politics the political economy at immigration when you look at some other societies wherever they have um you know kind of a call it a mainstream immigration system that\nIs more based around a economic contribution narrowly understood those countries ... countries that are a bit more open to humanitarian immigration and do private sponsorship and other things that actually make people a little more sympathetic to the idea so I really think that it's important to think about this in a more holistic way\nThen again if you just joined us our guests this hour is right on Saddam and his book is\nMeant the melting pot or or civil war son of immigrants makes a case against open borders or is that the really the options you see it that binary melting pot or civil war that we're in fact in my mind is going back to Eldridge Cleaver said the melting pot as Mitt to begin with you know that we don't really have a melting pot in America we never have but that aside\nA strange these things when remembers a ... but I I mean first of all are we really just talking about this or that a total binary\nYou know Michael when you talk about the melting pot ... and this is one thing that I I really tried to drive home in the book\nOne reason why people are so skeptical about the idea is that for most of American history the melting pot was a whites only affair the melting pot seemed like something that you know with kind of photo inclusive it seemed inclusive of people who looked a certain way but not people who looked another way\nAnd the argument that I tried to make in this book is that you know what happened is that we departed from the melting pot because in a way we thought okay we're not actually going to do that we're not going to make the sacrifice if it takes to have a truly integrated society and what I'm arguing is that\nWe don't have a choice we must do that because I really do think the choice is stark if we do not embrace this ethic of an intermingled integrated society\nUh then I think you're going to see our current divisions deep and further\nSue writes I Am a die hard Democrat but I Am listening to try and find myself agreeing with a lot of his theories when you think about it at its core of the left's arguments seems to be that we should enable people to come here so we can give them\nCourt appointed legal help and destroy the fabric of their lives to give them what exactly I'm a public school teacher I see a lot of this firsthand and John says me thinks he does protesting much he makes me wonder why he has no Democrat [laughter]\nUm I don't know if you want to respond to\nYeah sure I mean it's very simple uh I guess my core idea in this book\nIs the idea that we need to think in multigenerational terms that in my mind is it kinda fundamentally conservative idea it's this idea that you know look it's almost anti idiot logical it's this idea that we need to do something that seems reasonable humane and sustainable and frankly it's not super idealistic\nWhen I think about the left when I admire about the left but what I just don't relate to on the left is this deep idealism of William F Buckley junior the founder of National Review would talk about this I give him an enticing the F ... that is creating a perfect world a perfectly just world I just don't think that's possible what\nI'm concerned about is creating a decent world given the fact that\nPossible what I'm concerned about is creating a decent world given the fact that we're all flawed beings and and that's what I'm trying to do here you know there are some ideas misspoke that might strike people as hard hearted when I think is that they're hard headed there's less\nReally calling for open borders though I mean is this a false argument to some degree I mean you cited a bunch of academics perhaps and others who\nBut when we talk about the left we're talking about a major kind of political force in this country and you've come out I think very critical particularly of well Social Democrats and people who abide by this idea that the government ought to provide an immigration ought to be more flowing well\nMichael I disagree with you there a little bit in that I actually really strongly believe\nThat the government has an obligation to folks who find themselves on the bottom rungs of our society my issue is the tension between two things which are concerned about that increasing and look how many more examples right exactly so you know I mean you know Bernie Sanders I think it's talked about this in a pretty\nThoughtful rigorous way he's had to apologize for it to some extent but he said look you know he described open borders or the Koch brothers plot\nEr and you know that that wasn't necessarily the fairest way to put it may be but I Do think that there was some basic logic to it the idea that when you're trying to gain some kind of social contract being thoughtful and being a little stringent and being a little tough about how you welcome people into the community is important you see this with Social Democrats in Europe\nIn Denmark um you know increasingly in Sweden they're moving in this direction they're recognizing that actually you might jeopardize some of those community ... sensibility is that under gerd a government that tries to kind of guarantee some modicum of a decent and dignified life for all\nWhen you say uh you know we're going to take a he'd list approach to openness now okay you know this idea that um you know there aren't really folks on the left saying these things I've got to say I just have to wonder you know [noise]\nMaybe I'm just living in outer space because I Do hear these arguments all the time and I think they're becoming more prominent rather than less and they're coming from passionate idealistic people\nAnd those are the people in a way I Want it to address I wanted to smoke to speak to kind of too big audiences one audience is people who really do not like the idea of an out of control immigration system and I wanted to say to them\nI agree with you but also we need something that's going to work for every one that's going to kind of achieve some kind of majority consensus and folks who said I Am compassionate I Love immigrants\nI wanted to say to them I'm with you identify with you I'm from these communities but I Want you to be a little more hard headed and again recognize that there has to be some kind of compromise to avoid this civil war that I described so I I Want to speak to two different audiences\nAnd I've got to tell you Michael speaking to more than one audience in this climate is extremely extremely hard over more\n... than we've ever been especially on this issue and let me bring some more callers aboard and David we go to your next welcome\nI think I think that the get go get unemployment is really interesting I have a maybe a slightly different take um I've always thought of the immigration problem in air quotes but the problem that we have a lot of people who want to come here and jobs we desperately need done\nOn terms

I wouldn't have the objectivity and so that was a challenge for me and I I I really set about are trying to see if I could bring him to live\nHow did some of your preconceived notions about Reagan change in the course of writing well\nYou know it's it's interesting people ask me if I Would vote for Reagan now after spending six years of my life working on this\nCourse I'm safe too liberal to get the nomination of the current yet had already\nPerhaps that's true um I wouldn't vote for him now because you know I'm a Democrat or I don't adhere to was politics yet\nUh my perception didn't change because I came to really admire him as a man and and his leadership capabilities in this country and as George Schultz said to me ah you know his his most enduring aspect\nOr is this fundamental decency and I really think that's true about the man he really have the American uh the American people at the forefront of his uh of his vision\nCertainly wasn't in politics I don't think to enrich himself\nBut you know he he he he starts to see and she took me through this that are those are the real communist were poisoning the wealth\nAnd uh they were separated themselves from the the democratic liberals and and really causing a lot of the unrest in Hollywood and that's when Reagan begins to pull away and he starts to ... to the right\n[noise] talking with Bob spits his new biography is titled Reagan and American journey I'm Scott Shafer here today for Mina Kim and one of the things of course are one of the big moments for Ronald Reagan in Hollywood was falling in love and Mary Jane Wyman who broke his heart in a way\nShe did break is hard I mean there are ... and his spirit in in a lot of ways as well that that marriage was a typical Hollywood marriage they didn't know much about each other\nThey were both working separately in different movies um for a while they rarely saw each other\nBut really what drove that marriage apart was the fact that Reagan would never shut up about politics um it drove Jane wind and crazy if he was on the set and there was a break in the takes Reagan would\nPull cast members together and talk politics if they went into the commissary for lunch the actors would wait to see where he sat down first so they didn't have to get an earful politics through art\nAnd at that point is politics for what\nOh they were they were to the lab they will they will really democratic politics yeah and and Jamie Hyneman couldn't take it anymore\n[laughter] I remember when I was running for president there were a bumper sticker that said Jane Wyman was riding high now well there you have it yeah so uh so he at some point or where they get divorced but they've had a couple of kids yes smile and Maureen right yes\nMichael they adopted and Maureen was with the natural child and they um\n... why did they adopt Michael you know with the story of\nWhat nobody knows I'm I I I think James found out that she couldn't have children again\nThat was my guests are but I have no idea why they adopted Michael [noise] um and ... or they always said you know there are too many children in the world which it adopt but uh nobody ever knew personally why why they did\nThat and they had a difficult relationship I think Michael and his father all through\nHis life I mean it never stopped a Nancy really wanted nothing to do with Michael in Bahrain and in fact uh there's there's a quite an interesting story when Michael was graduating from high school\nA Ronald Reagan was Reagan was the speaker and as Michael comes up to get his diploma Reagan gives them the diploma shakes his hand and says and what is your name young man and he looks up and he said that it it it's ... it's Michael ... and that really sums up there we\nGo out and he wasn't wearing glasses out a so he's big break if there was one in Hollywood because you really never broke out in the way a lot of stars did of that era but he plays new rock need the giver Nineteen forty uh how did he get that role and and the you know what do you make of it\nYeah it ... the producer absolutely didn't want Reagan he wanted anybody but Reagan because Reagan wasn't a star they really wanted a star so what Reagan did was he suited up in his own college uniform\nHe went into the producers office unannounced and he threw a few bullet passes on his own college they form and and the producer said okay you know actually he wanted to play new\nBut um but he got the giver and never really realizing that the real give her was a rapper date you know he smoked he drank\nHe had illegitimate shoulder and he he gambled on his own games that he played in so that kind of whitewashed that but Reagan the love that role\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by essay Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October ninth through November fourth ...

I always liked to say that Ronald Reagan wasn't a deep thinker but his thinking was deeply felt a um I I think one of one of his strong points is that he knew he was humble enough to know\nThat he didn't understand complex issues so we hired very good people it's the one thing that Trump has not done but I Will say Reagan hired experts to give him advice and he was smart enough to listen to them one\nOf the things of course Reagan was best known for was his ability to give speeches and he he gave some great speeches and I'm One of the speeches he gave was in Nineteen eighty six or when the space or the challenger disaster happened that blew up on Tom launch\nA and he gave a speech uh that really United the country let's listen to this one of the more famous lines\nYou know the crew or the space shuttle challenger hunter just for the men with which they live their lives\nWe will never forget them\nNor the last time we saw this morning\nAs they prepare for their journey and waved goodbye\nAnd slipped surly bonds of\nTouch the face of God\nThat speech of course famously written by Peggy Noonan right her his speech writer\nUm [noise] ... did he Reagan see the presidency largely as a performance\nWell you know the one thing he knew how to do is use soaring rhetoric\nOr we hear it in that speech he knows what's going to connect with the people and ah I I think I'm his acting I think that being an actor and we're seeing it now and currently I'm reaches people who\nAre either are well versed in politics but they appreciate the performance [noise]\nAll right let's go back to the phones and again the number is eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six if you have a question or comment for Bob spit and we'll go to Palo Alto John welcome\n[noise] hello I find it really ironic that many of the things that are being said about Trump today a word fed about Reagan or they called Reagan or a ... a warmonger reactionary professor\nOr you're going to set up ... for your crack her ... her I vaguely remember that and the rallies millions of people across Europe\nHer her ... her I I remember that and the rallies millions of people across Europe the United states um Central Park\nFactor thing regular set up ...

calling for an end arms sales to the Saudis potential sanctions ad investigations into the suspected murder of Silicon Valley congressman or O'Connell says it's time to reexamine the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia which President Trump yesterday called excellent\n... the allegations are very serious that the Saudis are engaged in human rights abuses against a journalist who is an American residents and it calls it the question that our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nJoining us now to discuss developments in the story is Barbara quiet usher she is a State Department correspondent for the BBC she joins us from Washington DC good morning good morning well let's begin with the latest this was a story that was changing overnight or what do we know this morning what's new\nWell what's new is that a Saudi delegation has now arrived in Turkey for talks on the case they're going to be meeting their counterparts\nUm we don't exactly know where that will lead in terms of the status of negotiations but as you mentioned a we have\nBeen hearing from reports in the Washington Post that Turkish officials say they have audio and video recordings now that captured the act they strongly suspect as you mentioned\nThat Saudi hit squad has killed and dismembered and Mr ... inside the country did and they say these recordings show how he was interrogated tortured and murdered their\nUm the other element is that there's a standoff over ... over searching the country that the Saudis had said the Turks could search it but then according to a Turkish newspapers they wouldn't let the Turks he's a chemical that can discover blood traces they only wanted a visual a search so they are trying to resolve that\nUm basically I should say that officially we don't know very much this is all based on leaks and from the Turks and also from from some from U.S intelligence the Turkish leadership\nHasn't formally accused Saudi Arabia but the president has called on Saudi Arabia to prove that Mr ... she left the building up its as he did and\nTell us for those who haven't been following this very closely tell us a little bit about him and why something like this would have happened to him\n[noise] but you know she was a prominent journalist but he was also somebody who had been involved at various levels in the Saudi Government as it as an advisor to senior government leaders in the past in fact even here in Washington at the embassy\nSo he really knew um how things work he was sort of a member of the establishment really on what at the same time being a columnist and journalist [noise]\nUm and he had initially supported uh Mohammed bin Salman who's the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who came on board is this young\nThat the United states who's going to lose interest in Saudi Arabia and lose interest in defending Saudi Arabia from regional a competitors including but not limited to you Ron I'm and\nThere was a sense of uncertainty as to whether the hostility they felt under the Obama administration was merely President Obama or whether really\nThis relationship which had been foundational to the way the Saudis think about\nNational security for Seventy years what is it going away in many ways the crown prince is greatest accomplishment\nSince he's been in government uh have been rebuilding the U.S Saudi relationship has been being seen in the White House being seen with Jared Kushner being seen as somebody can come to the United states for several weeks at a time and meet with all the elites everywhere and in many ways\nRelieving ... how to use that in fact the U.S relationship wasn't going away and reaffirming Saudi Arabia's place in the world because the crown prince have been able to to demonstrate close relations with the White House in the event\nThat this all seems to be going south and the crown prince rather than building up the relationship is dividing the relationship do have profound consequences for the standing of the crown prince and the kingdom because rebuilds cause this relationship is universally believed to be important\nAnd rebuilding it was one of his great accomplishments damaging it would be very damaging to his own prospects\nHow does the fact that the Trump President Trump than that you mentioned Jared Kushner I mean they have unlike past presidents and presidential families they have a direct financial ties\nAnd interests with the Saudi Government right\nHuh I'm not confident enough to say they have direct ties with the Saudi Government certainly there are people from\nThe guardian invested maybe Saudi investors they've stayed in a Saudi\nGovernment has paid for rooms and in Trump Hotels you can decide that that influences the president or not I think you know in some ways what I saw from the body language is they feel they understand each other the the sort of you know the Davos class seems almost thread bear\nTo people who talk about by yachts and paintings and all those things and I think that there was a way in which they felt that they were among peers um\nAnd it's a way I saw it from outside and I can't speak to the president's motivation to what he's really thinking to my sense so much more of it was a sense of finding an emotional\nConnection and a personal connection rather than a financial interest I I could be wrong but that's the way that's the way it looked to me\nYeah and and of course uh this bipartisan group of senators of sent a letter to Trump urging him to reconsider the arms deal with Saudi Arabia and the president seems completely disinterested in that said that\nLook if they don't buy those arms from us they'll take their hundred and ten billion dollars somewhere else like China or Russia is that that a mistake\nHuh\n\nHere's what's coming up

math you have to buy an awful lot of candidates to offset that hundred dollars and it doesn't do anything with the excise taxes\nWith the city tax ah with all the other factors you still have to pay all the taxes I'm\nAnd I'm a medical use or and so I have really been priced out I see a at least a third of them increase [noise] um and [noise] a lot of my friends aren't going to the black market they think the taxation is out of control\nThey know what's going on in Colorado and they see this as a as a losing situation the more than a price to pay taxes staff that more people are going to try to um [noise] ...\nYeah let's go David yeah but there's not one candidate consumer out there the most vociferous and easily the most impact it has been the medical consumer on a fixed income when you have cancer a major condition you don't have a lot of extra money lying around and every dollar counts and um the people that have really taken on the chin since January first have been those medical consumers with a genuine need\nIn addition to them you have a bunch of recreational consumers who are looking for convenience who are looking\nFor safety and purity and are looking to stay above board and legality and\nThey're the ones that are going to save time and effort and mental stress by going to some of these stores in pain a premium for that\nThe caller mentioned Colorado I mean how do the other states like Washington state to legalize this um how are they dealing with these taxes\nThat's a great point because what happens when you legalize cannabis is the price can drop by fifty percent or more and so even though tax rates were membrane high in those states the price of the candidates has come down so steeply\nThat it absorbs those taxes so in Colorado or an Oregon for example they're paying fifty dollars per ounce of cannabis that compared to five hundred dollars here in California\nSo we think over the medium to long term a lot of the pain from the taxes is going to be absorbed by the cost reductions\nYeah All right back to the phones and Johnny in San Francisco welcome you're on with David ...\nThank you very much Johnny ... campus retailers lion we are now on the um this is a targeted attack against the industry where we haven't really seen the results you know if you've got fifty times\nPack of a normal retail business and when we're trying to normalize something like this I think the act packed with something that we really need to consider need more data\nA second thing I'd like to say is that the higher taxes\nCertainly will feel the unregulated market data comes out to Oregon\nShowing that when flower prices dropped forty one percent over a year failed went up Fifteen hundred percent so speaking of David point there there is an algorithm where lower taxes actually will equal more tax revenue we have no idea how big the unregulated marketed\nAnd so when we continue to attack intact and tax people are just going to go by candidates from their body around the street you know David\nYeah well you know um he brings up a good point we have this homeless measure on the ballot that would levy\nTaxes on bigger businesses to generate funds for homelessness and when you look at the growth rate grocery seats ... rocket attacks there they're looking at point one Seventy five percent or point six nine percent\nIf you're a business over a billion dollars in revenue you're looking at one point four percent payroll tax and these are massive businesses either the Twitter and Facebook are we have you\nSome of these smaller businesses are going to be looking at any ... like five percent so you know who the he's right these taxes are going to be ten ... any other industry and we've seen that the cannabis industry tends to be second class citizens even posts legalization and um it's been a long time coming for places like the chamber of commerce\nTo to ride to their defense and we're seeing both in San Francisco chamber of commerce on the rights so to speak and the brownie Mary democratic cup for cannabis on the left both you know say no to property\nRight now are Johnny thanks for the call again the number if you want to join us eight six six seven three three sixty Seventy six or we got some listener comments here Julie says a tax cannabis yes but at no higher than twenty percent for all taxes combined to temper sent out the door tax pushes the total\nHigher than twenty um think you would uh you're doing do the math I don't know that\nI think we're going to have to look at overall what we mean by taxes grocery seats might change prices might be going down um there's gonna be new and novel ways to be considering how to take you know these taxes and that is it might be deep coupled from grocery seats which again are going to continue to fall as a price falls\nAnd how would you know if you use one of these delivery services I mean obviously you have to pay for the delivery but like how does that do you avoid any taxes that way\nWell I mean ask yourself about the Amazon delivery tax debacle nationally the issue of where attracts asking takes place in where it's delivered in where the taxes are paid has been one that's been ended up in the courts before and it could end up back in the\nCourts again [noise] All right here's another a listener who tweets the legal system is working fine as is the higher the taxes the higher the demand for the black market which of course is zero tax\nHigher the taxes the higher the demand for the black market which of course is zero tax a good point where they're they're they're sort of a make making a much higher profit I guess you could say a although taking more risk as well\nThat's right and you know consumers are getting clean tested pure candidates and the legal supply chain and they will be willing to play a premium for it when we think about the medium to long term we could see the price of cannabis become lower than the taxes and fees on top of it so the most\nYou know you're the twenty dollars you pay at the register for ... the majority of that is going to be the regulatory baking costs as opposed to the per unit cost of the cannabis\nIs that true I'm sure it must be for cigarettes right now\nSure and you and you just think about agriculture in general this is a cannabis plant it's a weed um the inputs are relatively low think about how much your tomatoes cost and then imagine all the tax regimes that you could put on tomatoes and you could see how tomatoes he'll be two dollars a pound but then the taxes can be Eighteen [noise]\nAll right let's go back to the phones and and in San jose welcome\nHi I Am I right to get married and I don't think that marijuana or alcohol or very healthy or even back a healthy body but I did go yeah here we go I in marijuana\nThat we could do like we did with tobacco increased and ... and also get the tactic going when I hear high tech marijuana I like yeah I Am so happy about it and I like your\nSpeaker can't talk about what does it compare with marijuana a history of taxation versus the back of his taxation\nThey win I think about marijuana taxation I think about the marijuana tax act which is how probation started in the thirties\nAnd if you remember your civics teacher telling you the power to taxes the power to destroy and so the ... plan was to destroy marijuana commerce in their thirties through a tax rate that was too high to pay\nThat's the history of marijuana taxes in California I'm not as up to speed on tobacco taxes but I have a sense that they are higher now than they've ever been in the history of tobacco and we really love plowing those tobacco taxes into messaging in public health\nSpending a route to reduce tobacco damage to society which is interesting here is that um San Francisco's taxes would just go into the general fund they wouldn't be earmarked for mental health or homelessness or use or that kind of messaging and\nUm some cities and counties across the state our ear marking taxes for that but most of them are just going into a general fund and opponents say this is a city hall money grab you know and it's it's not earmarked for what is going to do\nAnd what would you say the ants points that uh you know that maybe taxes are a good thing because it'll be a disincentive to use a product that may not be good for you\nYeah um I Would say that we totally tax vices in in you know it's a societal thing to do that\nThe danger is a precedent you're setting around grocery seats taxes that are really high you know everyone's okay with a ten percent Fifteen Percent cannabis tax suck those businesses who cares but it's really easy to wake up the next day as a legislator and go you know there's other industries that have a bigger and disproportionate impact on armed Californians health and safety like", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "12"}
