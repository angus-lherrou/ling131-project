assembly district Fifteen will choose their next assembly member Richmond councilwoman ... Bek goes on political strategist Buffy ... her both vying to represent the East Bay district which stretches from North Oakland in Alameda County to Hercules in Contra Costa county\nThe race between ... and which has become one of California's most competitive and expensive legislative races and it's a race that political junkies across the country are watching closely since a deck of those divisions within the Democratic party with Bernie Sanders our revolution organization endorsing buckles and Brock Obama endorsing wicks\nToday and for them in this hour we're joined by the two candidates for assembly district Fifteen and we'll hear their views on some of the state's most pressing issues from rent control to education but first we're going to hear from ... California politics and government reporter guy must already and why this racist garnering so much attention where the funding is coming from in\nIn a very expensive race let me welcome guy back to the program the heavier good morning Michael and we should say the moderator to debate between these two candidates without which I'll be doing in this hour um\nLet's just talk about generally the sense of how this is being I'm essentially frame between what I guess you could call more democratic socialist candidate a Bernie Sanders centers camp and Hillary Clinton kind of traditional democratic candidate I pretty much fits the bill\nSure and I think this is something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago before reforms a that allowed for a top two primary we're seeing now to Democrats in the general election I'm In a very blue districts do in you know in the past this would have been a debate really condensed for a primary\nNow this debate as you say divisions between different Democrats on policies like housing and education are allowed to spread all the way through the general election\nAnd yet you look at the physicians and we'll hear from the candidates are on on so many things they agree more than they disagree I mean they're both uh we had a debate on proposition ... which is essentially to do away with Costa Hawkins and uh we find that they're very different in terms of their approach to that and to health care and education but you know in so many things they seem to be\nPutting homelessness at the top of their agenda and housing and both in favor of single payer I mean there are a lot of things I Would say more that they agree about\nAbsolutely and I think ... like you said that the priorities of the two candidates are very similar and reflect the issues that people care about in this region in in this district which includes Oakland Berkeley Richmond housing is at the top of that transportation\nUm healthcare as you said both candidates support a single parent health care um and yeah so I think what's really tend to find the campaign as those issues with you know within the differences between those issues I'm On something like housing in rent control which has divided the candidates\nWe have also just as a city council we've approved another project on twelfth McDonnell which will build again my bringing up a turn for bringing that up we're working on it and do those things take years we know that since the\nSince it you know redevelopment funds were halted years ago that that that help that made us have to figure out ways to build the of the Ford will housing that we needed um and we are working with non profit development ah ah organizations to help build these\nAre for the housing that's now in the in the pipe quick\nQuestion would you like to see redevelopment reestablish\nI Would I I don't you know I Would love to see that we we were able to build a ... when we had those resources unfortunately uh we we no longer have those resources but that's that's okay because my platform I talk about a building hundreds of thousands of new affordable\nHousing within the next ten years as you're in a a next to a assembly member\nAnd we can do that we have the resources to do it we are\nThe fifth largest economy in the world we have the resources to be able to do that and I I Am we are as a council I as a council member\nUh we do to collaborate with nonprofit housing developers and none of them have said that passing prop ten will will hinder grow so I'm not sure what my opponent as I talk\nTo your direct question would you be in favor of redevelopment being\nRaised him and I also just want to point out you know we're in a housing crisis right we have a severe shortage of homes for about two million homes shy of where we need to be\nAnd if you look at my opponent track record she was voted down on many housing projects she abstained on one hundred percent affordable hundred and fifty five unit housing development that we desperately need and so to me this is a major issue and when you're an elected official and you have a shorter amount of time and\nAnd I'm I'm energy and political capital you're so focused should be on solving this crisis and my opponent has spent time pushing things like passing a resolution making Richmond\nA safe haven from government mind control you know that's not what our elected officials should be doing we should be focused on building a home so we need solving our homelessness crisis and that is where it you know if I was in her role I Would be spending my time doing exactly\nJust where we got to start sending a lot of issues are and you're a mortgage evocative groceries laughing your last name because\nYou know that's really pretty preposterous out of the fact that I found a hundred percent affordable housing love to eat and I have talked about this on several radio shows that that is not that that is a is it's a it's really twisting the fact the fact is and we said before\nThat I abstain on a developer\nThat have taken advantage that was on ... in several cities in Oakland and San Francisco and so of course I'm not going to vote for a developer a vet with with you know that that doesn't have any scruples\nAlso when we as a city council abstain from using that developer we van eyes and voted a four developer or that that was trustworthy and had the integrity or to work in in in my city in my city which has a majority city of color\nAnd so uh to say that I you know you for bringing the continuing to bring that uh it it really want to know a no no no ma'am it did not and I we I abstained on that project\nAnd we then voted we've been voted for another developer or that would do the job of a of of uh with some integrity\nYou seem to be somewhat are often as you wrote or at least a strong about developers are menu\nSponsorship of the cake you read the life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with extended beyond demand\nMajority city of color and so uh to say that I you know you for bringing the continuing to bring that uh it it really didn't want to know a no no no ma'am it did not and I we I abstained on that project\nAnd we then voted we've been voted for another developer a that would do the job of a of of uh with some integrity\nYou seem to be somewhat are often as your other good least a strong about developers are I mean you do see a lot of them is not necessarily being scrupulous and well\nThis particular developer was yes there are several ah articles about it and and that's why we as a city council a turn down that particular developer but then we then voted on one that we we knew would be doing the job the right way I'm with that\nWell let me go to another issue that I think you to have a considerable difference was where there aren't that many really I mean it sounds like a good campaign and it is but you're pretty much the same page on a lot of major issues are served to measure already [noise] um\nBut you you were both in favor of single payer but again there's a sense of moving incrementally or moving exactly in the fast lane and listen to talk about why you feel you can do it in the ... and when you first you know\nI feel we can do it in the fast lane we have no time people are literally dying from I'm not having the healthcare\nServices that they deserve and that they are entitled to as human beings and as Americans and us Californians on so we don't have time to to move it incrementally we don't have time to make a excuses\nFor the conservatives and the federal government I realize that we do need a waiver from the federal government uh but that should not be an excuse\nFor inaction here I I Believe that we have to take bold progressive\nRadical action right away and not kick the can down the road and that's something that I I tend to do that will be the first issue that I address is bringing forward a single payer Medicare for all system because are for profit health care system is not working and we have\nUh the the resources in California to be able to provide every single Californian I'm with health care uh with health care services and really the money that we save\nFrom the bureaucracy or the money that we would say from that would be able would in in enable us to provide healthcare for every single California right now\nWe're ... we're above your workers on because you don't figure can move that fast obviously why\nWell so I worked on the ... when I worked for president by my work on health care um I wholeheartedly support a single payer system I wholeheartedly support and Medicare for all system frankly my hope is that there will be done and uh it should be done and the federal government but obviously with the current administration is not going to be I think California can and should lead the way on that\nUm I think we have to have a plan to do that and so here's what I Would do first and foremost\nWe need to protect what we currently have right so as as the Trump Administration is trying to dismantle the CIA we should pass an individual mandate here we should make sure that we fix our reimbursement rates which is a big challenge here in California we should make sure we have our we ensure our um our immigrant communities and many of whom are are\nAre undocumented in their living on the brink and they need those resources but the truth of the matter is the single parent we will need a ... a waiver from the federal government to the tune of two hundred billion dollars to make it work\nDonald Trump is not going to give us that waiver so what do we do between now and at twenty twenty when we have president calmly Harris or president lived with Lauren or someone better that we can work with let's set our system up so that we can have a real conversation when we have\nA democratic administration we can work with I advocate for putting a public option on the exchange in the meantime that will help stabilize our exchange make sure I'm it's healthy for the speech um uh and and get us to the point that once we do have a federal\nUm administration that we can work with we can then enacted single payer system so\nFor me it's not a matter of do I support or not I do but we have to have a realistic plan about how we get there and we need to be able to work with a you know our next governor Gavin Newsom as a very um I'm a similar approach to this is I Do I Believe that we can do it I Believe that we should do it and I believe that we will do it and we just have to set a certain amount of things in place first\nTalking later Canada's researcher certainly district Fifteen Giovanna Quebec holes and Buffy works and we're going to cover as many issues as we can possibly coming up on a break quick response from use your bunker vocals\n... yes I I think that you know my opponent again you know you mentioned how you know there are things that we are in uh we share in common but this is the one thing that really is a a major difference although although my opponent talks about\nA a a believing that you know we can have a single payer system you know we always have to follow the money and and and in this race and in many races we have to follow the money and my opponent donors are the ones that are telling her she has a slow it down a and Venus and we're talking about\nPACs PACs led by Ashley Titus who's you know the treasurer of one of the pack the of the California Medical Association and the California dental association these are the folks who are opposing her these are the ones who are doing everything they can possibly do to stop us from getting a Medicare for us\nIt would come up on a regular Buffy ... her\nShirt so I'm I'm happy to chat about the resources that have gone into both sides of the campaign um and and we can have a more robust conversation that we do need I think campaign finance reform these independents interview both are very modern finance reform on really um but the vast majority my donations have come from individual folks um across this district and across the\nState should have some of these folks are not going to help you streamline toward single\nFor I think I should be judged on my twenty or track record working and progressive politics working alongside President Obama to help pass the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd when we leave it there because we're at the British are heading right our listeners when we return this was for a Michael Crichton\nShe lives destroying our democracy for more election coverage on to check out the ... election twenty Eighteen voter guide visit ... dot org slash elections and for the latest updates on our programs and guess find us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter We're at ... for\nThe reason why I can do that and take that stance on is because I'm not swayed by a by a billionaire donors who don't want a moratorium on charters want to privatize our education our education or public education system right now or is being defunded\nAnd that that money is is being\nA transfer to you know to the terrorists to the charter schools and I would\nChallenge you know my support or to have to also um you know very much supporter I'm a pardon me my opponent rather I Would I Would challenge her\nUm ... you know to denounce these these are billionaires who are donating to her to these ... these through I ease rather\nUm and and you know call for a moratorium on charter school um but I Know that it's very difficult and that's why I\nDon't if if they don't invest in a candidate like me they don't invest in the Kennedy like me because I Would immediately denounce or that any kind of support and so when you have ... that are funded by billionaires or donating hundreds of thousands of dollars\nYou know they they they know what they're buying and and so\nYou're pretty she's getting about a hundred and Nineteen thousand for ... and you're getting about a hundred and three thousand\nYeah the I ... that are that are set up by from what I understand um are unions and and unions are working Peter getting support though not let that the I eat we're talking about the I eat right I was talking about right now we're talking about the ... but you go to an end\nSponsorship of the cake you read the lives dream bike city from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with extended beyond demand\nThe billionaires who want to privatize our education\nRight not the same billionaires who wanna destroy unions\nAre not the not the billionaires who want to uh build more a private prisons and ah so I Am a I'm an avid supporter of our public school system I believe we have to fully fund them uh I I Am endorsed by the teachers' unions educators\nAnd faculty association because they know that I Will stand up to to to these entities who wanna destroy our public school system\nSo forgive me I Want to get to sort of our callers and listeners because they're very much want to be a part of this ... ... ... works are here in Studio ... those are contending for district Fifteen there the candidates and\nThey represent very different points of view in many respects but as I said the ... he was ... or political reporter they're on board on many things as well as some of it is a this was backing them and a lot of it as you hear is also what kind of speed a ought to be moved\nHere is more who asked about making sure people were working forty hours a week make enough to afford living in the bay area companies are not willing to pay employees drug and go you first\nRight that's that's one of the problems is is a a ... is is not in people's pay a is not keeping up with the with increases increases are in in uh in everything food rent\nA that's just not happening and and and and you'll see on my platform I talk about the fact that we in California the fifth largest economy in the world\nAre we can't afford to pay our workers what they deserve a we can't afford to have a living wage I advocate for increasing our minimum wage but eventually we have to uh to to talk about and move toward are paying people a living wage but I think\nThis is a huge issue you know we have the highest poverty rate in California in any other state when you take into account cost of living it's about forty percent\nWe see income inequality we've had in Alameda County a forty percent increase in homelessness in the last two years so we're we're seeing the ramifications of of this exact question\nYou know and as someone who I worked against Wal Mart for a couple of years for the in the labor movement for the United states and commercial workers union they weren't tore us for being one of the wealthiest companies in the world and yet not providing good health care and wages for their workers I think we need creative innovative solutions to try to close the wealth gap\nOne of the ideas that I think makes sense and I would introduce legislation\nI'm In Sacramento is to figure out a way to incentivize companies to reduce the pay gap between the highest and play in the lowest paid employee tried to narrow that gap as much as we can\nI also think we have to look at making sure that our folks have I'm I'm a good a job skills training I support for technical vocational programs I'm a product of community college so I Believe there's a lot that can be done to community college level to give folks the skills that they need\nI think we all settled racial orientation yeah more exactly you know I think that's an important element of this also you look at you know the way in which that we shop now how people live you look at Amazon these distribution centers you look at the working conditions at Amazon distribution centers\nTo stuff has to be fixed you know we've got to figure out a way to to reduce the um the wealth gap that exists here but this is all connected to education housing job training all these issues are connected and I think fundamentally you know this is also why twenty eight labor unions have endorsed my campaign um and a lot of our progressive champions like ... and others\nUm cause I think they think I can go to Sacramento and work and into with a diverse coalition folks to actually get stuff done and move the needle on these issues\nAre going to get done the fact that we have a lot of callers who want to talk with both of you and let's hear first from ... through many news we can pure and good morning\nIt's MORNING Hi you're on the air\nGo ahead yeah I Would like to hear but yeah you're on a New Yorker and go ahead I'm Sorry I'm not here what are the candidate where they stand on climate change 'em all these editors who they're going to do that for everybody else get a handle on that I'll take my answer\nYes or no effect for the question and we'll start with a freeway shore so\nThis is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity and I don't mean to be hyperbolic about it but I think that is where we are in times of the essence on this you know I support SP one hundred or support\n'em you know uh doing everything we can to move towards renewable energy reduce fossil fuels this is critical\nYou know send a number of filtering had a bill in the legislature I Believe it died in committee but it's something I think that should come back ending the sale of gasoline cars by twenty forty\nUm those are the things that we need to be doing thirty nine percent of our greenhouse gas comes out of our exhaust by one of our fracking cause me to fracking I support a ban on fracking um I think we ... I I I I uh I support a ban on an ... I I Would I Want to do is absolutely critical to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels\nYou want to move toward that show your credit carbon free um goes we have personally or faster\nFaster I mean I think we've got to go you know this is a very critical issues with it you know there's a lot that goes with that right so for instance that the the assembly member felt things do if we're going to go all electric vehicles right we have to make sure we have the infrastructure for it and we don't have enough\nI'm a places to plug in right now so that all costs resources in time and energy and secondly making sure that are low income communities can participate in that I'm right now electric vehicles are so very expensive so there's a lot I think we have to think through with this but I Do see it as an urgent issue you know and I for me I think about my my daughter's twenty three months\nYou know what's the future she's going to live and um and her children right I think we're in a really critical moment on this\nIssue ... obviously it's a great concern to you where do you see yourself different from what you just heard from this week's um\nWell the difference is the fact that I'm endorsed uh first of all by the Sierra Club a and I'm indoors by every single uh in ...\nUh and I'm indoors by every single or environmental organization in California and the reason for that is that they've seen my track record and my voting record us standing up uh to to major polluters I'm like the fossil fuel industry I think steamy stand up to Chevron\nEnrichment and so so people can trust me to do the very same thing in Sacramento to stand up on behalf of our community and stand up and be half of our planet\nAnd you know where you're going to spend that kind of trust your phone\nI'm saying that you can trust someone who's endorsed by every single environmental organization and yes it's it's ...\nThe the way that you get you when you look when you follow the money you you that's how you can uh determine\nHow a person is going to vote and uh and I'm not I have not\nI'd been endorsed by so many uh one ... all of the environmental organizations in California\nUm because they know that I Will stand up to corporate polluters like I've stood up a Chevron I Will support and they can trust me to support a hundred percent renewables and not to make incremental changes because we don't have time for that the planet is burning and the ... and and the reason when I say when you talk about trust\nIs that I Am running as a candidate who will always in every

regard to environmental issues I think what she was trying to say that somehow I'm you know by painted by the oil and gas industry\nThat is categorically false trying to be very clear about that I've never taken any oil and gas money I've never taken any money that has ... and it would have any negative impact on the environment so I just want to make sure we just clear the record there on that\nUm with regard to the budget you know the the the challenge with the budget in California it's very volatile it's very much tied to personal income right\nI take you read the San Francisco and

purged from Georgia's voter rolls and all of them a hundred and seven thousand\nWere removed because they did not vote in previous elections which falls in line with George's use it or lose a policy that's according to a recent investigation from eight PM reports this news comes on the heels of a recent Pew report which found that fifty three thousand voters have been purged from the rolls in Georgia\nWith blacks who make up thirty two percent of the state's population accounting for Seventy percent of remove voters\nStrict voter id requirements and voter roll purges are on the rise across the country hindering if not slightly denying people ability to vote according to scholar and author Carol Anderson it's because you know the right to vote is under siege in the United states [noise]\nCarolina says a professor of African American studies at Emory University and she joins us from the baby in Atlanta to talk about her new book one person no vote a voter suppression is destroying our democracy and we're going to talk about the history of voter suppression welcome Carolyn Anderson\nThank you so much for having me Michael\nGood to have you and your book is really quite an eye opener and a real revolution a and I wanted to actually before we even talk about voter suppression or Georgia or the last election\nTo talk with you about some of the historical material that you focus on because you write about the Mississippi Plan and we'll talk about that and poll taxes and literacy tests and all the rest of that but\nThat one of the the statistics are just a really hit me square between the eyes was a big with inferior schools and a\nVery er funding really and Jim cook she's the Jim Crow and and white supremacy\nBy the Nineteen forties only three percent of age eligible blacks in the entire south were registered to vote and that's you know extraordinary number to grapple with\nYes yes and and that is the power of this ranch Heisman and remember that all of that happened to get to three percent and an area of the country where the majority of African Americans lift\nAnd the poll taxing the literacy tests that helped make that happen we're both ruled constitutional by the U.S Supreme Court\nSo although we have a Fifteen minute so that's why I started with the history because although we have a Fifteen minute that says your right to vote the right to vote shall not be abridged on account of race color or previous condition of servitude\nThe Mississippi Plan was able to reduce the black voter registration numbers down to three percent\nI also saw data that showed um that um when those were formerly incarcerated get their voting rights back you got about a twenty percent voter turnout rate I started running those numbers and\nI'm Hillary Clinton lost Florida by a little over a hundred thousand votes if felony disenfranchisement\nHad 'em if those who had had a felony had actually been re and franchised what we would have seen is that she would have picked up over two hundred thousand additional vote and she would have won Florida\nTalking with Caroline under since she's the author of one person no vote and she's also Charles how are channeled professor of African American studies\nAt Emory University and you were talking about ID cards before and you do get this argument or want to go to that just for a moment with you um you know what's the big deal you you need a driver's license to drive a car library card like you said it seems ...\nReasonable and legitimate to ask what's the big deal until I guess you look at it as you point out in the book examples like North Carolina for ones from you know gosh that for us\n[laughter] wow I'm so in North Carolina what happened was the state legislature Republican dominated state legislature um the moment that the Republicans came to power in North Carolina they immediately asked for data I'm voting data by race\nAnd they looked and one of the things that they were looking for was the types of IDs that African Americans had and did not have 'em and disproportionately they found that African Americans did not have a driver's license and that's actually quite logical\nUm because owning a car is really a class based thing a cars are expensive and you got the notes you've got gas you've got maintenance you got insurance cars are expensive so if you don't have to have a car then you probably don't have to have a you'd probably don't need a driver's license I mean that's the\nThe kind of thinking behind it so they're they saw that massive discrepancy\nAnd then made basically the the driver's license the holy grail for being able to to access the ballot box and so here you have a state legislature\nNot thinking about how do we ensure democracy how do we ensure that American citizens can vote but instead looking at racial data to figure out just the way they did in Mississippi in Nineteen Ninety how do we keep black folk\nVoting measure current nowadays I mean historically we were talking about a and I'm interested in in your in your thoughts about how voter fraud is played into this whole ... equation because it's very significant and central it a centrally well the Trump administration's we know um did an investigation was led by uh\nUh my parents vice president as well as um um Kansas a representative and they were looking at the fraud and you bring out in your book the fact that uh [noise]\nI'm just I Love to do is California law professor I Believe he's at Loyola in Southern California did a whole study of voter fraud and came to inclusions that there were about thirty one kid cases thirty one cases billions\nAnd yesterday G. H. D. but you know you're you're ... ... it's a compelling argument that this idea of voter fraud is simply a way of saying we need to watch out for and therefore suppress ultimately voters especially voters who are you putting out black Latino Asian um\nBut for that matter a poor or a millennial and young\nAnd that's been pretty consistent since uh the bomber ...\nAbsolutely consistent and so one we have to understand that as you said voter fraud um is really not legit thirty one out of a billion cases and even when the proponents of voter fraud voter fraud voter fraud\nHalf to prevent hardcore evidence in a court of law I'm the way Kris Kobach outta Kansas had to or the way the Greg Abbott out of Texas had to um they could not they simply could not have to find the evidence of that massive rant that voter fraud and they didn't that language of voter fraud\nThat becomes their foundation for saying we need a voter id in order to make sure that only those who are supposed to be voting are voting and so so the basis false\nUm and then the requirement for the id then becomes it it it's based on um the the requirement for an ID then becomes you're looking at something else this isn't about voter fraud um this is about how do we suppressed black voters\nI Want to talk about that more specifically with something we actually talked about on for them and that is what's going on in Georgia now and uh [noise] you know go to Brian Kemp who is the secretary of state Republican running for governor of Georgia he's in charge of voter registration uh [noise]\nAnd so it seems to be in many people's minds a almost a foregone conclusion that there's going to be interference in reduction of those voters who would be likely to vote against him but how this has done it's done first of all\nThrough as you point out signature match ups in Georgia so that election officials who are doing these handwriting analysis analyses without any training that's just part of the ACLU suit\nOr to do that are given that power to decide if the handwriting matches but I Want you to talk about that but also use it or lose it which has also been brought into the Georgia picture\nRight and and use it or lose it is basically saying if you don't vote consistently then in order for voter roll maintenance again that that clinical logical language voter roll maintenance then you'll be removed off the I'm of the voter rolls\nBut the national voter registration act what's called the motor voter law\nHas language in there that you cannot remove someone simply because they do not vote regularly because the the again using like the um Eighteen Ninety Mississippi plant\nUsing the characteristics of the people um minorities don't vote regularly poor people don't vote regularly and the young don't vote regularly\nSo if you in those groups are also the groups that tend to vote democratic so if you use not voting regularly as your litmus test\nThen what you're doing is knocking out um overwhelmingly\nA democratic voters Brian Kemp\nOr says this is just a smokescreen and you say what to\nGet Brian champ [laughter] so what Brian Kemp says is that um he says we we're not purging his office as well you know where we're not purging people of the list\nUm although they have removed over one million voters um for not voting were removing them from the west because they haven't had regular contact with election officials [noise] but if you don't change your name you're not going to contact the election officials who say hey my name is still the same\nIf you don't move out of your voting jurisdiction you know so you may move houses or you may move a ... to an apartment to a different apartment but you're still in the same voting jurisdiction you're not going to to um you know so if you don't move your not going to say hey I'm Still in my same house [laughter]\nSo so the only way you're not having contact with the election official is by not voting regularly so That's Brian Kemp smoke screen 'em and and so but what's that does then\nBy using not voting it target democratic voters and in a state like Georgia that is thirty two percent African American it targets African American\nAnd this has done a pretty much as I said not just in the south in New Hampshire for example we also had a legislation or the set is the handwriting matching thing and people it's been fairly I think significant we've proven that people who are disabled or elderly that many of us is very have variations in the way we send our names\nI Want to bring our listeners into this and

starts in January to apply visit cake you eating dot org slash jobs and for the latest updates on our programs\nAnd guess find us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter We're at ... for um [noise]\n\nHas serious anxieties about voter suppression and a lack of public confidence in elections is very dangerous for any democracy it's in progress was best interest to assuage these anxiety so do we want to spend our time and energy making ridiculous arguments against voter ideas are helping people get the idea is they need to vote\nAnd so I'm vote riders actually gets people the IDs that they need and they are nationwide and they're doing an amazing job they were there in Alabama early and vote riders work um was essential I'm In that that campaign\nBut what we also have to be very cognizant of it is that we don't give credence to the lie because then that just going to create a\nAnd deeper live that's going to create a bigger in deeper law and so we're always playing defense okay we'll get the idea\nA bigger and deeper law and so we're always playing defense okay we'll get the id will know now now you're going to do because these are so think about in um the recent Supreme Court case in North Dakota\nWhere the Supreme Court ruled that North Dakota's new voter id law which which says you have to have an address [noise]\nUm and many of those who live on the reservation have PO box is and not addresses so it looks like well yeah you just have to have an id but now you have to have an ID I'm with an address and so now there's this mad scramble\nAnd in these cases are always happening I'm just like the Nineteen fifty seven civil rights act these cases are always happening and there's always the next thing and the next thing and the next thing what we really need to have\nIs the kind of for instance the automatic voter registration that Oregon put in place [noise] um and that California put in place that also has pre registration for sixteen or Seventeen year olds who automatically become registered at Eighteen\nThinking through how do we open up the franchise is absolutely essential figuring out how do we move around all of these voter suppression techniques is important for now but that cannot be our foundation\nDo we also need and uh 'cause it's been true in other states are two separate of secretary of state who's running for higher office whether it's governor or other authors from the job of turning two elections which is really their command\nAbsolutely we really do and and I would say that those who have integrity would have recused themselves would have stepped down from that position while running for governor um because right now I mean there was a ... a a report that came out yesterday\nAnd talking about how many in the African American community um question whether this election is going to be valid because campus sitting on top of it and and your your your um listener was absolutely correct\nThe last thing one of the last things you want in a democracy is the questioning of an election whether whether it's a valid or not because that's like our ... our one of our poor pillars that\nCitizens calm if they choose their representatives and then we understand that the majority\nOf those who win the majority of the votes but that's not what's going on with other shows me just easier lot easier just to have an idea that could [laughter] and you're not on the same page on that one uh let me get some callers on who you are going to uh we should join us if you're on the good morning\nMorning um I think we can all agree that um the possibility that they\nKeep a government accountable right so what are we not pushing ahead with poultry thinking what if gerrymandering enact your quality of the popular thing definitely the the the the hiding factor what is it that when we are not on it\nIt can poaching aging at the end how many Facebook catches thank you\n[laughter] okay thank you it always comes up for professor under sooner industrial use uses good examples where it seems to work pretty well compulsory voting where are you\n[noise] I'm thinking about it\nUm and I'm not quite sure where I Am on it yet\nBut I Know that we've got to do something and so that's why I I go I'd definitely go toward the automatic voter registration um the compulsory boating I'm just not sure yet I'm because they're ... and and my not sure yet\nDeals with some of the kind of societal pieces that we have to think through a particularly in the way that this nation is so economically and racially stratified that we have to have mechanisms\nSo that that worked um because what we have right now is like for instance in Georgia Brian Kemp to shut down two hundred and fourteen of the polling places most of those in a minority neighborhoods um and in poor neighborhoods and so if the polling places\nAre removed from those neighborhoods but we have compulsory voting what's usually uses for the uh an extreme variations of how how do you read his excuses for the\nUm his excuses um are the ones that that are normal normally used um poll consolidation for physical reasons why we don't have a lot of voters coming through those polls and so in order to be financially responsible\nYadda yadda yadda but [laughter] you know you're going to Seinfeld or [laughter]\nQuestion from Benjamin why do we need voter registration at all we don't need to register for jury duty or to be recorded for taxes\nAnd\n... and that is a great question and voter registration in fact came about as a disc franchising mechanism um and where we are right now um\nIs that you can see people [noise]\nYou can see the the\nThe thing about being able to say OK I'm here I'm voting but voter the way the voter registration works is just franchising if we had the same day voter registration so when you came to the polls you could register right then right there that would be less just franchising\nOur guest again is Carolyn Anderson and she's professor of African American studies at Emory and ... and I'm\nCalling from Emeryville Kenny that's you good morning you're on the air [noise]\nMorning your question our young kid I was ... my grandmother and that was the thing that we would do and now they're older and I actually more influential and social media how do I get individuals like bowling actually take it seriously\nA vehicle you know that there\nAre getting interested in going on all across the country but my question\nAnd we go to you again professor understand and I think it's\nMy question or we go to you again professor Anderson\nAnd I think is using that incredible platform that you have first getting out the data you know so that was one of the things I I I really stress with my book one person no vote was just getting the evidence because if\nWe say oh voter suppression then the thing kicks back huh yeah yeah yeah you just want everybody to vote to voter fraud\nVoter fraud voter fraud but when you start saying for instance what the voter ID laws in Wisconsin did was that eight percent of whites\n... um did not vote they said because of the voter id law in twenty seven percent of African Americans did not vote because of the voter ID laws\nAnd all of a sudden you begin to see over and over and over the impact that this has and the way that it skews democracy and then you provide information about how to get involved\nUm how to join one of these groups that you know is dealing with um ending gerrymandering how to do joined the groups that are dealing with massive voter registration\nHow to get in with the groups that are providing resources for people to be able to get to the polls\n'em how to be election a poll watchers all of those sorts of things so first do you you lay out the data and the import and the impact of that data and then the available resources because really our democracy is at stake right\nNow it's a question from a listener named summer the bears down on what we're talking about right now she wants to know or their studies or in the accounting on how lower income and people of color field of their vote doesn't matter I very total experience with this especially people who would vote Democratic Party [noise]\nYes we've got so we've got really good data on that and um and particularly for instance on issues of\nUm\nVoter lines so one of the the the one of the key strategies used is to not put enough working machines and minority precincts and enough poll workers and so what should be a quick in and out then becomes you know lines that stretch for two hours three hours\nIn Miami with a line that stretch for seven hours um and what that does because where those precincts are those are working class neighborhood and those are minority neighborhoods\nAnd the data are clear um I think with the U.S civil rights commission did a study I think it would be a civil rights commission did a study on I'm voting lines in the twenty twelve election\nAnd ... and found that in precincts that had Latino and they were overwhelmingly Latino or black the lines were the longest and in neighborhoods where\nThe it was overwhelmingly white the lines were the shortest and\nAnd what we also know is that what those long lines do again there's research on this with those long line to do is that they discourage people from voting again but they're done only discourages them it discourages their network because they're trying I was in that line for eight hours", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city":
