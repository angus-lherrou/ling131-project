as part of our election twenty Eighteen coverage we're going to hear from both sides on proposition ... and the debate and joining us now here in Studio to help flush out what is all about that is what proposition Penn is all about ... the reporter guy mess around guy welcome to morning Michael morning to you will also welcomed Brian Augusta who represents\nThe yes on prop ten campaign and he's director of the California rural legal assistance foundation good to have you Brian and goes to\nThe thank you Michael and also good to have pets able house who else who joins us for the debate or do we have guy flesh things out for his paw and Patsy will house or represents the no on ten campaign he's also executive director of the California counsel for affordable housing that say Los welcome\nThank you very much Michael and now that we're all assembled let me go to guy Maserati and a guy let's talk about what is in this I mean essentially you were talking about local control\nAbsolutely I think that's a really easy a good way to think about this for the vast majority of California cities\nThis is about local control if you don't have the rent control on the books if proposition ten were to pass\nThese cities would suddenly have the power to enact rent control limit rent increases on the local level is something that the state has largely banned for the last few decades\nNow for the Fifteen or so cities that have rent control laws on the book it's not all about look control it's there's actually some things that could happen right away if proposition ten passes you know some laws that have been kind of frozen for decades suddenly rent control ordinance that become active again\nBecause the ... which this would repeal or was passed by one vote back in Nineteen Ninety five but we've had rent control ordinances are which are in effect for example in Berkeley has gone to the trouble of actually putting another proposal in in the event that proposition ten passes\nAbsolutely I think they're Berkeley's kind of far ahead of other bay area cities on this they have a plan in place as you mentioned if prop ... passes\nThey have a measure on their ballot or you know that voters would have to vote separately on locally that kind of maps out a post ... ten\nRent control future for the city basically setting a rent levels right now with a new base line and then easing buildings into rent control that is buildings that would age on their twentieth birthday so to speak with suddenly become eligible for rent control um\nOr and and and that's why or even the public housing authorities association of California are are opposed to prop ten because there's there's no carve out for them\nUh and so we we think are another regulatory a restriction on people that are involved in developing affordable housing or will will serve are no good purpose it's just another layer of monitoring\nRight now the the the five hundred thousand low income housing tax credit units or\nOr or rent restricted by by the federal department of housing and urban development in the treasures office here in the state\nThose projects are monitored ah each and every year to make sure that they're serving people that are that make no more than sixty percent of area median income\nIn and we don't need another uh a regulatory an impediment to be imposed on developers that have a a difficult time now with nimby ism uh in in other opponents of affordable housing at the local jurisdiction\nLet me stay with us for a moment with your pet because uh ... UC Berkeley housing researcher uh did some data got some data on six of various cities and\nUh it turns out that with rent control there is more housing produce per capita a between two thousand seven to ten thousand Thirteen um then without\n\nI I I I I I don't know the statistics are Michael I don't I don't know if that is the case or not I address that she she did a good research on this but he was my understanding that uh\nThat rent control in in local jurisdictions the Fifteen or so that you mentioned earlier on the program\nA causes a people at the at the local level that that have just a single family unit or two that they're renting out or to uh to basically want to take that that unit off the market because they don't they they simply don't want to go through a ... the regulatory process that uh the rent control brings on\nLet me go back to you on this uh buying Augusta because there's a risk or of course as you pointed out of uh making vulnerable families lose their homes or but there's also make people being displaced I mean this is a serious crisis of me and many people's minds be the number one crisis in the state of California but\nIf you if if you have a well rental units taken off the market because uh landlords don't like the fact that there's rent control a and you have perhaps a slowdown in housing construction as we've been talking on the table house it's sort of antithetical to what you hope for isn't it\nWell let's talk about that and I want to address that point if I could quickly go back to a couple of points that pat has made\nNumber one um if you look at who's supporting yes on ten most of the state wider regional affordable housing groups that policy experts have been working on how to solve our affordable housing prices are low income people are supporting prop dad so I Want to make sure that your listeners are clear\nSponsorship of the cake you mean the live stream bite super micro that Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at for Mike Rowe dot com\nDeed restricted affordable units are\nEvery or to California addresses that and that's an issue to be addressed at the local level and they and they have an exemption for the subsidized restriction affordable housing like what\nIs your stabilizes talking about so that's it I Believe that's a non issue with respect to prop tend 'em with respect to the production of affordable housing and housing overall you a reference to study earlier and it it does it confirms that I'm In the\nThree largest bay area cities with rent control San Francisco San jose in Oakland\nWho only have twenty percent of the regents housing in that time period between\nA two thousand and one eight Seventeen forty three percent\nThey built forty three percent of the new unit so they're producing affordable housing West Hollywood which has rent control has met every portion of it state mandated um housing production goals so\nRent control is not an impediment to the production of housing and it's not an impediment to the production of affordable housing\n[noise] um add to this question of um\n[noise] what does it do to sort of housing picture in a city um we know that when in cities average control it helps keep rents alone not obviously just for those folks who live in a rent controlled unit but it also helps keep prices low overall in the market several studies have have demonstrated that as well\nWhat would you say a pet saying well how about a little if proposition ten is not the answer to fix the housing shortage what is\nWe we think that uh in in in ... we're putting our efforts into supporting a proposition one to four billion dollar bond issue in a proposition too which is the two billion dollar bond issue for for homelessness we think\nThat's where our efforts should should be going if a if we're going to ... if we're going to deal with with what we we think and what the economists think is a is a supply problem or in terms of what the um\nIt was just said about um uh Brian just said about the uh the production of affordable housing in places like Berkeley or or West Hollywood\nA ... yes that that may very well be the case because if affordable housing is Brian said is is carved out from the rent control initiative at the local level than than it's not going to be an impediment to to produce affordable housing in in those is a\nA rent controlled cities but but it could be in in in other arenas or if you're if you're talking about mixed income housing that the California housing Finance Agency\nIs is advocating a in a big way in terms of how they're going to use a\nSenate bill to a set of Dr Atkins bill that it's a real estate tax that will produce a about two hundred and fifty million ah this this uh this first year in twenty Nineteen uh in in California housing Finance Agency is using a share of that money\nTo support the development of a of mixed income housing which uh consist of a of a number of units that will be serving people with fifty and sixty percent of of area median income\nAnd then a another subset that will be serving people between eighty percent in a hundred and twenty percent\nOf median income and then there will be some twenty percent of the units that would be serving a market rate or a a tenant's um in that we think that that is a better solution to the problem a than a\nThan rent control because we think mixed income or a developments basically work because you have the the higher income people in the market rate units that are helping to subsidize people\nThat that are in the the more a red restricted units up to a hundred and twenty percent of median than we think that that is a a a a better solution to this problem than uh than than than rent control\nCan I ask everything else about that though I Know because because you're you're as I said a on a California executive director of California constantly for double housing [noise]\nUh I think you noted that uh the governor and the legislature and essentially did away with a redevelopment agencies and twenty four teams would you like to see redevelopment agency and what it used to do come back into California\nWe we we absolutely woods or were very supportive of of what a civil even chew has talked about doing in the coming year uh this is one the point where Brian Augusta and I will be back together or in the legislature are advocating for uh\nFor the renewal of a of a more limited kind of redevelopment let me ask a quick\nQuestion because we're coming up on her break ... and ... and let me in fact the phone number I Know a lot of people are going to want to weigh in here we do want to hear from you and you can join us now that are toll free number the number to call\nThis eight six six seven three three six seven eight six and you can\nLet your voice be hurt by dialing and now it

Oregon or go to our website take you eat out orange slice forum click on a segment or tweet us at Twitter handle is ... Brian is just going to ask you quickly you know economists across the board say rankles troll doesn't work are they wrong\n[noise] well this may andme about economists don't rent control derives largely from a survey that was ... years and years ago and really\nNothing more recent uh analysis on the stand for it to the sense they said the same thing\nAfter the break maybe we could come back to that because I Want to just quickly make the point a there is some flaws in the Stanford steady but it does indicate that it also helps\nAre there some flaws at the Stanford study but it does indicate that it also helps support stability for rent controlled tennis and that's been glossed over\nYellow haven't gone back because we are coming up in a bragging we've got lots of people who want to join in here and we're going to hear more from them as a writer who's here with us in Studio as well as Brian Augusta\nWho is legislative advocate for the California rural legal assistance foundation representing yes on ten and we also have pet Sable house on the line executive director of the California counsel for affordable\nHousing representing no on ten you can indeed have your own opinion heard here or raise any questions you might have you're listening forum on ... public radio on Michael Krasny\n\nYou're listening to the rebroadcast of this morning's foreign program and it

eighty\nWhich is to keep in mind that when prop ... passes if the voters passed prop to end\nAll it does is restore the authority to local voters and local governments to consider additional policies records from a policy that they don't currently have\nBut before the real estate industry pass the costs of Hawkins act and limited a local discretion around us issue we know what locals voters did\n... voters in every jurisdiction to California for example with no a direction from the state legislature enacted rent control policies that exempted new construction\nMany of them adopted policies that provide an exemption for owner occupied housing or for certain forms of single family housing and there's a split among this issue of vacancy control Saddam had vacancy controls some did not so there's really no reason to assume that if we put\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite super micro that Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at for Mike Rowe dot com\nWhat we'll do is give a lot more flexibility for cities to consider their particular needs\nWhat is the housing stock in that particular city and how should we apply it if we decided to adopt their rent control policy is there are some hybrid version of vacancy control that would be a ... that works better in our city\nRight now they're handcuffed they can't make those decisions because the state has for has intervened for decades and tell them they can and now it's time to give that piece back\nTo local decision makers to make decisions in this housing crisis that are tied to what is happening in their city\nI Want to bring more colors aboard we go next to Stephanie in Santa Rosa good morning\nIn my in my life and I just I don't think about retirement and I guess by the time I found out and find her credit carpet ranking out\nBy my story high in fat ranked cutting Hi I'm not going to make a profit on Iran I can build equity um ... later\nHow I went right will throw a fat pay rent it made my right at that I don't quite a lot like I Want my wagon again\nTo direct question you want to answer that sure I mean I should say Santa Rosa there's then local efforts to put in place rent control and the local level in recent years that have failed so you know in in your case specifically Santa Rosa has no rent control law\nI'm On the books you know the the council or you know and our mission if could make that happen in the future but you know once this election is certified hypothetically if proposition tend were to pass nothing will change immediately in Santa Rosa\nLet me thank you for the call Catherine and we'll go right to an assassin excuse me who write to another caller and that's Eric Harris joined us\nI think you are ah my name's Derek and um you know I call it a a um a\nJust a ... well how common to put out the um the hypocrisy um that I feel is being set forth by the opposing prop ... side a and it echoes what we just heard from Brian ... and that is that you know the idea is to our local governments\nTo make decisions all Republican legislature signed by Pete David put into place called ... which is so contrary to what they normally preach the idea that like local government is going to be the head of the state uh making decisions and always thinking they're doing ... Penn\nIs to allow local governments to make the decision and that the populations in the government don't like it they of course can make changes to their local government and make changes to the fishing so it's really a\nWhat often is there a concern of idea which is to not have government overriding over large overriding the decision of local government and I think that there was a lot of misinformation about that um I think that's kind of declaring that people ...\nLet me thank you for the call and go right to say well what would you say they're sorry among pat\nI'm I Am I Am sympathetic to ah to what you're saying about about local control it except to the fact that the local governments are throughout California in many instances that have not function effectively with regard to dealing with this\nThis shortage of of a multi family housing specifically\nUm you you you look at the he talked about state laws being imposed upon local jurisdictions in in in some cases that was that was a central because local governments wouldn't wouldn't take\nIt deal with the problem at hand ah in in one of good a good example of that is when the housing element law of the general plan was [noise] was passed us some twenty five\nYears ago that he did impose upon local government ... the requirement that they had to to to determine what kind of housing needs they were facing and they're Jewish addiction and then they had to lay out a plan and find a enough sites are properly zoomed in order to be able to have developers come in\nAnd it developed both single family and multi family housing and in many instances even today you have local jurisdictions that are that are not complying with the uh the housing element a\nRequirement of their or their local a local a general plans or they're just not doing the job so uh in in some instances local control or works very well known and other instances are you you have to have the state stepped in\nAnd and and require demand local governments do their fair share of of the of making housing available in their jurisdiction as opposed to passing it on to the to the jurisdiction next door\nLet me think here for the call on them as a running was\nYeah it was just going to say it's it's it's a pendulum you know the ... the for years you know the state\nUh you know in recent years the state legislature has concluded that local governments have not done enough to support the construction of of housing so they've stripped tower from local governments now we see you know a rental advocates saying the state government has not done enough to address rental issues that they're seeking to get power back to the local level\nSo I you know I Do think this is a pendulum has swung back and forth over time\nAnd we're going to go to more calls for a couple of tweets though and guy let me go to you and these are listening to which is the argument is that rent control is to provide immediate relief to the housing crisis and why not place a time limit on it\nAnd I think you're going to see some cities are likely do that you know I think you could use may introduce we already see Berkeley doing this the kind of a time limit that says you know new can we don't want to discourage\nImmediate development we don't want to scare away developer so we're going to put a time limit to say maybe a buildings cannot be rent controlled for their first Fifteen year for the first twenty year for the first Thirty years to try to give developers a you know to not give them a way to say you're going to have an ability to make back\nProfits within the first couple of decades\nAnd Scott wants to do with probably ten prevent the state from ...\nWithin the first couple of decades\nAnd Scott wants to do with probably ten prevent the state from ever again enacting laws related to rent control without for seeking voter approval\nI mean yeah I think by by doing this as as a proposition there would be a you know certain elements would need to have to go back and forth voters but what this is really doing is taking out a a an existing legislative statute\nAnd if you want to weigh in here by the way a there is a line of animal eight six six seven three three six seven eight six or email us for on the cake you eat at Oregon here's gate gate you're on the air\n[noise] and I grew up in the bay area here and\nThinking about leaving the area maybe in the state because I Can't afford the rent here in on their I'm strongly in favor of ten I'm from yeah comes down to you\nChris interest should we be protecting the winters and people who are just trying to have some stability or is it people who are uh really landlords I agree that they should be able to make a share trend but that's already protected by law\nWell does it come down to that new judgments ... most ready I mean to you for the tendency for the landlord law I think even more specific way she may in fact I was just looking at some numbers just with sixty percent right here in San Francisco or living in rent control\nI mean right and I think even more specifically when we talked about rent control is really for current renters there's the you know the research has been done that says you know if you\nAre passed rent control your possibly preventing future renters from having an affordable housing stock at the rental level but who you're really helping or people in homes you know currently um who who are at risk of being priced out things about seniors on fixed income\nUm people who were really close to being kind of on the edge when it comes to housing that to rent control would help you know right away if prop tempered a pass in many jurisdictions um and then in others you know you'd have to wait for a local action\nTo actually over sixty percent by the way I think that uh let me think the caller and move on to more calls actually move on to a comment first\nTime since I Lived in Berkeley for Eighteen years old I benefited from rent control but it doesn't really work except for people who are already entrenched in their apartments if you're in a rent controlled rumor apartment you'd never leave the kind of people who benefits a mostly white collar professions who can pay for their own home repair\nYeah I think that's a you know a fair criticism because there's no means testing for rent control right like you you uh if you're in a rent controlled apartment I'm you may not necessarily be low income and there is no incentive to leave\n'em you know that works for people who are you know like I said maybe on a fixed income but again if you're let's say you're a single senior living in a three bedroom apartment you may not need a three bedroom apartment but you're certainly not going to go out in the market to try to find a studio\nHere is Mark Mark thinks they're waiting you're on the air\nHello oh I'm Sorry Jeff and Jeff go ahead you're on the air\nOh hey I object to strip the guy and

this is the second in a series of reports that we put forward looking at the question of tea and seeds in San Francisco\nLast summer we put out a report called TSE today and the motivation for that was because a lot of people said hey there seem to be a lot of tea and he's on the street today but we had no data that although\nThe ... last ask you a TNT as\nI should I'm Sorry I Can't see strand for transportation network company and that's the kind of legal term for ... left and other companies as well and so again there was this perception that they were a lot of these New Britain vehicles out of the street but nobody knew how many ah\nDo report to the California public utilities commission which regulates them but the the PUC wouldn't share it with house we were able to get some data by keeping with some researchers Northeastern University\nAnd what our study revealed was that there are a lot of these great lift trips happening in San Francisco they were mostly happening in the most congested parts of the city and many of those trips were happening at the most congested times of day\nScooter over here from sixteenth street part I was really glad to find went out there because it allowed me to get here on time but um\nNo so ... Oprah and left have a couple of big a push facts here I mean you know what they you know they feel like the methodology is flawed and they um point to two big factors one is the study doesn't\nExplicitly account for the impact of tourism\nUm it it turns out that if you poke into ... and tourism is up phenomenally over the last uh you know several years going back to twenty tennis up something like thirty seven percent\nSo we've got about twenty five million people coming into the city every year uh for quote unquote tourists purposes so those are convention goers in conference goers in and people just coming in for the day\nBut I'm the statistics from the the tourists folks show that most of the people still seem to be taking transit were walking to their to their destination and you would that's not entirely surprising for conference goers for instance\nUm the other thing that has happened on the street is that we have new delivery services right there are\nUm meal delivery and package delivery services and then there's an increase in e commerce that uh has caused a lots more vehicles to be on the street we think but you know common sense would suggest and and actually I'm just quoting the transportation authority and this\nThat probably a lot of those deliveries are just replacing trips that might have happened anyway\nSo in terms of that kind of methodology those claims about poor methodology is it's really hard to see how they'll stand up now the thing that uh Joe mentioned that's that bears repeating has all this data that they used is actually been publicly a relief sits there are links on the transportation authority website\nAnd they've invited people to uh to to crunch the numbers themselves look at the methodology and come to their own conclusions about um about where it might be improved well let me invite\nOur listeners to join us on this I Know some of you may indeed want to respond to the reports it was put up by the transportation authority what do you think the effect is a mover and lift to these rights services uh in terms of your own problems with traffic congestion and you can join us now that are toll free number let me invite you to\nDo that that number is eight six six seven three three six seven eight six we welcome your calls so feel free to be part of the program again the number to call eight six six seven three three six seven eight six you can also of course joined us by email forum I take the dot org or go to our website Kiki B.D dot org slash forum and click on this segment or\nTweet us our Twitter handle is at Kiki weedy forum and\nHere's a comment from ... race in my opinion listen to him or not the major offenders here with few exceptions these companies\nDrivers pick up their passengers and hustle off to their destinations without snarling traffic they don't normally double park for Fifteen minutes at a time or wander around looking for a place to park the text buses or a bigger problem because of their size the increase in population and decrease in parking spaces are the root of the problem\nSo we'll hear from some more of you our listeners but first I Want to actually because we promise that we would cover a another important reports it came out in this report that came out\nA that says it's Seventy one percent of the streets of San Francisco Oakland a nearby cities are dilapidated in San jose is not far behind in sixty nine percent of the big emphasis has this report is that\nUm that essentially the streets are in serious problem and the terrible repair and uh\nThe streets were in a serious problem and the terrible repair it and uh that brings us to the gas tax than directly I mean you have to wonder about the timing of this I Do I must confess\nWell I mean if you read the report that was put out by disorganization trip in ... I'm\nUsed to stand for the road improvement program it's a sort of an industry Reuben who's a construction firms are engineering firms labor unions in the insurance companies\nAnd the like and I'm you know they've been putting out this report and it's based on government data or what what the state's report to the federal government and if you read the report um there is a pitch in the California versions of the report for\nFor sb one for I'm Sorry for the the increase gasoline tax that that is part of the solution to improving these roads but to back up just a little bit yes these reports have showed\nUm bay area rows and rows and other parts of California it'd be pretty rough shape for a long time um\nYou know the the share of roads that are said to be in poor condition and that's based on the\nSomething called the international roughness index um I just love that term but I'm the their share that are in poor condition it's Seventy one percent or sixty four percent in San jose in fifty seven percent in Los Angeles and then there are lots of other places\nOr nearby that show up here like smaller cities Antioch in Concord all both have more than fifty percent of the roads\nAnd then as you I mean we're talking about to the to the motorists who are listening to this or in their cars and ... over a thousand dollars a year in terms of what\nThey say that the increase costs from from everything repairs or reduce gas mileage um delay all that you know a total together is more than a thousand dollars\nAnd they're also saying the costs are going up because since the you've got all this pavement deterioration costs go up when that happens in terms of fixing and maintaining and the cost of repairing a car never goes down [laughter]\nAh there's a an extreme to live by well we're going to go to your calls and emails and you can join us on this report as well which was also released by the barrier Metropolitan Transportation committee and are\nInterested in again the timing of this report or they won't let me just interject something there the Metropolitan Transportation commission actually released a different report which also looked at pavement conditions\nAnd they noted that they do telling industries for welders\nSimilar similar and and what that report shows you that gives the score for pavement in the region and it's not a good score a doesn't really mean anything by itself but say sixty seven\nAnd what they pointed out is that still make it worse of the nation [laughter] yeah it's it's bad but the uh what they point out is that over the last Fifteen Years\nUm it's risen four points from I think sixty three and needs to get to eighty five to be good and so at that rate or will it will be the end of the twenty first century before we see good roads in the bay area\nUnless we do something well here's Ronald says just want to point out the congestion cities is not new in New York City after World War two there was a huge amount of traffic caused by unlimited numbers of taxi cabs taxi medallions system was set up in response to this problem um\nWe talk about tax season is a whole picture that we're giving you about these two forces let's find out what our listeners want to say are asked in Susan we begin with you good morning\nI felt that Iraq and government report [noise] how about that from some from China parents go\nIf drivers are people like ally professional driver\nI lift driver show more weight walk intersection never pull over\nHere by in large really really hard and I understand that but if I drive a lot of drivers giant and block section and blocked driveway blocked by what the heck it and I would say\nWell we mentioned taxis before I ask them play more about this than anybody in terms of interfering with their traffic or let me go to you understand well I I guess I Would say that's a\nPretty a common complaint about uh the ride service drivers or I Would say that there's probably a lot of individual variation I'm speaking as a a a former taxi driver who always had a absolutely pristine approach to uh to driving but I mean yes you do see\nYou do see some of the things you mention almost every day the San Francisco police and other I'm a city agencies have recognized they've heard complaints they recognize the problem\nTo some extent there been some enforcement efforts in in high traffic orders like Valencia street where there have been lots of tickets written but I'm the volume of cars out there I mean we're talking about uh at the end of twenty sixteen the estimate was that these cars are making\nNow this is who bring lift cars were making a hundred and Seventy thousand\nA trips a day in San Francisco and um that's out of ... a slightly more than a million total for all cars so fight it cars are still the number one source of traffic in the city but that that's how much they were contributing then so you you know you're gonna see problems with that\nAnd we're going to continue taking your calls and having a you involved in this conversation again we're talking with them directly here in Studio\nTransportation editor in Puerto Rico reading news in pristine driver I just found out that the labels that you carry with you as well and joke that's the only is a deputy director for technology dated analysis with the San Francisco county transportation authority and author of the report finding companies lay over lifted caused increase congestion\nMore had say two on Michael Krasny [noise]\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro that Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com [noise]\nI think there are a lot of questions about I listen we let me back up just a minute so I think one reaction to the report honestly and you get to some comments I've seen in social media is old room left for making congestion worse da\n... I think there's been a widespread understanding\nIn part because his Joe mentioned there was a pretty comprehensive report that the transportation authority put out last year about the volume of of a ride service traffic but\nI I think most of the reaction is is is curiosity and in terms of um what needs to be done and this gets to what the companies\nNeed to do I mean this ... in a sense is really all about data it's been very hard for city officials anywhere in California to find\nOut exactly what the companies are doing in their own jurisdictions because the state the California public utilities commission regulates these companies in cities can't so\nI'm One hope is that when this per ride\nTax goes into effect which would be in twenty twenty\nAfter a vote in twenty Nineteen of all that happens then the companies would be operating on a basis where they would need\nTo provide a very detailed or at least much more detailed information about what they're doing so I think there's a what was expressed the other day or in the board meeting was a real hunger for that to happen\nDay or in the board meeting was a real hunger for that to happen sooner rather than later and then as I said I'm maybe consideration of some stronger steps to to limit traffic activity in the most crowded parts of the city so that's\nA south of markets the financial district and then district five supervisor district five which stretches from\nThe civic center area out through a haze valley to um\nTo the panhandle area so those are some of the things that folks\nWere saying how much of a difference these tax you makes you think\nWell you know the the funds from the taxes are supposed to go to ... transportation projects a San Francisco has a tremendous like almost every jurisdiction has a tremendous unfunded transportation need is something like\nAnd I'm [laughter] it's it sounds fantastic but twenty two billion dollars over the next Thirty years say and I'm so this will help in funding but of course it's not the the complete solution there you know we're going to see more requests\nIn the form of votes on taxes for transportation funding infrastructure funding in the years ahead yeah do you want to add something here\nWell I just wanted to say that one of the you know this report is silent in terms of making specific policy\nPrescriptions recommendations but I'm providing that kind of policy advisory role is something that the transportation authority does and we will be supporting our board as they are evaluated look at the options around the attacks\nUh you know I I think there's Dan mentioned earlier next week we're going to be going back to our board again to talk about some of these options are with respect to congestion management well we have been looking at some pricing strategies a specifically around Treasure Island a freeway corridors\nHow but at this point there's an active we're looking at a kind of downtown gesture that's something that a court board for direct shot\nAnd then again joke instantly own is deputy director for technology a data and analysis with the San Francisco county transportation authority and get some more callers on let's go to you he thinks we're waiting joins\n[noise] hey my question why are they in fact I got so bad that chronicled we had an article where he spent for much repair and Katie\nAnd I don't get to New York it's five times spending for much by the way I guess got back from New York and she really our find air [noise]\nOf course much harsher weather can deal with the free on ... and all that stuff I I don't understand [noise]\nThat helped me some light here did back in you know I'm not familiar with the statistics that you're you're citing I'm I'm going to go and read that as soon as we're off the air but\nUm you know there as we've been saying there's been sort of a chronic ... well we mentioned this other report about pavement conditions\nAnd one thing I Will note is that the number of\nPoor roads in the bay area is said to be Seventy one percent that number really hasn't changed in recent years a couple of years ago last time this report came out it was about the same and it's always been\nA pretty high there's been some movement in in other places Los Angeles um\nThings have actually gotten a little better Los Angeles used to have the worst road there there are a percentage of poor roads has gone down\nI mean what you say about weather and everything is is absolutely true I mean it would seem like we've got ... except for the winter rains I mean uh you know we've got pretty good climate conditions to hold on to keep pavement\nA whole but you know there are other factors just like the volume of traffic that uh that they do tear it apart I and so I'm Sorry I Can't really give you\nA satisfactory answer about the why uh people have noted though I'll say this one last thing that lots of construction projects especially transportation construction projects\nReally do cost a lot in California and they pointed to things like\nYou know our environmental laws and other kinds of in a you know ah ah administrative review that slow things down and make them a more expensive um that certainly not a complete answer but it may be a part of what's going on\nIs that in is ever going to be [laughter] nothing under ...\nThese things will be will be finished I mean it takes a really long time uh for some of this stuff to to happen and and that's a big complaint people have why does it take so long you know in Oakland east Oakland\nUh AC Transit is in the middle of a really long a project it's similar to van ness they're turning it into a bus rapid transit route essentially\nAnd you know is taking years and years for them to complete and\nYou know in the meantime people in the neighborhood and people who have to drive through at or near it are are really impacted for a long time\nThere was an article in the chronicle about how the impact affected small business people in Venice\nYeah and and uh folks out on a jury where this is going to happen are are are fearful of the same thing I mean the promises that when\nYou know when the projects are done as long as they take they will really make things better and they will make travel faster especially for those who are using a transit and San Francisco does have a transit first policy in terms of its transportation a development\nLet me go to more of your calls let me bring along in next to London joined us\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at him for Mike Rowe dot com\nRead people put forward to vote for that is the bad roads and I'm Wondering how much of that gas tax actually goes to local roads\nYou know I Can't give you a percentage but I'm the what this tax was designed to do is going to be in force or is designed to be enforced for ten years it's going to raise\nYou know a pox and begin to be done but there is a debate on that too we featured dinner election coverage is in our archives and you can go right to it\n[laughter] oh yeah and and so the it's designed to raise about fifty billion dollars\nAnd the bulk of that money is to go for larger you know inner city roads or you know bridge projects there are some local streets in it but the bulk of the money is is really going to a major arteries and in highways and a lot of that work has already started but um\nYou know ... we're in a situation is I was saying before where there is a continuing unfunded needs for local roads and we all\nYou know if you drive and specially but even if you ride the ... the bus I mean you know places or bicycle especially you know places where\nThe the pavement is rotten and it stays rotten for a long time with that with maybe just a band aid kind of fix and um you know the gas tax by itself unfortunately is not going to\nA fix all of that here is Chris Chris you're on good morning Chris how are you there\nI Am Michael packed two quick\nComments if you've got to London of comparison I don't know who's fixing our roads were the quality pavement as a real question and how those contracts are dark gun unrelated to suffer market [noise]\nI think one of the biggest issues is one hundred percent Twitter were able to come down with the help of at least the change the payroll tax to bring a climate that part of the city public transportation never caught up in your body left is really the only way to get there so I'll take my comment off the air\nI think he will come and do you want to come in and the joke\nYou know ... yeah I I just wanted to wait a little bit it's anticipated that of the sixty million\nA mad extra slow and highway thirty seven westbound out of all a oh toward Sears point because of the earlier problem with the railroad arms near one Twenty one

D public radio the time is now six minutes past ten\nMonths a forum on Michael Krasny northern California's sea lion population has been struck by an outbreak of disease which has exacerbated an already high death toll worrying biologist\nAnd the flare up of let those ferocious pathogen that causes kidney disease is the second largest since officials began tracking disease back in Nineteen Seventy the pathogen can also spread the people in dogs who come in contact with infected urine water or soil and joining us now\nTo explain what's going on with the current outbreak is Shawn Johnson he's director of veterinary science at the marine mammal center and welcome Shawn welcome back\nThank you thank you for having me good to have you uh this is a concern and it's not only concern to lovers of sea lions is of concern to people and a dog owners to and uh 'cause we're talking about something that's potentially lethal or this is a pretty high death toll and it's the second biggest as I said since Nineteen Seventy um\nWhat are we seeing here at at this point or at this juncture as it makes a difference [noise]\nYeah this this year as you said is the second highest number of a sea lions that we've rescued that have been diagnosed with left us for us this and and it is a very deadly disease and the sea lions are almost two thirds of the sea lines that we've rescued this year I'm having survived treat the disease and or the treatment that we can provide with them what's unusual\nAbout this that there had\nBeen a span of years almost four years where we didn't see any disease at all in our city line population or in the animals that were rescue seem to occur every four or five years these outbreaks typically we four or five years we have um outbreaks but almost ... between those major outbreaks we still see ... low levels of disease but um during\nThe last four years we saw no left us process and that's why\nThe diseases gotten I'm starting to spread in the population again and they were potentially a large numbers of sea lines that um we're susceptible to this disease had never seen it before and when the conditions seemed to allow this disease to spread among the population missing a large numbers of them I'm getting sick\nSo is there any way to account for this I mean we were looking at it a ... perspective a numbers back in twenty a lemon I think a couple of hundred cases we've kinda gone over that by now haven't we\nWere at two hundred and we're over two hundred and twenty cases uh right now and they're still we're still risking an average of five new felines a day\nAnd that is going down the whole cause that's going like from St Louis ... all the way up the Mendocino\nYeah that's that's the rescue arrange for the marine mammal center most of the sea lines or asking are in the Monterey Bay area here in San Francisco area and and some to our north and that's primarily due to where the sea lions are at this time of year with their migration patterns I tend to countries that are be up here in the in the northern part of California\nWe going to go to more of your calls let's go next to the color in Burlingame joining us Michael you're on the ... Mooney\n\nYes this is Michael can you hear me yes\nYeah so I'm a swimmer with adult them up and out of our neighbor neighbors shot than they might see like last year and the vice for people at some of the how to interact or avoid the Shiites decide not funny [noise]\n[noise] yeah I did there was definitely a few bites last year in the bay with with swimmers and um you know what that that\nYou know when you're swimming in the bay it's hard to avoid these animals and it's\nA it's important to not try to interact with them in and hopefully those bites and that incidences who um have stopped\nBut as far as being a plus electric ... says I Love to spy right doesn't survive very well in Salt water and and um you know the ocean is a big dilute or so it'd be very unlikely that a swimmer would would contract this disease\nIt's probably good news Michael but I thank you for the call and then once in a what do you do with all the animals that have died [noise]\nUh which is quite a few animals and we've had ordered to two twenty is are we do full autopsies new crops he's on them and collect samples for different research projects to better understand what what's different about this leapt compared to previous years um and then we are the carcasses that are left over 'em get incinerated and disposed of\nWe're talking if you just joined us about hundreds of sea lions are hit with a deadly disease let those ferocious a\nWhich affects the kidneys and can indeed be lethal and can affect humans and ... dogs and other mammals and Shawn Johnson is with us he's director of veterinary science and a veterinarian and he's with the marine mammal center in Sausalito and\nWe'll go to more of your calls and if you want to join us in the time remaining it's eight six six seven three three six seven eight six we go to Fairfax and David welcome you're on the air\nThank you you actually get answered my question with Michael earlier because I'm a surfer and I was curious about I kept in the water the other part was a\nWay in the area that higher risks than others for people to spend a lot of water\nHigher risk for those guys that's a very difficult question to answer um where there's a large number of a sea lions together there's going to be more um urine and other extra minutes into that environment so if you\nUm you know technically you're not supposed to be disturbing sea lions and getting that close to them so I I I Hope that if you keep your distance from the sea lions and where they are hauling out and and I'm living that you\nWould have pretty low risk of contracting the disease\nWhat about the risk for the ... cells you spoke before about the fact that you expect this number to rise at a maybe even go up to four hundred before we get to November um what can we do prophylactic clear is or anything because well\nThis is a naturally occurring disease in this population um there's there's no way to vaccinate a large population like this and and uh it it's a natural cycle where some animals get very sick and those are the ones that we're seeing another one's recovered from the disease and have immunity probably for the rest of their life from this disease or\nThere's just you know there's nothing that we can do for each individual for an individual sea lion um\nSponsorship of the cake weedy life's dream bike super micro at Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at for Mike Rowe dot com\nLike this ah what's more important is that we understand how this disease just cycling through this large population and and being able to predict when it's going to happen so like centers like us it's been almost in her are prepared to rescue an extra two hundred animals that we didn't we weren't accounting for\nAnd having the resources available to do that and then and this is a very unique disease dynamic that\nWill help scientists and research understand held up to ... and other infectious diseases may be affected by environmental changes in the future and how the environment can\nCan really change that a a disease dynamic in ecology that has been consistent for decades and then all of a sudden it changed because of increasing ocean temperatures is really a interesting a case study for environmental change and disease\nNikki wants to know what a share of ours are strains of the disease have been found in the sea lions I Know the dog leaped of vaccine only protects against for\nThe uh than the lines of strangers Pomona and uh I I Believe that is one of the strings it's also in the um dog a vaccine as well but but but dogs get 'em ... which is a different strain of of leaped to spider there's I Believe there's a couple of hundred different strings around the world\nFor exactly that question by Robbie says why are these animals being rescued doesn't that interfere with natural selection as well as decreasing the percentage of the population that has a more natural resistance to this type of infection [noise]\nMhm well there's a couple of reasons one is that uh we you know these animals are suffering and pain we we don't want to leave him on the beach to suffer and and we want to rescue and bring in and help the ones that we can in our facility and the ones that can't we wanted to help relieve the pain\nThe other one is is that we're we're able to to take a potentially infectious animal off the beach so that there is less exposure to humans and dogs you know if these animals are left out there for a long prison time there is more risk to the humans and dog population around the beaches\nSomebody else will be taking Darwinian ideas a little too extreme and yeah and we mentioned natural slicks yeah and and it does I mean that the the uh the biologist to study these populations do see that this when there's large outbreaks like this and this is the only ... is a decrease in the overall population for short period of time\nWe go to more of your calls so let's go next to you rub your on the air\nThank you um if the two part question about dog again wanted\nOur dog a within the city limits a [noise] a much at risk even though my dog is a puddle drinker but we don't go to the beach and the other is I had heard that there was some we used to get the vaccine all the time and she never had a problem that I'd heard stories about some bad side effects from the vaccine for dog\nShown yeah they're um I I practiced in small animal medicine for a while before I started doing re males fulltime and there was always a concern about um some of the the reactions to vaccines that individual Pesca now that it's always something that you should talk to your veterinarian about about the risk to your pet and\nI and many people who are just an opposition vaccines area\nAnd the likelihood of having a in a negative reaction to the vaccine you know I took my dogs out and went in the woods and heights in was around lots of other wildlife and that those and so I gave my dog leaped to suppress this vaccine\nAnd I think the caller and go to another caller and

with your general carcinoma and the ones with cancer do tend to have higher levels of pollutants and which are probably modulating their immune system and and\nHow you know a being a coal factor in

the culture becomes assimilated into the American fabric\nI still think that it's that it's there that it's there\nWe're talking with ... and his new book is red tabloid stories from a life lived along the border [noise]\nTalk about the the life that you've lived in a kind of interested in your revolution is a playwright because ah as I understand that uh\nI think you were set on being an actor even at an MSA enact a things began with your kissing or somebody on stage a portrayal in the diary of Anne Frank and I think I have that right here at and then um moved along the trajectory that we've got you into writing plays rather than acting in\nWell I started writing them as as a serving these plays and performing them in in New wave clubs that I worked in as a bartender simply as a way to sort of showcase my acting I wrote roles for myself\nBut I'm the people that I invited to to to see these works I'm I'm curious funny new wave vote Plato's you know they were\nMy my my friends are all remarked on the writing\nThe all like the writing and when I asked them what they started my acting they said you're okay you're All right it's All right now she's terrific she sort of like and I was always a impressive how uh at at how they kind of steered me there were the ones that Steve me more to the writing and like I felt like maybe that's what I really am\nSo I started to kind of lazy that got you know it was just curious now I've been here uh I I've I when I moved to San Francisco twenty five years ago I really got immersed in the theater scene here through the magic theaters through intersection for the arts\nUm and then I started working early was word for word which which is the company I'm working with um tonight was that they're they're staging a during a speech reading of five of selection of five of the problems from from my book\nAnd um and they're marvelous company by the way they've been during the institution and the city as well and um but it's really curious to kind of go from a ... a a a theater form\nAs from being a playwright working in theater to moving into fiction or memoir and then finding still that theater calls me back it's a theater that he's interested in in looking at these works um spin kind of a an interesting sort of circular kind of a movement\nWhere you're kind of at the top of your game though I mean you've been nominated for poetry when the William ing prize or\nAs achieving are really not only place that have had a great deal of impact a on folks who come to the theater yeah one more to come to the theater obviously [noise]\nUm but also recognized for the literary power your work and that brings me to Libya which was here in the marine theater about the forest family and this was a kind of play you never thought you would write [laughter]\nReally personal and it's also with the work that uh I I thought was going to be more of a real uh uh uh play that that would be framed in realistic mode kind of a kitchen sink drama\nAnd within the house I was in the house and a particular family I just never thought that I had that play in me and then when I did it\nUh uh I I I couldn't help but I'm the my in my opinion to the ... of my personal past of\nMy personal my own family my own upbringing and some lady in some way um valid gave me the courage\nTo venture into these are the problems I felt like if if I could do that and they ... which takes a certain amount of I think courage\nTo be able to draw upon your own family in this way I just felt like okay if I can do that then I can do the tablets as well\nWe should mention just for those who are familiar press with Lydia Lydia as a young girl by the Clinton era of fifteenth birthday celebration or [noise]\nThis is a horrible accident then becomes disabled and they get a caretaker who actually comes across the border and to take care of her and that's [noise]\nAh the woman who gives a play its title name um it's all about the

you know ... immigration but also\nPersonal family issues with my parents as they age as they deal with more of their the are the elements that come with age um it just it just felt like a suddenly more personal work\nNot looking at the dedication of tablets and it's very poignant a and it says a lot about the whole immigrant experience of what it means for so many it says for my father and
