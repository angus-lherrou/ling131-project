ongoing consequences of US military involvement in the middle east [noise]\nShe was one twenty Seventeen Pulitzer Prize in feature writing for his magazine story the fighter and he served as it entered the officer in the United States Marine corps and the Persian Gulf War welcome Christian is good to have you with us\nThanks very nice to be here\nWell she read your book and you come away thinking boy right after nine eleven uh we went to war which seemed a just war at the time because\nAl ... founded sanctuary in Afghanistan and somehow Afghanistan had to be kept from remaining sanctuary and it was in many ways of many people's minds at least a war that should have been thought\nAnd then there was Iraq War over weapons of mass destruction we should not have been flooded in many people's minds particularly now but these are two wars or just continues to go on with no end in sight and uh [noise]\nYou come away from your book just feeling that sense of the senseless in the civil war perhaps more environment above and beyond everything\nWill you certainly come away feeling the drift what you just described from the outset of the wars particularly after two thousand and one uh when there was a flash of patriotism in the country and and the military and then many new recruits to the military went overseas in the aftermath\nBut once we get to the Iraq period we entered a period of distraction and then drift it's sort of an endless reorganization of\nThe publicly stated reasons why we were in these countries are and they were conceptual failures as well and the wars which led to practical failures censor the book is in many ways about the individual experienced against this larger backdrop\nFor the book gives us a real human perspective I Know that was your intention and you succeed if I may say so in day to day combat and ... a day to day a combat entails\nWhen it involves for the individual soldiers of different services uh [noise] and I know you you run your order a under command I should say General Kelly for a while and you say positive things about him though it was a limited\nUh experience you had with him but you go after a lot of the generals and you go after a lot of those in the Pentagon to make these policies who may tactical and\nTerrible mistakes in many ways politicians as well who are separated from the real fighting so there's a disconnect\nAbsolutely between not just the generals but the whole system by which we manager words and the people who actually fight them and that disconnect\nCertainly exist at the generals level and many of the senior officers and senior military civilian leaders who who wrapped for these wars and who in some ways still do but\nThe failures larger than that it's our failure to as a populist our disconnect from the war as citizens uh is\nAnd everyone was affected in the book\nOr in line with reality became darker than my initial concept for it\nI Wonder how uh have you read several ... of the things they carried long ago yeah yeah well it stays in the mind those ... ... it's it's it's a great life isn't it\nPretty much that you portray here and then he portrays\nWell yes I mean I ...\nA lot of history you know you talked about generals and we were a few minutes ago a lot of the history of war too much for my blood comes from the perspective of generals and policymakers and strategic thinkers and not enough comes from sergeants and the like people who stand near and with sergeants and\nI think that this is a history of the war from people sergeants and people in proximity to search that's intentional\nAnd my own inquiry on the war I mean I I work for a big newspaper and we can cover the war in a lot of different ways\nAnd that allows individual reporters to specialize or differentiate or have different lanes and the beat so during my time covering the words I never met David ... Stanley McChrystal or many of the brand names never try to didn't want to\nI wanted to cover the bottom a I wanted to cover the rank and file we had plenty of people covering the Pentagon or people passing through Brussels to cover NATO I'm way people covering our allies weed people into capitals covering the embassies and\nAs they say in the military you know the big blue arrow uh was well amplified in the press I wanted to get at the human experience down below and that brought me to the grants that also lined with my own experiences maybe where I was best\nI'm able to apply personal ones because I'd been one of them here in the Persian Gulf War no more than that it was an infantry I spent years in the infantry and went through the same schools\nUm I went through the same schools and many of the same experiences as these young soldiers and Marines I Know the language I Know their acronyms I Know what it's like to live on the ground a\nFor a long period of time I've done in some way sort of made out of wood so I'm Still able to do that or I was during those years and I thought I should cover them because they were under represented to there'd be days one in particular I remember I was invited to go see General McChrystal and\nI had the opportunity instead to walk with a corporal and a squad patrol\nAnd I remember thinking to myself ... the general as reporters followed him wherever he goes no one ever talks to the court for all I'm going out with the corporal thank you very much\nThis is where I think a literature and I'm I'm a self confessed or to you literary guy but where it's made a great impact of going back to Stephen Crane and mailers and making the dead and have any way I mean these are writers who bring somehow war to us through the eyes of those who fight in the infantry or those who were the combatants and so forth I mean [noise]\nAh in in cases like Tim O'Brien or having me to actually served in the military and they have these same experiences you did and so\nThey're able to make it vivid and not see it from the the war makers policy type people and [noise] had software that uh ... what are you still what do you like the effect of this book to be I mean you get a sense of these soldiers' lives and you get a sense of their courage and their selflessness and also their heart aches um [noise]\nYou want to make it human I Know that you've said that your intent\nTheir heart aches um [noise] you want to make it human I Know that you've said that your intention but for the reader what is it the one\nI liked it but it's clear that people haven't paid as much tension or the war just as I Would like and there's clear reasons for that but one of the reasons why people are very busy we we get to exercise a lot of time\nTo read and we're bombarded with all sorts of forms of media I tried to make the book so that if someone wanted to spend a few nights with just one book a few hours here a few hours there and get to the and read a few hundred pages that the reader would leave with\nA strong vivid sense of many of these\nCommon ... Singh ... experience with these last two wars\nThat was my hope for the reader that way you got to the end of this book which shouldn't take you to too much time you'll understand something of who served at what it was like for them I tried to take a cross section that would deliver that too so that was my ambition for readers to create\nThe possibility for a fairly accessible and quick\nUnderstanding of what it's like I\nJust want us to feel the wounds and the suffering these men went through\nWar is bad for you there's no way to write honestly about war and not show that so it wasn't a question of whether I wanted that to come there it was essential that it would have been dishonest if it wasn't president\nYou take us into their lives are in fact I'm thinking about one of the more of\nIn some ways jogging or narratives about a man who uh gets wounded in his face and winds up in fact be visited by George W. Bush no less a architect of the Iraq War with long with Chaney\nAnd just feeling what he feels under those circumstances I mean you're outside of it but at the same time I almost feel like you're there inside of\nYou know that's that's dot Caribbean he's he's invited to go visit a former President Bush the Bush librarian Texas and he's with his family so the whole family goes and they haven't had any warning it's like you know they're invited if I remember right one afternoon other there the next morning they don't even have time to get to go get I mean they they were at a\nTexas motor speedway watching a NASCAR race they didn't even have time to\nDress in line with what you'd expect the dress code to visit the president in his office um\nDot Kirby was when he was very ... in in some ways\nHe was confused and felt a certain limit to how much he can say and didn't know that he'd be able to explain his experience to his commander in chief and the few minutes that\nThose types of interactions allow and so he um he ... he tried to navigate it in an understated way and not say much and it was really ... mom\nWho opened up and it spent the night before in a hotel room practicing a monologue uh that she delivered to the to the president because she wanted some assurances and some validation that the president was aware of what these wars at cost and not just a doctor but\nTo docks entire family I mean at this point\nThere's several years after ... had been wounded he'd been through a few dozen surgeries maybe not that many I think about thirty surgeries um\nHe battled addiction depression\nPost traumatic stress disorder divorced and he had a suicide attempt and been arrested I mean his life she'd gone from being someone who's quite literally in his own explicit way want it to be a hero wanted to go to war\nI wanted to participate was enthusiastic as you could get I mean all of his meters were pegged to the right he'd gone\nFrom that person to me and someone disfigured grievously wounded in pain in despair and feeling abandoned and lonely and that and living with his family and that his parents and that of course had taken a tremendous toll on all of them\nThis toll exists in many families across the country and he said it just started this nearly seven thousand Americans in uniform died in these two wars but tens of thousands more were wounded and many other have unseen ones as we call them you know come home with\nA psychological or moral freight and burdens that they're still working through and this is heavy upon the families and it largely has gone on acknowledged\nAnd if that's an ... even to a greater extent if that's possible we have not acknowledged and all the\nPain and suffering of Iraqis and Afghans families and of those who died in combat in of all the corruption I mean when you write about uh for example you can sell a pistol a [noise]\nTo jihadi for example and get much more than you can make working in a [noise] the armed forces of either those armies you know it kind of it it bears right in on some of the things that we really have to grapple with an ought to be grappling with the fact that there's a moment open to the phones for listeners\nWould like to hear your views of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have they changed over time and if you've served\nIn Iraq or Afghanistan what should the rest

generals from all back from China Burma India or the holy land a Berlin ... a London and back to the United states in July of\nI'm a Nineteen forty five\nI'm Wondering what we can do for veterans I as a veteran type magazines over to the voluntary services at the\nA VA hospital they take the last four months of magazines and they take all National Geographic and apparently the the veterans there are a lot of the national geographic so I Want to urge all people in the bay area and the fact around the country to see how they can help out\nVeterans and I want to ask you how we\nCan further help our veterans\nCan further help our veterans [noise]\nOh are you familiar with the source of the Ploughshares will just put a plug in for them 'cause I Am Caesar annual dinner every year um soon as we do know\nAbout them first you know that they do a lot for veterans are Michael Black or decided that organization and you know hats off to him and perhaps to them when I had anything here Chris\nI mean what many veteran's grave coming home uh is not just understanding because I understand it can be hard to ask for but the integration into community\nBeing in a in a combat unit a is incredibly bonding and very very very socially rich and you form these friendships and sense of shared understanding and sense of purpose that when you leave the unit\nAre are caught or not at least not available to you as they once were and when you come back into civilian life\nYou're looking often for some if not substitute something they can at least fill a portion of that that missing feeling that you had and people get it from churches they get it from\nSports leagues some of them to see if you could be an adrenaline rush though can to to do well that's that's that's another yeah yeah that's that's another element but that's not that's not the social piece that I'm Talking about as much\nAnd one of the main things we can do for veterans is just bring them back into our lives\nIntroduce yourself talk to them get to know them invite them in your life give them a job\nOr through your arm around them socially\nUh magazines and other gestures are helpful and welcome anything is really welcome sincere\nBut you know ... ... veterans had a community that was their unit and their service uh that was their time in their place their outpost when they were stationed in Afghanistan or Iraq or Syria or the horn of Africa or elsewhere um\nThat sense of community something um that many of them or used to and would like to have again in some way so anything that is sincere and that offers them a place is usually welcome\nI was reading about some of those who received a national Congressional Medal of honor and ah the the courage under fire I mean [noise]\nYou know some of it comes from the bond that you were talking about but you know these are men who put themselves in harm's way\nBelieving almost without any doubt and ... with with certainty that they're going to be killed but to save their buddies you know and they come through it somehow miraculously but they go right into impossible situations putting their lives at risk and these are unbelievable stories\nIt's worth noting to Michael the valor is much more common than the award system recognizes the word system is often skewed towards officers and senior enlisted and all shocking about the kind of guys you writing they edited junior rank\nAnd file there's so much unrecognized Fowler a and with that unrecognized valor that you know people come home they vividly have these experiences in their head still and there are around us I mean three millions I said one percent of the country it's not\nMy land them suffering too and it I mean suffering from ... to begin with I mean for openers but from so many flashbacks and you know her son to the noise and I think they're under fire and [noise]\nLet me read some comments coming in just apropos what you said before about the draft Michael writes we've created a class of individuals who were doing the dirty work over and over again most of us did not have any personal connection to this activity if we had a draft there would be students and families protesting in the streets of San Francisco once again maybe even\nIn the streets in the south from where most of our troops come\nSteve says frankly my views on the wars haven't changed much at all even as a freshman in college I thought the wars were idiotic with no clear plan\nCriteria for success and more likely to make lives worse in those countries in better surprise I was right\nAnd give them some satisfaction to say that but the sense was for many people that these wars made no sense and I think would you've suggested is if there was any sense initially for example with Afghanistan and it was invented seemed to be much sense now despite the fact that ah there's still\nAn argument to be made that the Taliban are able to take over the country and have at least the resources and possibilities taking over the country again\nAnd we know what happened with that\nI Choose a slightly more subtle way of saying that I wouldn't want to be quite so binary rather than say there is censor no sense a\nWhat we don't have is clearly articulated goal\nClearly articulated realistic goal that we all understand and share as a society and then a planned organized or resources towards that goal\nIn other words we have to find the end a realistic and\nWe don't know what the end would look like\nHave you know at the end of look like if you don't know what the end it looks like ... or how you're getting there you don't have your resources aligned with it so it feels like drifted looks and feels like drift because in fact it is drift maybe someone at the center of this knows what they're doing but they certainly haven't made it convincing public case\nThat will bring some more of our public aboard here we go to UNIX Joe you're on the air\nI yeah I I'm a was none of the program and I think it's great um I just wanted to I I started over in Iraq from all five do sex as a reserve is um and uh and the last ... what what was called the iron high angle\nI gotta tell ya I spent a year there and everybody always thinks the hard part is going over a to be honest the artist art with actually coming back home because [noise] it was very disconnected um harder relate\nEverything but ah I appreciate the show and I'll take your comments off line\nBy comments Chris thank you for the call\n\nThat's Chris thank you for the call\nComing home a and trying to process these things or even explain these things to others um\nIs in many ways harder than going over and going over can be hard and being there can be really hard and I think what the caller just said\nIs a a commonly shared experience by all sorts of people who went I mean one thing I'll I'll I'll risk which you're still on the line of risk sane is a reservist if they're in a reserve unit a\nMore National Guard unit that has a local component that isn't during in other words community members who served part time but remain living in the community sometimes can have it a little bit better because people they serve with are still around them they're not scattered to fifty states um and I hope that's the case for you\nThen writes thank you for your service what are some things that were actually done rights what did you just think about all the Bush administration not letting the press videotape the caskets coming back from the wars\nSo at the tactical level a lot was done right um [noise] it takes a while for tactics to catch up to circumstances and it takes even longer for equipment or to catch up the circumstances and so in these wars it probably wasn't until two thousand and six or seven where\nThe equipment the armor uniforms helmets a match the worst but it came to with time uh and the tactics of all much more quickly than that so I think there are unbalanced many people at the middle and the bottom who can take\nPride in satisfaction in their roles in what they did in how they acted was what they had a lot of that was done right um and as for the\nThe caskets a\nWhile I Am I'm obviously for the first amendment I obviously if I'm writing about war I care about war words public activity it should have as much public scrutiny as possible\nWhen you say you're for the first amendment defined that many of the soldiers are [noise] have a strong almost a religious commitment to the idea of fighting for the country being tied to the belief in the constitution the belief in liberties and principles for which this country likes to ideally Stan\nMany do I mean I again I Want to be careful of universal um and when you're out with

the ills that Brazil is suffering oversee the poster boy bang Lula da Silva um\nBut it's just to see the division and the hatred that came from these elections has just been so dramatic hair and I think it's a ... a special case in the region\nWell there's several of course was serving a twelve year prison term for corruption and money laundering or but the left or was being blamed as you suggest a for just about everything that's going wrong in Brazil and much has gone wrong but now we have someone and I just like you're kind of character\nSense of ... months in our own self because he's been compared I think\nMany instances to Donald Trump is that kind of right wing populists to use allied with the ... and the religious right and his rhetoric is against gays and women and certainly are those\nWho are in the minority cast\nYeah he's nicknamed the Trump in the tropics asked me the rest of them in our TV decry fake news it criticism a level at hand but I think a lot of people would say that he is more extreme than Donald Trump people with a lot of people ... like an empty Rodrigo detached day of the Philippines\nI'm sure you're familiar with this surgery murder and she shot a\nMugger and shot him to death and there was a great deal of like I said the word celebration might be appropriate to win this went viral let me uh I mean she had children and they were in harm's way by who smuggler and so\nIt seemed appropriate for people to be maybe packing as we say here in the United states let me go to a caller and a caller from Brazil is Erbil joined us\nHigh yes Israel you're on the air\n[noise] yeah um I I Am very concerned about um\nWhich I work for not particularly concerned about the privatization that might happen I'm particularly in the universities and the health system and also concerned about the role of women interest high\nAnd the traditional family values is that you both and I had said that women do they're less rights than men in the workplace it's okay for did they paid less I'm Wondering how that will play out in the country and the next few years\nYou're reaching important questions as a bonus thank you for the ... through your thoughts about the questions that are very serious in Brazil right now other than ...\nIndeed Isabel suits you you know I think it is about for calling um [noise]\nSo ... a question or it's unclear at this point what do actually tried to privatize he has an economic good rules so to speak a that is a very liberal man that does want to propose a number of a liberal policies including ... station off\nOn a very large number of state owned enterprises\nHowever there's other people are in the ensemble or that are supporting both or not they're not so liberal um I Would count that phone call goes and even the military that have\nA history of more nationalistic stances when it comes to the participation of the state in the economy and we're not sure yet we checked his forces is actually going to prevail\nPlus a lot of himself has been walking back and some statements that he made a ... um he already said if he does not plan to privatize strategic companies quote unquote on putting pets are past the auto company or electoral bats are public utility I'm there have been suggestions off a\nChanging the methods of how a public a house and public education I offered in the country but we don't know yet what our actual proposals that are going to be presented and definitely that's going to\nUm require a larger debate within society and even in Congress so it's not like you know any of the proposals have a blank check to be implemented a overnight\nOr in about women um there is no question that some of his statements have been detrimental to the role of women in society he has a Center for example it's hard for someone that hires the woman shouldn't deal with the fact that you may get pregnant and have maternity leave in Brazil\nUm so I think it's important that society and Congress even becomes very vigilant about potential threats to a minority rights in Brazil\nUm even though those words I think a powerful and they do I'm encouraged groups in society that that support that kind of stands to come out I don't think that's necessarily means that those rights are going to be curbed\nUh I think that if the the role of the whole society to be vigilant now and talk to him and also there's like I said a number of people around him that the non spouses instances of that have been working actively to moderate his positions food so I guess we're going to have to uh do a little bit of waiting and seeing what actually gets proposed\nWhen we started about for the call will get it on his many callers as we can get on to emerge as we're so since she directs operations for North America and Joe Torre and next caller is Daniel Daniel welcome\n[noise] hard I work with survival international an organization that works for support and digital and traveled peoples around the world including in Brazil and we're strongly concerned about both in our the lecture and they're really dire applications for indigenous peoples they're both in our ... maybe anti and the jets he said\nDentist people's they're both in our ... maybe anti indigent as he said Indian smell they're uneducated they don't speak the national language and that the recognition that of indigenous land which I should add if the best barrier to deforestation and the Amazon\nOptical typically agribusiness he wants to get ranchers gun [noise] and so when did it if people have already vulnerable and they're faint pilots in a full term agribusiness and other actors and his election will likely\nLead to more killing more vision of land and destruction of the environment including the Amazon that many indigenous peoples including isolated and\nContacted tribes the ... that you're giving out and it's and it's one of great concern to environmental is as I said earlier in fact\nLooking at another listeners car question bill he says how do we stop the total destruction in the Amazon has a digital people now because that really seems to be at risk and many people's minds in teetering here and I'd be emergency you talked about some checks and balances are intimated that there are on a bus in our what about what the Amazon or the digital population\nWell hopefully they'll be at the same as the question off the indigenous lands had has been raised as one that would encounter judicial issues on so he would not be and not be so easy for any government to implement\nPolicies that curb the rights of indigenous people to dedicate the land and and have those reserves are really protected on the Supreme Court on would definitely have a role in preventing that because it was frankly be just unconstitutional\nA we have been hearing signals from people that support person out of that may or may not come to join his cabinet are that are definitely more I'm pro developmental policies on such a speaking the Amazon\nUm but they have also sad that the plants are followed it for US Code we may have another problem chest to discuss that the the fairness and their progress and not the first called in Brazil but um what we're hearing so far is that they do plan to follow the letter of the law so there's you know the it's not\nSo easy to imagine that they apocalyptic all scenario even they're all from the rhetoric alone\nThat are those are definitely legitimate concerns and like I said I think everyone a civic groups in society Congress or the ... gonna have to be vigilant to make sure that those rights are not a infringed upon\nWell there's certainly a great deal at risk here in the balance as far as the environment let me think Daniel for the call I Want to get more calls but\nWhat I ask you Andrew if you have a thought about the speculation involving what might be done to my door on Venezuela because certainly ... announced himself as a Adam at a inanimate opposition to the president Venezuelan government there's been talk about maybe an alliance with Colombia\nActing together with Brazil to essentially opposed the door or remove him\nMhm so there has been this type of conversation a what we heard publicly from demand and has been tapped as potential next to a defense minister which is tied to general called ... he sat as he is opposed to any direct intervention in Venezuela\nAnd that but they might adopt a harsh stance so I think it's easier to conceive that Brazil will for example\nUm impose unilateral sanctions or closed the border or two on other measures that are not you know that they're shy of an actual violent intervention to topple governmental from neighboring country but that we can certainly expects a harsher stance than we've seen so far\nBut I Want to get Chris on her because she's been waiting patiently Chris go ahead\nYes for the last Fifteen Years in ... America many of the ships from a ... government\nHas been at least facilitated by the CIA sometimes like in Chile an actual military intervention um what's the relationship between the U.S and Brazil and how active or we or white wing\nYou know political or in the United states involved in this stuff for we stand out\nSoon important question we've got a very little time left but ah want to go to you on the ... century merger with the we should just bring it right up to the president of a President Trump seems to be on very good relationship with the bunch when are we congratulated him and he said very favorable things about him at least that's where we are right now\nYeah we see both presidents trying to um at least sound suggest a new closeness between visiting the United states\nAnd I am not aware and I do not think that the um that political establishment or the CIA or intelligence services in the U.S had any real whatsoever and does election\nI Do know that time listen son had gone to vote for NATO had a meeting with Steve Bannon who is no longer a in the U.S government that they they deed at talk and they plan to get together in the future so there is a likeness of mines there but I don't see any actual active role\nWe will have to leave it to her under emerges many thanks to you for being with us this morning on foreign appreciated it's been a pleasure I think putting a station we also it can be watching and we're going to have another segment of form right up ahead stay tuned we're going to be talking about connections between divisive rhetoric and violence what are they will find out\n\nWas coming up in our second hour this morning at Penn as part of our election twenty aging coverage we hear from two of the top three candidates running for Oakland Mayor civil rights attorney ... price and activists Brooks spin a tense already we talk was even vaguely Republican candidate for California attorney general to listen to the parents\nShows

unique shape weight and temperature learn more leap world dot com [noise]\nWell we're certainly not at that stage here in America we are that this rhetoric only rarely manifests itself in somebody taking matters into their own hands and being moved towards a the sort of violence\nMost people here this authorizing a and they hear the demonizing of opponents and they understand it's rhetoric they understand it's about politics and about\nTrying to motivate people to take political action like voting but as I said in any population there's going to be a people on the fringes of people who hear this and in different ways and feel so threatened by the rhetoric\nThat they move towards violence so I don't think we're at a period of mass mobilization towards violence\nBut we are in a dangerous place\nAnd there is a dangerous place a need to be seen also just from words that are so [noise]\nUh in some ways inappropriate I mean evil is a theological profound word and when the president talks about uh the press being evil or when he talks about the reporters being evil and so forth um\nIt has an effect on very susceptible minds and has an effect on people who are maybe walking on the line in terms of their um mental abilities to sort out things as you were suggesting\nI think so and and also damages are kind of our national credo our understanding of our system works I mean the press is critical to a free society\nYou can't have liberal governance and I don't mean liberal in terms of liberal versus conservative but ... you can have modern democracy the functions without a strong independent press to hold government officials accountable to educate the populace so they can responsibly\nSo they can responsibly exercise their franchise all these things are so critical and so when the president is trying to degrade\nThe institution of the media what he's doing Israeli degrading the foundations of American democracy it is deeply deeply disturbing\nOf course you can criticize certain press coverage in an article a story that didn't think was fair that was an factual I think the press is open to having that conversation the president is demonizing depressed as an institution\nAnd that is so profoundly wrong and so ... inconsistent with our democratic traditions\nBut evil is such a heavy word Carolyn ... let me go back to you on this I mean it's a word that carries so much ... to power in many people's minds particularly the associated with it so it was said in with the devil loose of her and so forth\nWell there isn't any question that what this divide has evolved into people making moral judgments about each other and the president is reinforcing that when he uses the word evil and calling the press evil calling Democrats evil\nSo it legitimate to people feeling\nIf you are and the other party than I Am by definition you are I'm morally superior to you and your actions could in fact be dangerous to our democracy when at the bottom line what's dangerous to our democracy is this kind of demonization this kind of setting people apart\nAs if if you are not with me you are against me and there's one of two camps and there's no way to bring these camps together\nThat's the pattern that has become the basis of political rhetoric in the last four years really\nWhat the hopeful sign is Michael we do work all across the country and communities where one on one conversations small groups of people large community meetings four or five hundred people\nAmericans of all stripes no where we've come to in our public in political discourse is wrong and they really feel the pain in the anxiety and the anger of the separation in deep divide and they actually want to do something about it\nBut they are constantly reinforced that this is the new reality we're in so we have to do things in our communities\nThat actually gives people the experience again of I can have voted for Trump than you and can have voted for Hillary that we actually could have a conversation with each other and we might even we might even be surprised to find out that we agree on a lot more than we thought we did\nSo this impulse this desire to do something to cross this divide is very very profound not in the fire extremes on the far right probably Fifteen Percent of people are twelve to Fifteen and on the far left smaller eight to ten but that leaves Seventy five to eighty percent of us\nWho know what we are currently experiencing of the east coast of our political rhetoric is wrong is on democratic and frankly is unhealthy in our lives I Want to take\nThis opportunity issues me Carolyn to invite listeners to join us ah and in fact I encourage listeners to weigh in here I Would like to hear what you have to say about this and

don't necessarily think that a grocer development or serious or bad problems you would\nTake that on I presume I I Would I think that what we want to have the development rich out displacement because

beautiful city at the same time we want to make sure that that development come\nOut with a view to protecting and preserving our legacy our history our neighborhoods and making sure that people who have\nUm are from Oakland and have lived in Oakland for decades that we protect our character and allow people to remain that without being displaced by economic development so one of the major reasons you're running for office yeah I've been in Oakland for forty years and\nIt is a place that has a birth so many social movements and yet we are at risk\nOf displacement tremendous displacement as reflected in the homelessness crisis and particularly as impacting the African American community\nAnd before we go to the crisis or talk about housing with your cat Brooks while you're running for mayor\n[noise] um I'm running for a multitude of reasons first is over the last four years what I've seen happen to the city of Oakland breaks my heart\nThat six to nine thousand now advocates are saying on how people sleeping on the streets every night\nThe fact that yes we are building housing but we're not building housing for the majority of Oakland there's that need it which is at what

think that the mayor will definitely\nNeed to represent the voices of those who are most at risk of being abandoned in this situation I also would like to and have suggested that we bring other teams

by the grace of God and through having an education going to Yale and then UC Berkeley law school\nI Am firmly a proponent of a moratorium on charter schools in Oakland I think that charters have undermined\nThe public school system and that is fundamental that we that the mayor yes work with the school district to ensure that we reverse the trend that has overwhelmed our public school of having charter schools and charter school money coming into our district\nAnd that we support the public schools and the we take back the board of education that we create\nUm a community based

but as we exercise our power\nUh at the ballot as we've ... recognize that we have supported the Democratic party and have been at the heart of the Democratic party some people say I'm a Fannie Lou Hamer Democrat um but I Do come from an era where I remember Shirley Chisholm\nAnd I remember a Barbara Jordan and so to me the current activism of black women is not anything that is new I'm I'm Glad

we've got ... seconds left so we have to just ask you really quickly respond Minnesotans are so I'd like to recount his views on how urban revitalization as possible without this placement I'm a resident of east Oakland and illegal dumping for examples rapid seems like these issues can be addressed without displacement but they never are\nRight so I I'll just give one ideas because he said we're seconds I really think that we need to be working in partnership with Lenny college to create technical business programs for small business owners and east Oakland so that we can have people from that community creating their own businesses and generating income in the city\nAnd other quick idea from you on this than I think that the city at administration led by a mayor who come from this community should be in partnership with the community working to identify\nAreas where we need to clean up illegal dumping and accelerate our efforts to address it particularly and do it in a fair manner across the city will thank you both\nIn a minute this woman with him a price against civil rights attorney and kept books at least her project\n\nThis was coming up tomorrow on foreign

penalty or going back to three strikes you're talk for example a moment ago Stephen Bailey about um prosecuting crimes like breaking windows and and and getting them getting tougher on crimes or how do you do that\nHow would you do well well obviously we're going to have to make some significant changes to some of the propositions that have been passed a prop forty seven being a poster child of\nDecriminalization of property crimes um it it was essentially a blanket solution that uh didn't take into account the real consequence to the victims of crime and we need to\nSponsorship as a cake

a position where it makes sense for them to\nInvestigate and then a rest in those crimes um to get us to the point where we have\nWhat I Would consider equilibrium or in the criminal justice process we need to go back take another careful look at a B. one oh nine which was a prison realignment\nUm you know we've we essentially through ab one oh nine filled up our county jails [noise]\nUm and created a situation where longer and longer sentences were being served on the county level that I'm\nWithout a appropriate funding for our local uh counties created a um\nThat basically filled up our local ... local jails to the point where we started allowing a the release of individuals had\nCommitted what we're being called lower level crimes those lower level crimes are those individuals and went out and committed new crimes\nBecause he wasn't a done because now we had the ... the prisons were simply too crowded we had to diminish number who are there under law under federal law\nWell that was a policy decision or the policy was we weren't going to building more prisons so by not building any more prisons and then we were faced with the federal courts a border that you reduce population\n... when you make a policy decision a ... there's there are different alternatives the alternative that was taken was we're just not going to spend money but that didn't create that didn't didn't lessen the pressure\nOr on the criminal justice system and now it's even greater because the pressure's been place not on the\nState which had the responsibility for these higher level a criminals but ah now has a has placed the pressure directly on the local\nGovernment and at a point in time um if their jails are full\nUm they don't have the money in place for the appropriate programming that used to be done by the way at the state prison level\nThat was what we were we used to prevent recidivism now we don't have those programs in place for the most part uh and yet we are incarcerating people for longer and longer periods of time at the local\nLevel how is that a lot of callers who want to address issues that we've been talking about and ask questions if you let me begin with Martin Martin you're on\nHey great program certainly appreciate the dark hair um other than for or against the death penalty issue I have is that the length of time what someone is convicted\nOr their actual reactor\nUm you know other country certainly my tractor profit or it just seems like what you were ill or could be done to extradite that ... that we don't get someone like that for over Twenty years or even thirty or forty or they're finally comes to term\nSee highly let me think early on that and thanks for the question Martin\nEat that is a great question and I think I'm the solution to it is to have\nA a group of very qualified uh prosecutors and defense attorneys you can't do it you know one without the other um the defense bar has been essentially under funded\nConsequently many of the people on death row don't have lawyers and if they don't have a lawyer then you can't proceed through the system to ensure that due process is done as you pointed out earlier\nUm you know there have been some people who have been executed or in the past who were\nInnocent and if you don't have quality attorneys handling those cases you're going to get to that injustice I don't want it ... the injustice to occur um\nThere was an all around us to know how would you expedite or is there a way to expedite because the process is very long and sometimes never\nSure because if you have lawyers on the case is\nRight now a lot of our inmates on death row have no lawyers so their cases are just in limbo until you find a lawyer for him so you've got to go out and recruit and make sure that your defense bar is as robust as your ah ah\nProsecutors let me get another caller about and that's that it'll speed it up okay Jay you're on go ahead\nGood

your lexicon or in your\nQuit is absolutely because it but I think a lot of that takes place beginning at the level of the trial level and the trial judges\nUm it gave me no pleasure as a judge to send someone to prison I wanted them to rehabilitate I'm generally a person had to go through the the process and screw up on\nMany occasions before they ended up in state prison [noise] um I couldn't get to everybody but I Try to provide the services um if they were mentally ill or had drug addiction we wanted to make sure that we provided those services up front\nThe problem is in a lot of instances California's laws haven't kept up with the need for a providing that service for example in our mental health system and tell you are a essentially\nUm a danger to yourself or others um we don't have services for somebody that's say moderately mentally ill in this state we need to address that problem so that the judges and prosecutors and defense bar have someplace to send these people\nUm we also need to um beef up in and give some muscle back to the courts so that you can encourage drug addicts to get into treatment because by the criminalizing or drugs what we ended up with the is\nGiving somebody that's in the criminal justice system the incentive to just go to jail for a few days um and then go back out and get high again and that doesn't solve any problems and
