extreme frustration and today and four and we're going to talk about two new reports on the state of local roads\nA recent report on congestion by the San Francisco county transportation authority found that ride service firms like over and lift we're responsible for about half of the increased traffic on city streets between twenty ten and twenty sixteen over lift issued statements pushing back against the report was listening Jesse and might actually reduce traffic\nAnother study by a research group that represents road builders insurers and transportation interests finds that\nThe pothole ridden the streets and roads in San Francisco Oakland a nearby cities are the worst in the nation with road conditions causing bay area drivers expensive car repairs were going to find out more about both of these studies and what they mean for commuters joining us here in Studio ...\nTransportation editor and reporter with the news when he's in good morning Michael it will also say good morning to the deputy director for technology data and analysis of the San Francisco county transportation authority and that's a joke actually only when we are glad to have you with us welcome\nPsychic morning Michael morning dad hey good morning the morning to both\nOf you and I chose the author of the report the science of companies like uber and Lyft is caused increase congestion so let's go right to the heart of the matter who was who Joe I mean first of all let's talk about um what Hoover and lift are doing because they're talking very much like the they're not doing what you say they're doing\n[noise] well I mean I Can't speak to what our findings are this is the second in a series of reports that we have put forward looking at the question of GM seeds in San Francisco\nLast summer we put out a report called GMC today and the motivation for that was because a lot of people said hey there seem to be a lot of tea and sees on the street today but we had no data that although\nWe got married last last ask you what a TNT as\nI should ... sorry I Can't see strands for transportation network company and that's the kind of legal term for looper it left a and other companies as well and so again there was this perception that there were a lot of these New Britain lift vehicle out of the street but nobody knew how many\nAh they do report it to the California public utilities commission which regulates them but the the PUC wouldn't share it with out we were able to get some data by feeding with some researchers Northeastern University\nAnd what our study revealed was that there are a lot of these trips happening in San Francisco they were mostly happening in the most congested parts of the city and many of those trips were happening at the most congested times of day\nHowever that report was not able to answer a lot of key question our a board at a public we're asking such as\nOur we were left these TNC is contributing to congestion and that's what this report answers that question the TNC super left defect roadway congestion at San Francisco and by how much\nCan you talk about the methodology uh I was talking to Dan Burton before I went on the air about a ... for example or the traffic analytics but also uh there's something that uh almost is mind boggling you you have a\nWrote a scooter over here from sixteenth street part I was really glad to find went out there because it allowed me to get here on time [noise] but um no so ... left have a couple of big a push backs here I mean\nYou know what they you know they feel like the methodology is flawed and they um point to two big factors one is the study doesn't explicitly account for the impact of tourism\nUm it it turns out that if you poke into ... and tourism is up phenomenally over the the last uh you know several years going back to twenty tennis up something like thirty seven percent so we've got about twenty five million people coming into the city every year\nFor quote unquote tourist purposes so those are convention goers and\nConference goers and then people just coming in for the day\nBut I'm the statistics from the the tourists folks show that most of the people still seem to be taking transit were walking to their to their destination and you would that's not entirely surprising for conference goers for instance\nUm the other thing that has happened on the street is that we have new delivery services right there are um meal delivery and package delivery services and then there's an increase in e commerce that uh has caused a lots more vehicles to be on the street we think\nBut you know common sense would suggest in and actually I'm just quoting the transportation authority and is\nThat probably a lot of those deliveries are just replacing trips that might have happened anyway\nSo in terms of that kind of methodology those claims about poor methodology is it's really hard to see how they'll stand up now the thing that uh Joe mentioned that's that bears repeating his all this data that they used is actually been publicly a relief sits there are links on the transportation authority website\nAnd they've invited people to uh to to crunch the numbers themselves look at the methodology and come to their own conclusions about um about where it might be improved well let me invite\nOur listeners to join us on this uh you know some of you may indeed want to respond to the report was put up by the transportation authority [noise] what do you think the effect is mover and live to these right services uh in terms of\nOwn problems with traffic congestion and you can join us now that are toll free number let me invite you to do that\nThat number is eight six six seven three three six seven eight six we welcome your calls so feel free to be part of the program again the number to call eight six six seven three three six seven eight six you can also of course joined us by email forum at ... dot org or go to

Seventy one percent of the streets of San Francisco Oakland a nearby cities are dilapidated in San jose is not far behind in sixty nine percent of the big emphasis of this report is that\nUm that essentially the streets are in serious problem and the terrible repair and uh that brings us to the gas tax than directly I mean you have to wonder about the timing of this I Do I must confess\nWell I mean if you read the report that was put out by this organization trip and trip uh\nUsed to stand for the road improvement program it's a sort of an industry Reuben who's a construction firms are engineering firms labor unions in the insurance companies\nAnd the light and um you know they've been putting out this report and it's based on government data or what what the state's report to the federal government and if you read the report um there is a pitch in the California versions of the report for\nFor SP one for I'm Sorry for the the increase gasoline tax that that is part of the solution to improving these roads but to back up just a little bit yes these reports have showed\nUm bay area roads and roads and other parts of California it'd be pretty rough shape for a long time um\nYou know the the share of roads that are said to be in poor condition and that's based on the\nSomething called the international roughness index um I just love that term uh but I'm the their share that aren't in poor condition it's Seventy one percent or sixty four percent in San jose in fifty seven percent in Los Angeles and then there are lots of other places\nA nearby that show up here like smaller cities Antioch in Concord all both have more than fifty percent of the roads\nAnd then as you were talking about to the to the motorists who are listening to this or in their cars I mean ... over a thousand dollars a year in terms of what\nThey say that the increased costs from from everything or repairs or reduce gas mileage um delay all that you know a total together is more than a thousand dollars\nAnd they're also saying the costs are going up because as such the you've got all this pavement deterioration costs go up when that happens in terms of fixing and maintaining\nAnd the cost of repairing a car never goes down\n[laughter] ah there's a an extreme to live by well we're going to go to your calls and emails and you can join us on this report as well which was also released by the very Metropolitan Transportation committee and are interested in a given the timing of this report ah\nLet me just interject something there the Metropolitan Transportation commission actually released a different report which also looked at pavement conditions\nAnd they noted that it does telling industries for welders similar similar and and what that report shows the gives a score for pavement the region and it's not a good score a doesn't really mean anything by itself but say it's sixty seven\nAnd what they pointed out is that is still make it worse of the nation [laughter] yeah it's it's bad but the uh what they point out is that over the last Fifteen Years\nUm it's risen four points from I think sixty three and needs to get to eighty five to be good and so at that rate or will it will be the end of the twenty first century before we see good roads in the bay area unless we do something\nWell here's Ronald says just want to point out the congestion in cities is not new in New York City after World War two there was a huge amount of traffic caused by unlimited numbers of taxi cabs a taxi medallions system was set up in response to this problem um\nWe talk about tax season is a whole picture that we're giving you about these two reports let's find out what our listeners want to say are asking Susan we begin with you good morning\nI get more without ...

I think there's been a widespread understanding\nIn part because his Joe mention there was a pretty comprehensive report that the transportation authority put out last year about the volume of of a ride service traffic\nBut I I think most of the reaction is is is curiosity and in terms of um what needs to be done and this gets to what the companies need to do I mean this ... in a sense is really all about data\nIt's been very hard for city\nAll about data it's been very hard for city officials anywhere in California to find out exactly what the companies are doing in their own jurisdictions because the state the California public utilities commission regulate these companies in cities can't so\nI'm One hope is that when this per ride tax goes into effect which would be in twenty twenty\nAfter a vote in twenty Nineteen if all that happens then the companies would be operating on a basis where they would need to provide\nA very detailed or at least much more detailed information about what they're doing so I think there's a what was expressed the other day\nOr in the board meeting was a real hunger for that to happen sooner rather than later and then as I said ah maybe consideration of some stronger steps to to limit traffic activity in the most crowded parts of the city so that's\nA south of markets the financial district and then districts five supervisor of district five which stretches from\nThe civic center area out through a haze valley to um\nTo the panhandle area so those are some of the things that folks are saying how much of a difference these tax you makes you think\nYou know the the funds from the taxes are supposed to go to ... transportation projects a San Francisco has a tremendous like almost every jurisdiction has a tremendous unfunded transportation need is something like\nAnd I'm [laughter] it's it sounds fantastic but twenty two billion dollars over the next Thirty years say and I'm ... so this will help in funding but of course it's not the the complete solution there you know we're going to see more requests\nIn the form of votes on taxes for transportation funding infrastructure funding in the years they had a job you wanted to add something here\nWell I just wanted to say that one of the you know this report is silent in terms of making specific policy\nPrescriptions recommendations but I'm providing that kind of policy advisory role is something that the transportation authority does and we will be supporting our board as they are evaluated look at the options around the attacks\nOr you know I think there's Dan mentioned earlier next week we're going to be going back to our board again to talk about some of these options are with respect to congestion management well we have been looking at some pricing strategies\nAre specifically around Treasure Island a freeway corridors I'll but at this point there's an active work look you've got a kind of downtown gesture that's something that a court for direct shot\nThen again joke actually own is deputy director for technology a data and analysis with the San Francisco county transportation authority and get some more callers on let's go to you have snakes for waiting joins\nHey my question is why I felt bad that chronic we had an article where I stand for much care\nAnd I tell him I looked up to the areas to city New York it's five times four times a night [noise] and by the way I guess got back from New York and she really find their [noise]\nOf course much harsher weather can deal with the free on the phone and all that stuff I get down and they can't [noise]\nHelping some light here dead racking you know I'm not familiar with the statistics that you're you're citing I'm ... I'm going to go and read that as soon as we're off the air but\nUm you know there as we've been saying there's been sort of a chronic ... well we mentioned this other report about pavement conditions\nAnd one thing I Will note is that the number of\nPoor roads in the bay area is said to be Seventy one percent that number really hasn't changed in recent years a couple of years ago the last time this report came out it was about the same and it's always been\nA pretty high there's been some movement in in other places Los Angeles um\nThings have actually gotten a little better Los Angeles used to have the worst roads they're they're a percentage of poor roads has gone down\nI mean what you say about weather and everything is is absolutely true I mean it would seem like we've got ... except for the winter rains I mean uh you know we've got pretty good luck climate conditions to hold on to keep pavement\nA whole but you know there are other factors just like the volume of traffic that uh that that do tear it apart I and so I'm Sorry I Can't really give you\nA satisfactory answer about the why uh people have noted though I'll say this one last thing that lots of construction projects especially transportation construction projects really do cost a lot and California and they pointed to things like\nYou know our environmental laws and other kinds of ah you know ah ah administrative review that slow things down and make them a more expensive [noise] um that's certainly not a complete answer but it may be a part of what's going on\nThere's been is ever going to be [laughter] not an under ...\nThese things will be will be finished I mean it takes a really long time uh for some of this stuff to to happen and\nAnd that's a big complaint people have why does it take so long you know in Oakland east Oakland uh AC Transit is in the middle of a really long a project it's similar to van ness are turning it into a bus rapid transit route essentially and\nYou know is taking you\nWere using a transit and San Francisco does have a transit first policy in terms of its transportation a development\nLet me go to more your cause so me being alone in next to London joined us\n[noise] hey hey thank you for taking my call\n'em my question is actually ... the gas tax credit downgrade in your grammar ... a big reason people put forward to vote for that is the bad roads and I'm Wondering how much of that gas tax actually goes to local roads\nYou know I Can't give you a percentage but I'm the what this tax was designed to do is going to be in force were designed to be enforced for ten years it's going to raise you know a\nPox or give me down but there is a debate on that day we featured in our election coverage is in our archives and you can go right to it [laughter]\nOh yeah and and so the it's designed to raise about fifty billion dollars\nAnd the bulk of that money is to go for a larger you know inner city roads or ... you know bridge projects there are some local streets in it but the bulk of the money is is really going to a major arteries and in highways and a lot of that work has already started but um\nYou know ... we're in a situation is I was saying before where there is a continuing unfunded need for local roads and we all\nYou know if you drive especially but even if you ride the bus I mean you know places or bicycle especially you know places where the the pavement is rotten and it stays rotten for a long time with that with maybe just a band aid kind of fix and um\nYou know the gas tax by itself unfortunately is not going to a six on that there is Chris Chris you're on good morning Chris\nHow are you there and I am Michael Pack on two quick\nComments if you go to London as a comparison I don't know who's fixing our roads are the qualities pavement\nIs a real question and how those contracts are done done and then related to stop the market [noise] I think one of the biggest issues is\nOne hundred percent Twitter were able to come down with the help of mirror at least the change the payroll tax to bring in climates that part of the city public transportation never caught up in your ... your only way to get there so I'll take my comment off the dark\nSide I think he will come and do you want to come in and they don't\nGet a ... yeah I just wanted to wait a little bit it's anticipated that\nOf the sixty million I'm a year that's expected for San Francisco about thirty million of that is going to be devoted to ah rode and rode repair the road repair and enter the callers call it the other half to arts funding transit\nAnd here's a coming from a listener named Patrick a like to hear what you have to say Joe ... who took me twenty minutes across marketed seven street

begin with those comments a Paul what what did the president said exactly\nWell he uh he was in a cabinet meeting with\nA with a lot of other cabinet officials and Sonny Perdue who's the head of the U.S department of agriculture which oversees the forest service or we think some comments about a fourth and and uh how they're in good hands now\nAnd he said a Trump said quote California is a mess sets a disgraceful thing old trees are sitting there rotting and dry and instead of cleaning them up they don't touch them they leave them and we ended up with these massive fires\nAnd then he said to I Want to say to the governor you better get your act together uh those people don't want to clean up there for us because they have environmental problems and cleaning it up a you're going to lose your forest you're going to lose it and then he threatened to cut off\nFederal aid to California if the state and do more um he didn't make it clear what that meant whether it's talking about\nFirefighting or money that the federal government through the forest service spends a he said it was quote hundreds of billions of dollars that's incorrect it's actually about three billion dollars was a total firefighting costs in California last year\nOr or whether he was talking about FEMA money you know after towns burned down in federal aid comes in and helped it was all sort of a very vague\nAny idea what prompted him to say that\nWell you know it it's a it's a good question um [noise] he has made a number of statements about forest fires in California that have been um ... frankly completely\nWrong or as as you'll remember he denied that the state was in a drought\nUh when we were in a drought when he was running for office first\nUm he said a couple of months ago that the reason the state was having a hard time with forest fires was because we uh let all of our water run to the ocean\nWhich immediately the Cal Fire officials fighting the fires that no that's not true we have plenty of water you're confusing some of our long running battles with the delta and farmers over a forest fire suppression\nI think in this case uh some members of the Republican

year ago during a year and a half ago during heavy rain storms\nThe still ways it or they'll damn failed a that's a billion dollar project and the state is hoping that the federal government is going to pay Seventy five percent of the repair costs on that\nThere's a most of the rest of the money and prop three about two hundred million dollars on the ballot in November but you know they really need FEMA to give a seven hundred fifty million so far in these disasters the Trump Administration has come through with the FEMA money and I think uh certainly if the Democrats retake the house a in a couple of weeks\nA Speaker Pelosi is not going to let a California not get paid when it has disasters\nIf she's speaker [laughter] nothing another that's another election and I ... in terms of a matter of sometimes you know President Trump has sort of ah ulterior motives when he makes these kinds of comments\nIs there any suspicion among environmentalist or others that he is somehow laying the groundwork for some kind of policy change in national forests\nWell I think we've already seen a directive come down from the Washington office of the forest service that ... that um you know the national forest need to increase the volume of wood harvested\n'em and you know based on some comments that Trump made earlier this year uh during the the middle of the fire season this summer I'm about increasing I think the quote was forest clearing um you know they're that way that kind of falls in line with this idea that\nYou know ... ... additional logging is really the solution to the problem and ah you know the scientific evidence on that is that\nAdditional ... not a solution for the ending a as a ... a Roger mentioned a horse combined with um I'm prescribed burning it's really the the what\nWe're seeing as a as the two tools available the modified or the risk that we\nFace and you know four spinning a generally focuses on those smaller diameter tree and but really the trick is getting\nFired circus fire back into the ecosystems are and that's a central a tool to really modifying how wildfires will interact with the vegetation\nPaul Rogers would you add anything to that in terms of things that environmentalist might be concerned about\nI I Would because it's a really important point because a lot of it says about economics and I'm most scientists will will say what matches said which is to reduce\nHave to as the two tools available to modify the risk that we face\nAnd you know four spinning a generally focuses on the smaller diameter tree and but really the trick is getting fired circus fire back into the ecosystems\nAre and that's a central a tool to really modifying how wildfires will interact with the vegetation\nPaul Rogers would you add anything to that in terms of things that environmentalist might be concerned about\nYeah I I Would because it's a really important point because a lot of it says about economics and\nI'm most scientists will will say what matches said which is to reduce fire rescue do need to thin out some of these ladder fuels the scenario spindly or a ... you know it was a small trees and shrubs the problem is I mentioned earlier as they have almost no market value\nAnd timber companies don't want them because you can't make board that you can sort of make a chip board and things like that but it's not like getting a big green tree\nSo the the timber companies want to cut the bigger green trees to help pay the cost to than other places because otherwise they lose money it costs thousands of dollars and acre to see in a forest and just take out all of the little low market value stuff\nAnd environmentalist and most scientists want the big trees to be kept there\nAnd so that's really the quandary so when folks like Tom McClintock the congressmen from from this era say we need to relax the environmental rules a lot of what he's talking about is we need to be able to cut more big green trees\nEnvironmentalist and some of the scientists will push back and said that actually does not reduce the fire risk it's an economic issue and when you start to do the math on how many millions of acres need to be thin it's billions of dollars that somebody has to pay for it and you're either going to pay for it by allowing more big green valuable tree has to be cut\nFor the federal government state government is going to have to subsidize it\nAll right let's go to the phones now Kevin in Concord welcome\nHey good morning everyone can you hear me okay yeah go right ahead\n[noise] ah well I wanted to ask the panelists if they've heard about holistic management outlined by Allan Savory and using Dan [noise] herds of livestock\nTo reduce carbon in Oakland savannah all the types of terrain we have here in California\nMe as Paul Rogers that well\nIt's a question better for them but yes I have heard of it the idea is that if you grazed areas down you reduce the grasses you you recreate sort of in the native ah grazing regimes that were there\nAnd that you um you know or don't have as much to burn so you keep your keep uh the fire risk down we're seeing that and a lot of parks around the bay area they bring in a grazing animals to reduce the grass is some environmental groups have problems with that because of grazing isn't done properly the animals can get\nDown into the streams and then they start to kill fish and they cause other problems so that's my my general take on the mess or knows more than ...\nMatter do anything to add a male\nOkay here's a question from Nathan and writes the forest did perfectly fine before humans intervened the cycle of the forest depends on the debris from dead trees to restore nutrients how's animal then yes provide fodder for fires fires are tragic from a human perspective they need to happen\nUm would you agree with that man I mean it seemed like fires are one thing but wildfires burning out of control or something else again\nWell in that part of that part of the problem with with uh that question is it it um it ignores the fact that you know there were extensive Native American populations modifying a forested environments and other environments in California\nOn before European settlers arrived and they use fire management tool\nUm you know the the a wildfire in a in a minute what we call them managed fire or prescribe fire chief completely different things and and I think that um in order to to combat some of the economic challenges we're facing that Paul raised ... ... acres that need to be treated\nUh we need to leverage a natural and managed ignition or to treat more of those acres so basically we need to allow fires to burn when the weather conditions are pretty benign so low we low temperatures more moisture in the vegetation\nAnd then we can do a lot of the work fire will do a lot of the work that needs to be done um and and really jumpstart because the ecological prophecy that lead to more healthy forest conditions that also carry a lower risk of these really large wildfires\nAll right I'm going to go to one more call and Rob we're very short on time Rob in San Francisco but if you could maybe freeze your question quickly we'll see if we can get to it\nReally okay um yeah we're private landowner up in the stance on national forest and it was kind of struck by the difference between\nHow the federal government manage their poverty versus the way they'll even pay for private landowners to have extra money to do improvements like this thing we've had a federal money that we qualified for through our private forest or\nUm that's like a subsidy to help us too thin our own place to\nGet to a fire you know putting down but the federal government doesn't even do it to their own property we watch swaths of federal forests that goes on touch while they're providing money for us to do it ourselves which I think is ...\nRob thanks for that comment a matter of a really quick response that if any\nYeah I think they're just the the funding mechanisms are different for state and private or a straight through the forest service then and then the management of the actual for the show you\nAre right well thanks to both of you met her to go see a professor at the department of biology at the University of New Mexico thanks so much for joining us also Paul Rogers managing editor of cake science unit and environment writer for the Mercury News Paul makes so much thank you\nScience unit and environment writer for the Mercury News Paul thanks so much they can\nAll right we're going to take a short break and then when we come back we're going to be talking about proposition twelve [noise] one of the more interesting I'd say a ballot measures in November has to do with the confinement of farm animals will be hearing both sides of that issue so stick around [noise]\n\n\nIs the largest user in the largest egg producer in California is going to be doubling they've already hit with confined about two hundred or excuse me two million to three million hands in a new facility right outside of Bakersfield\nThey're waiting for the passage of prop twelve so they can\nTriple that amount they are going to literally double the number of confined hands in the state of California that is why they're supporting proposition twelve\nAnd the legislature has already said that they are going to a men's is so from Josh right now to say that is a good thing that the legislature couldn't man when there's already legislation that has passed the assembly that will be re introduced as soon as prop too if excuse me if prop twelve passes\nAs soon as that legislature comes back into session they're\nGoing to be changing as they are going to be pushing the date back these are ever changing never arriving deadlines and one more thing the state of Michigan this was happening as well in two thousand and ten Michigan passed supposedly a cage free law\nThey said it would they be outta cages in ten years here it is now in two thousand and Eighteen they're now passing another amendment to that to kick it all the way to two thousand and twenty five this is a pattern that's happening nationally these birds are never going to be out in cages at this\nThan that it's happening nationally these birds are never going to be out in cages at this rate Josh I'm going to\nGive you a chance to respond to a second but I went over the phone lines I think this is what we call a talker\nA people want to talk about this so give us a call at eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six if you want to chime in here one way or the other eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six you can also email your thoughts the forum at ... dot org you can also tweet us we're at ...\nForum yeah ... you brought their very good point about hey where's animal agribusiness on this measure will guess what they're United against proposition twelve the national trade associations\nAnd the weather's the national association of egg farmers\nWere the national poor producers council both against prop but they haven't put money into what have they have they will not yet they haven't particularly waste that\nTime is it likely they do two weeks before but it will be played all the ... we started voting two weeks ago when I was shame on them for for doing that but I'm happy about it but the fact is new it typically what I'm doing debates it's against the agri business when I'm doing the may one day they had in fact Mr Mr replay stuffing or up into that something you typically do please stop interrupting my friend\nSo when we look at N. Y. agribusiness to California egg industry as opposed to it\nThey just had an op ed yesterday and the Mercury News asking people to vote against it\nThe California pork industry is against it and so when you look at who is against it the trade associations of industrial agriculture is against it if you look use for it gets to support the Sierra Club is for proposition twelve natural resources Defense Council is Fort proposition twelve\nCenter for food safety the leading food safety organization in the nation is for proposition ... because when you can find animals in small cages not only do they get sick they get disease and that leads to salmonella leading food safety environmental organizations and I'm animal welfare organizations all encouraged a yes vote including the San Francisco SPCA rebel or\nYou know how can you say they all do when I'm here representing California's against cruelty cages and fraud it's not I do is that how long has that organization that's a ballot measure committed to oppose this\nBut how long has that organization you know\nIs Jolie since prop to this is directed towards proposition twelve excuse me the main farming association has been working on these issues for over Thirty years\nPeople the ethical treatment of animals they've never opposed a ballot measure before for this one they oppose friends of animals opposes there's a variety of groups on each side so we could waste of listeners time just reading list but here's the facts\nIf proposition twelve passes the egg industry is going to double the number of factory farm hands in California they're going to restrict them to one square foot each and it allows the crating of baby calf in California\nThat will continue they put an exemption to allow the dairy industry and anyone raising what's called baby beef to keep those animals in crates here in California while pretending to regulate those outlets\nThat remember Josh when a prop too was on about that the egg industry and others said this is going to kill the egg industry\nYou're right they they are and if there's an economic apocalypse if prop to pass what happened well if there are certainly wasn't one\nOf what happened is that companies actually did go ... many of them did many of them are in the middle of going cage free in fact he called the national shift to move in a cage free direction now yes or a farms coming here and opening up the treatment somebody's that's the direction we want them to go\nYeah we're we're not looking for you to be here voters are so smart they understand that you can't pass the bill and eliminate all suffering in the world is moving animals out of cages and to cage free given purchase dust bathing areas and keep in mind mother pigs confined in a crate where they can't turn around their entire life\nThese are animals as smart as dogs and yet tortured in these cages that still goes on that show on in California please please stop interrupting let's please be civil ... not just the zone admonished somebody's trying to get I'll tell you why if\nIf you got if you're talking over each other everyone's going to turn off the radio so uh\nI agree ... percent that thank you so much and so what is happening is a pork sold in California comes from industrial factory farms that confined mother pigs in cages of the candy been turned around that is cruel inhumane to vote yes on prop twelve that will stop\nThere are no just stationed crates in California there have been for more than ten years there are no veal crates in California there haven't been for decades there are baby cast in crates\nThey are allowing that to continue in California which is a real problem for farm animals while pretending to regulate other states that will never go into effect it is not utopian\nTo hold the position that farm animals that laying hens deserve more than one square foot it is not utopian to say that the vote of California should be upheld that you should not after California voted to have them out a cages by two thousand or Fifteen that you don't make them legal\nInto two thousand twenty two two thousand and twenty four and allows the legislature to kick that further as they are doing in other states\nThis is supported by United egg producers and the major companies that the United states that are part of the Central Valley eggs why is that a bad thing it's a bad thing because those are concentrated animal feeding operations\nThat are extremely cruel these have horrible environmental records horrible animal welfare at ... effort or records is made up of rose acre farm Weaver brothers\nHick men's open foods these are the big players in the egg industry that are waiting for this ... what should be done is we reaffirm\nCalifornia's ban on cages that should have gone into effect in two thousand and Fifteen there were problems with the language yesterday I changed that without a ballot measure uh well we ... we can change it with a ballot measure that isn't a rotten egg initiative\nThat they Farm Bureau just yesterday came out with a statement that said the reason why we are not spending a dime against proposition twelve is because we are going to defeated in the courts were gonna defeated in Congress and\nCalifornians will approve a farm animal measure so what we're saying is there any measure that we put it\nAnimal measure so what we're saying is is it any measure that we put in that actually bans cages and gives them more than one square foot we'll pass I Do\nWant to get to the calls but just quickly Josh and what about that point that the you know there are lawsuits about this whole notion of restricting you know interstate commerce and you know so that so it is true it's not that there will be legal challenges\nEvery single confinement law ever passed the United states had been upheld every single one\nThis is going to be a federal court in ... they had been upheld there's got to think that they serve everyone if fleas stuff interesting every single lawsuit has been has been filed against it has been um ruled out ... ... they're very quick point since I got interrupted here\nIf you look at passing laws for animals we can't constantly live in fear but agribusiness suing to try to overturn laws that help animals that leads to stagnation and doing nothing\nJust quickly are you saying there's a specific\nDay before the court if they haven't taken it up no ... it's they're waiting there's federal ... though the ... the Supreme Court is that there is an active federal lawsuit\nFiled by the attorney general's of Thirteen states there is active federal legislation that targets this very thing and I want to say that under prop twelve\nCentral Valley eggs that will be producing millions of hands in ... in in the so called cage free which is actually one big cage the eggs produce they're under one square foot standard\nWill violate the anti cruelty law Massachusetts they will not be able to sell their eggs in Massachusetts because Massachusetts demands that they get fifty percent more than\nThat or I Want to bring some uh some listeners in on let's go to Alice in San Francisco you're on\nThe high it's just I have a question that project caught up and\nI have a picture that these ... tree where how I mean the poor and gets crammed with hand absolutely inhumane I mean that's what they're calling cage free housing if it is that horrific\nJosh Josh Hi as a response yup yup so here's here's the status quo\nEgg laying hens can find a barren wire cages imagine their cages size of your microwave six chickens in there that status quo\nCage free mean why does impromptu would fix that will prompt to meets space better when fortunately what happened is that the ... in front of a feeding agriculture\nGave me a guideline that still allowed these animals to be in cages and that was wrong they shouldn't have done it but we shouldn't just sit back and allow that to happen not do something about it which which cage free is is a big step in the right direction where they can perks dust based scratch lay eggs nesting area that is a big step forward if you're

... she is staff writer for the San Francisco chronicle Kimberly welcome to you as well get mornings and Darwin bond Grammys a journalist with ... thanks for coming in\nWhat would give you a chance to sort of weigh in on this but this idea just to give us the big picture of Oakland to sort of what are the issues I just kind of briefly touched on them like what's the\nWhat's the mood over there the voters\nWell Oakland is a city undergoing rapid massive change and it's very visible in terms of the cranes in the sky and the homeless and has population on the street right you can see the fact that the city is changing and cause a lot of anxiety amongst Oakland residents particularly longtime Oakland residents particularly black and\nLatino people of color um so they're definitely feeling like they're city is slipping away from them on the other hand you're seeing a lot more opportunity in Oakland for businesses more jobs or you know more roads getting paved things like that so it definitely is it's a city at a crossroads in many ways and the question is\nWhat the next four years look like and whether or not they're kind of some of the most important for years in Oakland future because they might decide which direction to city goes\nSo you do have this giant slate of candidates eleven totally get off I've kept track 'em and you you have ...\nUm you know has sort of been a presence that many people really appreciate my ... very like she's got a lot of time support 'em in Oakland but you also have some progressive candidates who are in a sense almost writing what you might call the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez wave um the\nWay up to the you know sort of like Social Democrats\nAgainst establishment Democrats right which you could say that this race kind of and bodies in a sense even though from the outside a Libby shaft standing against Trump and and um you know a warning that the ice kind of makes her look like a progressive within Oakland she's actually not that progressive candidate\nMental health resources\nFor the homeless she similarly has sort of a zero tolerance policy she wants to implement on a police officer to engage in misconduct\nSuit you know her focus is really on um police accountability and transparency and bringing in some of them more traditionally a county services to the city\nAnd other no really quickly on price Darwin was talking about the sex scandal and the police department and she first sort of you know bought attention and made a profound known because she represented on the young woman who is sort of a exploited in that scandal so\nShe was sort of the one time attorney there\nAnd some of your uh kept Brooks and Pamela price both African Americans will be live chef courses white how does race play into this race\n[laughter] well I mean I don't think you can escape race in American politics right now and you certainly can't escape race in Oakland when we're talking about uh\nYou know displacement of people were talking about displacement of black and brown people and so when we're talking about the changing of Oakland we're talking about the transformation of Oakland from what was an almost majority black city and the and the eighties to um you know a a a city that has a shrinking population and that is definitely part of black folks going\nSo this this is something I'm particularly interested in but on many uh many black people\nLeaving the state rights and I'm going to Texas and other places but those who are staying with in California are I'm kind of going further and further out for a long time they were going to Antioch 'em and places like that\nAnd now they're going even further out to the Central Valley some are going to Sacramento um there's definitely a sort of a mass exodus of what had been Oakland black population and I think that definitely plays a role I think it also plays a role in terms of the way in which we're talking about the progressive coalition because we've been talking about\nUm more and more women of color running for positions of power for political power in this country and so I think that can be applied to this race as well now Libya shaft definitely seems to have the lead in this race she's got the infrastructure she by far has more money than anyone else\nBut when you put cat Brooks and Pamela price together as a sort of coalition the question is can you get out the vote of young white progressive the Bernie Sanders crowd many of whom support cat Brooks\nAnd that sort of traditional a black voters from the flat land many of whom support Pamela price can you bring those two together and create a coalition that strong enough to take on a Libby shot who has that sort of establishment a presence\nAnd a darn what about ... I think it's somewhat ... said they were going to open up a headquarters in Oakland they change their mind uh what other big companies you referred to Amazon I think a moment ago uh like what is the I mean certainly in San Francisco tech has taken over the economy a lot of ways\nA as a tech workers are they're they're very prevalent now and the culture and the\n... and just sort of a discussion around what's happening in San Francisco to what extent is that true in Oakland\nIs true to some extent but yeah ...\nIs that true in Oakland\nIs to some extent but yeah ... famously um fought the Sears building and then sold it probably for profit\nAnd they're not moving there now but um there are actually tech companies and other very like high end you know like white ... you know law firms um biotech companies that are in Oakland and that are moving their um\nThat sector of the economy is growing and it's employment in the city\nA believer in Oakland also remains very much an industrial city\nAnd this is actually something that previous city councils and mayors have been very successful at doing which is maintaining the port of Oakland and the waterfront as a working waterfront so that that's going to remain a big employment driver I'm for that for Oakland and for the East Bay for the foreseeable future\nTalking about the Oakland marriage race or Libby chef facing a challenge from ten other candidates our guest this hour ... D also Kimberly ... from the chronicle and Darwin on the ground from the East Bay expressed\nWe haven't talked much about sports so there was an illusion I think to the A's who are trying to find a ballpark or a space to build a ballpark the raiders are leaving for\nVegas some people say good riddance some people are heartbroken the warriors are coming over here to San Francisco how's any or all of that playing out is that is that something you know and who does it who's the benefits\nI think there is a pretty small constituency who places the ballpark as their top issue or even among their top issue in fact that was one of the reasons why mayor shaft was willing to let the raiders go because she knew that voters didn't want a lot of public money going into professional sports stadiums are\nSo right now you have the Oakland is looking for their next ballpark and we were just talking a lot about displacement and gentrification and that was a big reason why they didn't get their first choice by which would have been nearly any college and like merit\nThere was a big community there that you like community it's a lot of immigrants there a lot of Asian Americans not as low income people who are worried that the development that would surround the new ballpark would hike up their rent and not make them have to go somewhere else\nAnd a ... cat Brooks and Pamela price of it what are they saying about the\n... as far as I say it's not really too much on their radar somewhere deep down and I yeah I mean you know sports I think that like one of the things that you that you're pointing out is that you've got\nOftentimes any bells and then when he goes to work to building stadiums that really is a large driver of displacement identification\nAnd so in a sense on that on that side ladies actually done what most progressive would advocate which is to not have ever that money for for for sports teams obviously I think that Oakland will real and the next few years the raiders have left before\n... some people are prepared but with the raiders going at the same time as the warriors and with the warriors going over ... over time Francis Scott I think there'll be there'll be bitterness in the bars but I don't know that it will necessarily go over to the ballot box\nIs there a lot of debate or any debate about what to do with the ... with oracle and with you know the A's a ballpark corridors huge amount of land rags to bart Yeh is an added a lot of housing there yeah\nBut it's also it's also a big problem for the city because I'm finding a developer you can take all that over and competently rebuild\nThis giant slice of land in east Oakland and it's it's what surrounds that land is not particularly appealing to most developers it's very low income neighborhoods that spread it out of the freeway right by the freeway and some like heavy industry and very polluted um areas\nBut does anyone in the if if nothing else it's an opportunity for development to turn it into something with jobs and you know something attractive for businesses\nAs it is it's just extremely difficult to find someone who can come in and has the right skill set and can raise the financing I mean it's it's like a multibillion dollar development project\nIf you go back to elections ago it was done product versus Jean Quan or I'm Sorry versus a Rebecca kept women Jean Quan they sort of teamed up against ...\nAnd a Jean Quan ended up winning in that race choice election Rebecca ... have been kind of a ... another present some city council Sandia and she had been thought to be

just sort of rallied people and maybe you know got got a little more interest in the campaign but it wasn't like he was out there on the trail you know giving speeches and\nStuff and we're coming up on the brakes on dia but just you know in general is this an election that has motivated captivated board people I mean what how would you describe how engaged OLC lenders Oakland or is are you know in this election\nThat depends on which are ... you're talking about and you definitely have you know\nMany people in some of the flat land sea or less engaged at because they have too much to worry

and the mayor who say you know we want more affordable housing by you know look at our ... it's it's ... we have to get some tensions et\nCetera south are we talking about pensions some of them I I mean that's a huge issue I don't really want to talk about [laughter] yeah it's sort of thing on the back burner\nInteresting what's going to move making its way to the front burner let me tell you\nA let's go to the phones again the number eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six and we'd go to Paul in Oakland eyeball\n[noise] get a good morning yeah my comment is I'm a long time resident of Oakland and you know it's kind of ironic but uh when let me ... talks about immigrants and protecting them and yet when you look on her street it's primarily African Americans have been pushed out\nFrom the house thing and just from the overall economic changes and it just it just seems like it doesn't make much sense it there\nI'm In Oakland and it's it's really disturbing um to observe um I think what a\nPaul was trying to say there is that there's a feeling that\nUm the sanctuary yeah the the issue of creating sanctuary for immigrants is being used as a political um this this cynical interpretation is being used as a political proper is people are running against Trump because that's easy and what's up their base\nBut they're not addressing the real needs um that are that ... in Oakland and the city\nAwhile back issued this thing called the equity indicators report and it showed that across the board in every category you can possibly measure\nAfrican Americans are suffering in Oakland more than any other or racial group um housing in security joblessness um affects\nAh in environmental racism which just across the board and the feeling is not there the the needs of the African American community just aren't being met and that image of immigration is being brought up as a as an opportunistic\nIssue that that's what I've observed from ... but ... other people are going to express it differently and it may sound like a something kind of more horrible\nKimberley oh quickly just bringing it back to the mayor's race it's interesting to Oakland chamber of commerce issued as a result of a poll this morning\nAnd it showed that among all races on their shots is leading however when you look specifically at African American voters are actually more split between her and her challenger Pamela price\nUm and when you look to at across all that her she's also waiting but among progressive that's much more competitive as\nWell and that might be a good time to just talk about right to his voting or we'll looted to that earlier with Don brought uh a race a few years ago but ... ... what is your son who should say\nHow rain choice voting worse it's ah you know you get three votes in a sense and you rank your top three candidates one two three and if your top candidate is at the bottom that those books get redistributed\nUm what is your sense on the uh uh if you know is how rank choice voting might play out obviously it worked well against ... or is there some thought that it could also do the same ...\nYeah I think they're absolutely as I mean anything's possible Oakland Oakland as a place that had been known for kind of political craziness in the past and if anything is possible and I do think that\nThe most important thing about rank choice voting other than understanding on is that it can group groups of politicians can team together to take on a set of powerful and and better number ... opponent rights\nSo we know that that's Libby shaft right now but that means and and I think she's pulling as it at thirty seven percent according to the end and the chamber of commerce says recent power but it also means that Pamela price and kept Brooks polling at Seventeen percent\nSo if those numbers come together and bank choice voting that actually creates a kind of almost equal opposition we'll competition\nAlthough it's rarely ups usually it's really easy all of a second votes go to one person\nTo stare at you I mean what it what it does is it makes it very competitive in a way that it might not be without ... studying and so that does give this so called progressive\nCoalition a lot more power\nBut is there an active campaign the way there was with Rebecca Kaplan and a\nJean Quan pet Pamela price is saying if you don't vote for me first or or if you vote for me first pick kept broke through your number two she's actively saying that the other candidates aren't really saying the same thing and you don't you don't quite see that kind of the coalition emerging\nAlright let's go to the phones again again the number eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six and Robert in Emeryville welcome\nYou know you're right I'm a businessman here in Oakland and when they put it right place it just made a trash can of Oakland where\nGene ... came in there and just\nThe whole nightmare so business people and when you get in there and the Oakland these chain I met her\nAnd with all that is open just going down to you and just opening the door for all these high tech people coming in here is taking over everything and open it or repeal coming across borders taking all the money away from our people when they hear like a minority so\nIt it doesn't change here you might as well forget it\nWell let me ask you Robert as a as a business person or is there is some benefit to businesses from having all this economic development\nOh no because the way it is\nA mess because the opening businesses can't stay in business because they have all the barriers to please change and it just wipe out any kind of direction towards the money where does the most the most good if you look at the technical high school and look at the graduate from there there's\nNo future for them because they the it's a mess over there to the students and not being taught but we're leading and so the people with all the money but take it all\nOver the good stuff yeah Kimberly we haven't really talked about the schools in March the mayor doesn't control the schools are but ah you know ... has education and I know there's talk about closing schools a few months ago because of budget cuts and consolidation how how big an issue is that yeah educate yourself\nThe ... the educational thing\nThe big money doesn't go where it's needed them ...\n... okay let's let's have Kimberly way and again\nTo one thing to note that you mentioned it set Oakland Unified School district as an independent governance structure ah but it's you know their budget problems and they are huge we're talking millions of dollars that they're just completely in the rat on eight dollars come in to some city issues I'm the mayor\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solutions celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it in for Mike Rowe dot com\nThe big money doesn't go where it's needed ...\n... okay let's let's have Kimberly way\nAnd again to one thing to note as you mentioned it set Oakland Unified School district as an independent governance structure ah but it's you know their budget problems and they are huge we're talking millions of dollars that\nThey are just completely in the rat on eight dollars come in to some city issues\nI'm the mayor has championed that Oakland promise program which is sort of the cradle to college you know let's make sure our babies have opportunities regardless of their skin color and so it it does affect ah you know see campaigning and\nSuch and saw the Roberts Roberts' point I mean is there a sense that the you know all this economic development just isn't benefiting it's all going to people who are moving into the city the tech workers if people in the in the hills that kind of thing\nYeah that's absolutely a sense that local businesses suffer because you have only the ability for instance with an incredible capital to come in and use that have had the ... take as much as he didn't San Francisco right you know in it it's very much the same way with a loving places kind of close down\nYou know every week it feels like and I think that that whether or not I would have happened anyway cities change right at you know nothing is going to stop season changing there's a real sense of personal often often that's definitely\nAnd I think that I'm watching Oakland changes in really act anxiety producing for a lot of people and it's driving a lot of this conversation but I think it is important to talk about schools and the fact that when you're talking about housing\nPrices increasing you're talking about teachers not being able to afford to live in Oakland anymore\nAnd when when you're talking about how the grants going on here also talking about commercial rents going up at the same\nTime down to ... to the caller's point also um the industries that Oakland is attracting right now either industries that take an incredible amount of education to get a job in and Oakland schools like castle\nMont I'm I'm a climate wins\nUm Freemont high even skyline the the education that the students are getting there is not good it's it's not it's not good right now and they can't get these jobs in the tech sector so people see you know software engineering and um these these very high in positions they can't grasp them\nThen at the at the the lower level jobs these working class jobs don't pay enough to live in the city any more I think that's what the caller is kind of kind of saying there when he's linking you know education and jobs in the sense that um\nBut the is the solution it seems to me would be to improve the schools not tell those kinds of employers go way go somewhere else\nRight but the it to improve the schools is incredibly difficult problem and um you know they've been digging themselves out of state receivership for years now and it it it all you know last year it looked like they might have been headed back there and so All right\nLet's go back to the phones are back to Oakland and Steve welcome\nActually how about you know without talking about training because", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
