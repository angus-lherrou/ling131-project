forum we are coming to you live from the Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa\nIn Santa Rosa was in a housing crisis even before the ... fire demolish thousands of homes last year now rents just sky high vacancy rates are very low and middle of low income people who used to call Santa Rosa home\nAre wondering if there is a place for them Santa Rosa is in desperate need of housing but what kind and where should the city be developing and forest areas that have burned before and they will burn again let me tell you who is joining us for the hour we want to welcome for some Arab Santa Rosa crisscrossing the morning they're good to have you with us\nWe also have a Julie comes with us as a council member on the Santa Rosa city council good morning to you\nAnd we'll say good morning a JD Morris who's also with us here local government reporter for the Santa Rosa press Democrat morning the morning glad to have you and glad that Michael Weinberger here as well who's president of the economic Institute at the bay area council morning Michael morning welcome to all of you and let's begin a if I may mayor of course he with you and I like to begin\nBy just talking about what your sense is well you can get us on board in terms of what we're moving forward in terms of rebuilding but before what about the morale of the city as you see it\nI think that the morale of the city is good um you know after the fires last year we had a tremendous outpouring of of love and support from everyone in in Santa Rosa snowman county bay area around the country really are as you know\nTens of millions of dollars were raised to help folks recover from the fire\nThat feeling is continued throughout the past year or last night in downtown Santa Rosa we had a fairly quiet an observation of the anniversary and you could still feel the same feelings really that uh we felt a year ago\nIt's been somber I Know a year later but at the same time there's a feeling of resiliency of the community moving together and moving forward\nAbsolutely um you know ... it's a tough question just to say how the community is doing because the recovery is is proceeding well on on the global scale you know the numbers are are large of of people who are in the rebuilding process\nBut by ... you know what's what's not reflective is all the people who are still are really starting their own recovery\nAnd I remember asking right after the fire what do you say to people who said you know I'd like to rebuild but I don't want to go through this again it happens fifty four years ago the handling fire or it's going to be cyclical and especially in certain areas it's really very risky\nIt is I'm In California is a risky place to live if if you live in California uh it's likely that you're going to experience a fire or an earthquake or a mudslide or flood\nUm we weigh those risks we'd balance says risks with the the desire to live in a beautiful place and um people who are rebuilding have to make those those decisions\nLet's talk about the rebuilding though America say specifically because there is a Mercury News headline and it said a a coffee park is coalescing I think they use that word coalescing a fountain growth still has a lot to do I mean there there is a kind of a a real comparison contrast between those two communities in terms of progressive\nNatural gas piping into the high fire risk areas in the ... the written wild land urban interface\nUm so that's one of the battle so far we have not been able to move that proposal forward a and that's too bad it it just doesn't make sense to me that we would put natural gas piping into a fire area\nI Know also you've been concerned about homelessness a Santa Rosa let's talk about that with you for a moment Newark and bring the\nUh the others in and I want to go to Michael Weinberger as well and talk about the economic side of development ah but when ... when we're talking about a displacement now we're talking about this place when operating on a number of levels began will be displaced because a landlord wants to reclaim\nA or there'll be displaced because uh the rent is too high I mean there's all kinds of reasons so you're homeless rate as the as far as the populations increase for about six percent yes it has and it's going up it has yes so what are we doing and what can we do\nThat that's really a tough one um that's that's another place where we have created a joint\nA group with the\nCounty um to address homeless issues to create a um planted\nTo combine and more efficiently spend our resources with the county to solve some of our homeless issues we've adopted a housing first model so and um I for one hope that at some point we will establish as safe parking area on city property\nUm that's another one that stuff I reach\nUm we have to have folks have a place to go while we are engaged in the rebuilding process so we need to rebuild we need to produce housing we need to protect tenants and we need to preserve the existing affordability that we have and without doing all three things will continue to have problems\nA lot of News I'm an ... which you have to say about these days I mean Michael Weinberger this prison economic Institute at the bay area council what about development of virus curious from your perspective\nWell I mean I think the first thing I just want to say that the city and county I've done a lot of wonderful things are and of course the the people in the community rebuilding from the fire member block captains that us Roger James Gore has a has been organizing and many many others um but\nWe say a lot of things also to help development to absolutely ... and ... and waving ...\nPutting together GPA and so on and it's not enough\nUm we just did one quick data point\nIt actually is shocking to me Sonoma County out of all the nine barrier counties had the highest rate of families that have housing costs burden so over foreign time families in two thousand Fifteen before the fires happened you would think it would be to look in Bali or San Francisco now where it's right here in Sonoma County\nSo we just need to understand if we say we walk development yes but it has to be X Y Z and it has to be you know this level of uh this area\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream bike has said Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October ninth through November fourth ... Chen or free in theater ... death dot com\nExample homelessness if we do not find a way to build more homes we will build more tense\n\nAre low income fountain garbage in the wild land a short that high income\nAbsolutely but that's how displacement happens\nWhen you don't build housing for people who are higher income they out compete for people who are lower income and it pushes them out at the periphery there are so many people that were sort of you know that cap poster to hang on baby right they were already like just hanging on by their claws\nBefore all of this happened and so they end up being the people who are now a lot of cases no longer living here who have already been displaced who are mega commuters there are people commuting into an out of Sonoma County\nTo and more and more hours each way every day so\nUm I think a lot of wonderful things have been done obviously we need to think carefully about\nUh whether we're going to be building and especially the unincorporated areas of the wild urban interface I think it's a harder question when you're talking inside city limits in areas where they will be building to a higher coach standard\nWell there's been a lot that's been done there's a whole suite of uh of rules allowing people to live in our lease for example and these tiny houses that have a\nAn occupied I'm granny units are and so forth so there's guest houses and things of that sort of I mean there's lots of ... or as you suggested a lot in many ways at the city has done and move forward on that really needs to be it seems to me highlighted but\nYou've got all these people who are out of any kind of a roof over their head you've got a serious crisis on your hands and what to do about that particularly in light of the fact that developers well in fact what are you one of those what are your concerns I think is environmental regulations still endangered species act isn't it\nYeah well I mean any one of these concerns um and they're all important you know salamanders are important every but humans are also important and at some point we need to say\nAre all of the regulations that we have every one of which is cherish\nPrecious way by very large an organized group if everybody continues to get their way on those things were going to continue to get the outcomes that we've gotten and so we need to understand how are we going to balance these competing priorities around resilience and around inclusion\nSo I Will say I think that the majority of the city council made the right\nDecision in the development and fountain grove I think that was a good ...\nI understand the other competing consideration but I think that was probably the right call\nThis is a pretty delicate balance we're talking about earlier crisscross he I mean how do you get through this you\nGot so many vested interests here and people want well can't have it all\nThree there absolutely are many vested interests and you know the the the people who live in the community now or get to have a say in in what happens to the community and the future um as far as the regulations and the the environmental constraints\nI just I Need to say that ... has a plan um has the inventory of of land available has the zoning in place\nTo build the five thousand homes that we think we need 'em that plan is is that of those five thousand half of them twenty five hundred will be available to people who make less than the median income [noise]\nUm the the important thing that we need to do is provide the resource to create those homes for less than than market rate\nAnd that uh that's what we're trying to do with measure in a November sixth that are pretty easy things of this I mean to put as it is a tricky thing to do because we need two thirds a positive vote on it and two thirds of any kind of a tax measure is is a tough bar to cross\nUm I've actually been involved in campaigns that have done that in the past though and I'm and I'm thinking that the the voters of Santa Rosa\nCare about their neighbors their kids um their friends their co workers the future I'm a workers of this city and that they will vote yes on November ...\nAll one piece of good news Micah Weinberg is the market is starting to suffer the bit while\nI mean that's good news and bad news right I mean it's good news for affordability is potentially bad news for new developments getting talked about some of these issues are good news bad they are\nUm by the way it is really good I'm I'm excited about a measure on them excited about the prospect of the use of taxing increment financing cities lost a lot of their uh ability to really be\nOf help with these projects from redevelopment went away as possible something like that would come back in the Newseum administration performed in some way so there are lots of things that can be done to get more affordable housing and Santa residents are doing a lot of them\nWere coming up on those are you in the audience if you'd like to be recognized to ask a question please raise your hand we will find you\nA we do want your input and this and do want to hear from you your thoughts are

areas I'm asked my my colleague the mayor mentioned we've dropped significantly dropped impact fees are in our downtown we've cut water who cut costs in half\nUm and we have come to the public asking for measure and that in his neighbor I'm so that we can get a housing bond on that one hundred and twenty four million dollars thirty cents a person a day\nWould go massively to stimulating the construction in our downtown to getting that taller buildings and all of it is for Ford ability so I I mean I think there is I'm not a lot more that a small town well I shouldn't say small town where the fifth largest in the\nTown to town where the fifth largest in the bay area but there's not a lot that his city can do with out back out from the state and federal government and and I'm One of the things I'm doing is working regionally with the committee to has the bay area it's a nine bay area consortium blue ribbon panel\nTo work with the legislature on creating the kinds of change that we need to see so we can implement housing here\nOh good luck with that we're going to go to the audience now in a welcome to the morning\n[noise]\nThese one measure I realize that the state has passed a law that allows um extra house on every law just about in the state and I wonder how that is being helped by measure in and I'm also wondering if someone knows how it's being dealt with throughout the bay area maybe make a nose\nYeah these are the and this is just the bay area council sponsored a couple of people pieces of this legislation I every time I say accessories dwelling unit a colleague gets their wings 'em by\nYou know I think the the interesting thing about access redrawing units as they are gentle density so there are lots of different you know you can go up in three dimensions or you can have these houses are on your property and I think it's a very important part of the the housing conversation it's not the only part of the housing conversation\nOften they are not eligible for a lot of the other financing mechanisms around affordability so actually in some of the consulting work that we've been doing with the public officials we've been wondering whether we could do more to create these units that are sort of affordable by design by their nature\nYou know what I'm struck by the facts and let me go back to your mayor of course the on this we haven't even discuss the zoning codes are because those have to come under scrutiny what's happening on that front\nUm before I answer that question that the second part of the question was how measure and might affect eighty years or or ... grand a year and it's\nAnd a measure in a requires at ... at least Seventy five percent of of the proceeds go to creating affordable rental housing for people who make less than the median family income\nBut up to twenty five percent of it can be used for uh people who qualified for on the affordability of the the income level\nOr for um assistance for um eighty you construction\nA for first time homebuyers downpayment assistance or for fire survivors who are able to to um uh fill all the unmet needs that they have but again this was for\nPeople who are um are qualifying under the affordability restrictions\nAnd now if you would zoning codes and rebuilding I mean we're around that\nOurs ours owning codes have have not been changed on any broad level for quite a while we're going to be looking at our general plan within the next couple of years but you know as I said before we have zoning in place to meet the needs a for housing in the city\nAnd here's Carol Lewis and Michael you on this can you ask your guest about the high cost of rebuilding costs of materials have skyrocketed and signing contractors as difficult folks are leaving because they can't afford to rebuild\nIts about what by the way about six percent a matter of course you know in terms of it as far as people leave there I I don't know the case of like a vigorous Democrat at a recent analysis\nThat said I'm about seven thousand people which is much less than six percent\nI don't know what I that figure was reached through a ... a an analysis that I'm not sure holds up with with real good scrutiny\nBut we don't have the data to really know what the numbers are I Know a lot of anecdotal stories are people I Know of have left town uh but we don't know what the number\nI think that the first Democrat said that seven thousand was for people who actually left the county or was it was so\nFirst of all I mean the problem is there hasn't been an official estimate of that which there really needs to be I think that's information will be a hard day everybody would like to have so that was part of the difficulty in arriving at that number but seven thousand um I Believe\nAnd it was my colleague Martin and that's been those who did that story but I think it was that was the number of people that left Santa Rosa\nLot of those people actually just went somewhere else in the county and we found that at least I think it was Thirteen hundred left the county has already goes I saw um yeah but it it could have been higher I mean that would not surprise me\nI Want to speak quickly to the question on the cost of materials we've been talking about some very difficult tradeoffs but there are some issues that are easy we should not be in a tariff base to trade war that is dramatically raising the\nOf fuel for building some of these high density development that actually is not a difference\nThe development that actually is not a difficult question\nBut we have a question for the audience or at least to come and go back to the audience this is Catherine\nI'm kind of tangential to what we've been speaking about the community of Santa Rosa and I think the greatest thing in my\nCounty area was very moved by the response of people opening up their hearts in their checkbooks and enormous amounts of money we're raised and yet we hear about people leaving the city leaving the county people\nHaving to commute two hours to find work to get to their work\nAnd um it just the discrepancies in their insurance and so has there been a careful accounting of all this money it was raised as it making it to the people that need it\nHow about monitoring let me go to you on the city [noise]\nUm yeah I mean we've done a story about that um you know how that money or being you know distributed I'm Sorry I I think to some extent there has but there are to probably be a lot more um you know there was a lot of money\nRaised definitely including through our um north bay federally funded the customer crowded with um redwood credit union and Mike McGuire office but I didn't need is a lot higher than that and it may have looked like a\nYou know are really splashy dollar figure I forgot what it was at the end of the day but there's always going to be a bigger need the housing costs here are just so high um\nThe market is so tough that you know that generosity I'm really needs to um keep coming is what people are telling me the folks that I talked to so I didn't want to add\nTo the you know I've I've seen and heard discussion about what the city or the county has done with all the money that was donated a after the fires\nCity in the ... county did not receive those donations they were made to to private entities to philanthropic organizations I I Know that those organizations of of distributed that money but it's not for the city and county to\nTo audit um so uh I don't have those answers\nYou have any idea though how much are the nonprofit sector has stepped up and even a rough figure I Know it's in the tens of millions of dollars I think it's around fifty or sixty million dollars to us as extraordinary and uh\nCertainly it'll people very grateful let me go back to the homeless population or if I may was usually combs because you've got people who are really vulnerable and you also have undocumented workers who haven't been able to find housing and who are not eligible for federal is an exactly right so what's being done we can do\nWe were lucky to have a group step up called an ... fund and they

C. uh I guess the place to begin here is what the major takeaway from this is and I think\nIt can be summed up in if you prevent a single degree and the earth's climate it could mean life or death for millions of people and ecosystems\nThat's right the authors in a press conference announcing the report made the point that every degree matters and EPA warmer it gets the worse it gets now that might seem like an obvious point but you know scientists like to test their assumptions and that's what they did here and pulling more than six thousand papers and they found that yeah these\nSmall bits of warming have major consequences\nAnd we should mention this is the global scientific\nAuthority on climate change a it's an extension of the work was done by a not only in Paris but by the United nations previously won the Nobel Prize we have a hundred and thirty two authors we have a drawing on about six thousand peer review research papers and the news is not good it's a I think a fair to say pretty grim\nThat's right ah one thing they do emphasizes that we're already seeing effect of climate change now since pre industrial times with a plan of average temperature has already gone up by one degree Celsius there as adults\nAnd we're seeing the effect of that in terms of the whole ride in terms of um more heat waves and solemn exacerbated extreme weather events and that point they were making is that it will continue to get worse by that we can limit we can take actions now to start limiting some of the worst case scenarios\nYeah we're talking again with the mayor of San and he is a staff writer recovers climate change for vox uh we're we're in pretty bad shape now by any standards and we need to cut according to the report by about a half or the emissions\nBefore we get to twenty thirty and go carbon neutral by twenty fifty I mean they seem like big reaches to put it mildly\nThat's right these are some pretty aggressive changes about forty five percent productions of

think about as low carbon you know switching to bring your energy becoming more energy efficient and limiting our own you know energy consumption over all but it also calls for some new tactics like carbon dioxide ...\nAnd that's where you use a variety of different technologies or strategies to pull the oh to back out of the air\nYou'll electrify everything that you can so you use that clean

the most natural ways to carbon capture as not these complex geoengineering\nIt's actually to invest in ways to preserve and to make forests more healthy because that's eight and read all the way to to do carbon capture it's the one we know how to do immediately at very low cost her benefit\nAnd then also to think about much much smarter agriculture so that our inputs are dramatically lower energy outputs are higher\nAnd these are always that we can do\nBiological carbon capture right away and they're wonderful compliments to the green energy strategy and that's why this report is not all bad news but thankfully it's really gotten public attention because of the bad news\nAnd we should mention that carbon capture is essentially the removal of carbon from the atmosphere that's supposed to preventing it's a mission in the first place and let me go to Rachel ... and Dan Kammen is professor of energy and directs the renewable and appropriate energy laboratory at UC Berkeley

you know who did an extraordinary amount of planning a gun in Africa I mean it does make a difference\nIt makes a huge difference to midway men as exactly on target um but I worked with one guarding massage in Kenya for a quite a while before she passed away and her effort was focused on a women and their critical role in managing the landscape be small individual agricultural plots or the forests around homes\nAnd so that Green Belt movement was designed to\nReally utilize the the critical ruled that women playing so many places as stewards of the land\nThis argument about tree planting is absolutely right on and I mentioned it I'm In the opening part of the show where one of the geoengineering I'm very soft version of geoengineering is re investing as far as the at preserving forests the Amazon the Congo basin Southeast Asia\nThe tundra but also the screening of our built environment and so planting trees in urban areas\nOf our built environment and so planting trees in urban areas rebuilding I'm the health of forests through investing and planting trees irrigation has a very large effect and actually that's the version of\nThis going carbon negative that's something that one can begin right away in a completely no regrets way and if it fits in critically\nBecause the past that we're going to need to make this deep carbon is Asian happened this eighty or Ninety percent reduction emissions we're going to need everything we can do and because this one does not require advanced planning it's not a technology base that we haven't\nPerfected yet it is a critical part of the story and of course it leads to one of the other big benefits and that is\nWe have an equally large problem with water availability in places like California but also for the poor around the world\nAnd rebuilding ecosystems is the best way to secure water supplies and in fact the decide BCC a report\nReally highlighted the horrific numbers that fresh water availability may fall dramatically as much as a fifty percent drop in the Mediterranean already the poor live without adequate supplies of fresh water leads to these this is part of this feedback loop and these are very\nAvailable and immediate ways to make a social justice environmental economic and health impact and that saves us far more than the cost of these programs so it's a huge opportunity\nWe go to a couple of comments are that are coming in and again Dan Kammen is professor of energy and direction renewable and appropriate Energy Lab at UC Berkeley\nAnd has been a lead author for the BCC um this is a listener named Holly who says I'll go to you and this Dan Kammen a friend with no knowledge of climate science asked me how scientists calculated what will happen at higher temperatures police had Dan give a simple explanation for such a listeners who don't believe that inclusions well\nIt certainly sad to hear that there are people who don't believe although we certainly know there are because we have so much data and there's really two ways that this gets done in the one way I'm is uh making inferences from observations so as we see storms like I'm\nFlorence and now Michael taking the coast we look at the cost of these we\nStart we used to know how ... infrequent they were they are becoming more and more frequent but we look at the damage from events that happened heat waves in Australia in Bangladesh and California droughts and we look at those and then we use that to make an appearance polar a bottom up an assessment of\nHow much climate change we're going to see how much damage from a given temperature rise but the other way we do it is to work top down and to use global climate models which would be getting better and better over the past decades and fighter and finer resolution and we go from both ways use the models to predict\nHow much temperature impact will see how much change in precipitation\nHow much change in river flow and then we use these events that are more and more extreme in fact many of these storms that we see we used to think we're one in a hundred or even one in five hundred year events now we're getting several a year and so these extreme storms\nThat sadly give us lots of data on how bad the damages are to agriculture to coast lines to um impacts in water availability and\nWhen the observations are one thing but you know you do hear a lot of the climate skeptics and climate deniers say computer models are now they don't really necessarily filled a bill or they just\nGet your rights funny you say that of course because the models or we used to project long in the future but we don't even need these models to know there's an incredibly important data series that NASA puts on its website there's no model involved at all and it's simply is a picture of the north pole\nTaken us throughout the course of the year ... plays as a movie and you can see that the amount of polar sea ice\nHas declined by over fifty percent in the last several decades\nWe have similar observational a record using satellites that observes that we used to think of the Amazon for example is the lungs of the planet that absorbing huge amounts of\nCarbon dioxide which is good but with the inroads in the Amazon in Southeast Asia and Borneo in the Congo we see areas that used to be sinks or absorbing carbon dioxide now more a source and so we have these data records that don't involve models at all\nAnd really the mixture of ease is what convinced the entire scientific community even skeptics a well more than a decade ago that you might quibble with who was causing it or what are the best strategy is to address it but the science of climate change is now very very well established\nLet me go back to Rachel clear just to you as a question from a listener named Ryan and we actually covered on for on the fact that ah [noise]\nThe business ration has essentially pulled back on regulations of methane and Ryan writes a police escort is being done regarding the fact that leaked and under a natural gas methane is twenty seven times more damaging as a greenhouse gas than burn carbon I work with the department of environment

mean we must have already thinking [laughter] when when you look back at ... I mean to my mind nearly all of the transformative social and political movement hum that have reshaped the nation from abolition and suffrage through the labor movement\nThe civil rights movement the gay rights and that meant that women savannah Nineteen seventies\nReally if you go back and look at their start there were nearly always women who are not only women but but angry women who stories we often haven't been taught and if we have been taught them we certainly haven't taught been taught that they were furious and that fury at inequality and injustice was part of what spurred their\nCivic participation and their entrance into organizing\nUm and so part of what the book is attempting to do because I Do think that there is a political consequences to women's anger I think we're living in a period where you're seeing women's fury express politically electorally in terms of protests in striking the teachers' strikes the fast food strikes that are going on right now um\nAnd I think that it's important that we acknowledge the political value in consequence of women's anger and anger that often drives them into participation and these movements and you can and you can see them throughout history\nWell as someone who really takes us to be very seriously as a serious student of history I was struck by was reminded actually of a poem of Adrian riches which many people know uh [noise] which ends with a line the book in which our names to not appearing in which our names and not appear diving into the wrecks because\nYou sort of argue there's a lot of these names don't appear uh although they're appearing war I Would argue Susan B. Anthony Harriet Tubman\nNames like that but nevertheless stories like I had the great fortune of interviewing Rosa Parks minute ago and as you point out there's a story about Rosa Parks me very angry and taking a brick against a young man who was taught to her and really heckling her and saying I'd rather give up my life and put up with this from you\nYeah well this is Rosa Parks is an interesting example because of course she is one of the women whose names we now but we have to ask\nHow we'd been taught the story of Rosa Parks in Nineteen fifty five she refuses to give up her seat on the Montgomery bus and we have been taught about Rosa Parks as and her decision to keep that seat as catalytic ... to the civil rights movement I was taught that in elementary school but here's the version of Rosa Parks that I was taught\nBy the powerful and often by powerful white men is that the institutions that parties are very ideologies begin to depend on on those men and it puts those who are dependent on them for\nAdvocacy and leadership in a very tough position that's part of what has been fraught about meat you\nWere talking Rebecca Traister and she's the author of good and mad the revolutionary power of women's angers he's a writer large from New York magazine and\nAlso struck a by your notion that men can well we saw it in fact the in the recent Supreme Court nomination they can express their anger the way a that was expressed by the nominee Brett Kavanaugh or by Lindsey Graham and went into kind of a ridge fit and everything for women like Christine Blasey Ford's\nWhich is very tempered very controlled and very sympathetic or even Bill Clinton excuse me even the President Trump initially said you know she was impressed with an auditory kinds of things from the fact of the matter is\nIf you have any control over so that if she had looked anger road rage shows would have not gone well known with the public notice there's almost with women and men have certain rules as they can play and there's more license for men to express rage\nOh yeah I mean that's kind of a no show yes\nIt is um women have a very narrow range of expression that we're told will get us taken seriously and that if we become too angry if we express our fury it will in fact undermine\nOur ability to be heard and respected we'll be hurt as emotional or crazy or threatening or scary or laughable or infant tile\nAnd you're going to get you can see that actually in the way that the Republican Party um and it's media are are responding to the protesters themselves there was a Fox News host to ... which was hit very out loud mouse a mob I'm screaming animals was about one Fox News host called the women who yelled through the Senate vote\nI'm Christine Blasey Ford could no more have gone in there storming and yelling on her own behalf even though I think it's it's fair to say that she has an awful lot that she might reasonably have been angry about whether it was the assault itself or the sort of\nAftermath and the impact it had on her life or the way that her name had become public and what her family has gone through since her name has become public she could have been angry about a lot of things but had she'd been she wouldn't have been heard she would have been written off as out of control over emotional\nBy contrast is not just that women aren't allowed to to vent their anger and that men are is that men can use that anger as a tool to bolster the seriousness of their point because we are taught that white men especially\nAre fundamentally rational as are normative citizens right we are taught to X to respect their age and that goes back to the founding the kind of political rage that we fetish dies in this country is the rage of the founders who are white men angry at their lack of representation who anger brought us to revolution and the birth of a new country\nAnd and that is a through line in our history white men can deploy anger on their own behalf and it it amplifies that point we understand them to be reasonable we treat their anger as\nInstructive and diagnostic telling us what's really going on whereas for women the possibility of expressing anger leads to as just missing the point that they're making 'cause it must be coming out of a motion and this is exactly the dynamic that worked with Kavanaugh\nEvery power women's anger

with this book because there's so many messages to women\nAbout what to do or not do in terms of expressing their anger and it's all built around this idea that we have to figure out how to best work the system in which we're in a system that fundamentally doesn't make room for or take seriously our anger and I'm sort of\nTired of telling women that they're ... know do it this way to do it this way I Do it this way in terms of expressing themselves and my argument in this book is that we need to listen to and value the anger of other women differently and when it comes to race I think that

a listener since we were talking about a well let me go to calls for ... before I go to more comments ... joined us here on the good morning\nI think he's been much for taking my call yeah I'm going to try to um remain calm through what is kind of an emotional question I just want to share a really abbreviated story I'm I'm a I had experienced um being a victim of sexual assaults on multiple\nMultiple accounts but from um known perpetrators and unknown perpetrators about the law a left several work environment for hostile\nUh work behaviors um and I bought the active medicated my father the day after my wedding for several years\nUm because of patriarchal behavior that I thought was really diminishing to my life and my question for you Rebecca every everything you're saying Rebecca really resonates with my own personal experiences\nUm but what I'm also curious about it um in in the work that I had to do to kind of reclaimed my life and not just survive but right which I think it's\nOften something that is left out of the discussion of like how are we living on were not survivor how can we the driver is and it gets so my question what are productive pathways are handling anger thank you\nOkay thank you for the good to hear from him I'll go to Rebecca Traister thanks Maya that's a great question and again\nSo much of what my book is about is about\nUm civic participation as a channel for anger and there are so many different ways that we're seeing right\nNow I'm you saw survivors and um\nWomen who were willing and men who are willing to talk about their experiences that having been assaulted or harassed\nUm we have seen simply the willingness to tell the story or to go and hold up a sign or to Yelena ... Senate gallery the the sort of um expressive pathway of protest as one option that is open you're also seeing this year women who are angry about\nUm all kinds of power abuses in channeling that anger into running for office their historic numbers of women who are running for\nState local federal positions many of them first time candidates bird into electoral politics by their anger you see women engaging in strikes UC women working on behalf of candidates I'm getting involved in New kinds of organizations um that are that are building a sort of progressive\nFramework that is not necessarily tied to the Democratic party itself\nSo a lot of the the things that I Am exploring and this happened to be political expressions of anger and ways to participate specifically and politically um but I think in some cases they make correspond to your\nUm personal experience of of angry in participating with in a movement like me to\nTelling your story I'm listening to other people's stories valuing the stories that they tell 'em these are always that\nPart of what we're doing is or what I'm what I Hope to do is to value that anger and and and acknowledge the ways that it feeds into our participation in our social professional and political lives\nLet me start to call her my good to hear from you let me go right to another caller and that's what Anna ... you're on the air good morning\nHigh morning thanks for taking my call and thank you so much for the very timely book\nOn that question is about a women's rage and if it's acceptable when it concerns motherhood children\nI'm particularly thinking of activism the lowest give us when the fighting of toxic waste and love canal ... York and how she and many other self proclaimed house fires ended up taking the agent hostage and it was all because they were concerned about their children\nI think that's an excellent question I was thinking reading your book Rebecca about the mothers against drunk driving about Elena ... who went in and shot someone who's on trial for molesting her son I mean I kind of anger maternal and his countenance a news given the kind of freeway right\nOne of the things that's such a great question and that is such a great example that by so much of having written this book is like then afterwards were memory [laughter] oh my God I shouldn't have written about this too that's such a great example\nUm but Ah yes one of the things I write about are the forms of anger that have been more palatable than others and one of them and I think it's it's ... brand the senator from New York who said to me women can't be publicly angry on their own behalf but they can be angry on behalf of others and because\nI'm women are traditionally valued as mother's um maternal anger or is one of the most acceptable forms of political engagement and you're absolutely right to point to to that kind of environmental activism two mothers against drunk driving um mothers of the movement um\nCan I ask you a question yeah of course when Gillibrand 'cause there's a lot of anger toward her no avail Franken because especially the me too movement she felt really had to condemn Al Franken the access to your\nParents taught at a few women on the river or something to that effect I mean it was never really entirely clear but he stepped down and Trump made fun of him in ... I'm\nWondering what you think about that anger directed to her know from from people on the left who are sympathetic to her claws\nWell one of the things that I Do write about the Franken situation at some length in the book and I'm One of the points that I'm trying to make is that among the the cost of of\nAbuses of sexual as power abusive sexual harassment whatever form it takes it's not just the harm done to those who may have had their ... who may have been groped it's also the harm done within offices and workplace and institutions and and the Frank an example of it\nAn institutions and and the Frank an example is a good example of that Franken's of senator who I admire very much whose politics I shared way things are good feminist but the accusations that were made against him were doing damage\nTo his colleagues and especially to his women colleagues in one of the one of the things that women are asked to do all the time has to police the bad behavior of men\nAs if the responsibility for that bad behavior somehow redound to the shoulders of the women who work with them and so especially for women in the Senate not ... not just care singer brand but lots of the women who are actually doing the work of advocating within their own jobs um for better or laws around sexual harassment and assault on college campuses within the military\n... the fact that they weren't condemning their colleague as not just after one accusation but after three four five six seven\nIt was actually they were being called hypocrites and they didn't and being accused of not really caring about the cause of that they were working on because they weren't applying their standards to their colleague that was putting them in a terrible position now by the same token people accused her she was the first one to call for his resignation but only by a matter of minutes it was twenty of his colleagues\nWho called for his resignation and immediately she was just having been opportunistic which has always been crazy to me because actually they're not a lot of opportunities on offer for women who take on powerful men they are very frequently herbal Lovett men they're frequently punished for it as ... brand has been but the options on offer to those women weren't great because if they hadn't condemned him\nThey're very work would have been undermined for the you know for years to come I think we would have seen that within the hearings on Brett Kavanaugh not if Franken had been sitting on the Judiciary Committee it was like Ted Kennedy sitting on Anita Hill's Judiciary Committee\nIt would have been difficult for him to open his mouth without the ideological opposition saying well how can you talk about this because you're still here and you didn't face consequences\nI mean I think that these the thing that is not clear to a lot of people is it the options for the women who were Franken's colleagues were crappy in both directions either way they chose it was going to it was going to do damage to them and that is a really unfortunate byproducts\nOf sexual harassment and the impact it has not just on the accused or on the people who are bringing the allegations but on those who work around them\nHe wrote about Harvey Weinstein and you know compared to what you want to sort of Al Franken seems almost a\nThis was I guess would created a lot of anger a seems to\nBe a very different part of that spectrum I guess there's comment from just loses his female rage politically one sided I'd like to find common ground between liberal and conservative women but I feel like there was more ridge coming from the Democrats would this time how can we be United to bring about change for all women regardless of party affiliation\nWell it may feel as though there's more rage coming from Democrats and a lot of the a lot of the political rage I write about in this book is is fundamentally progressive but that is not to say the elements rages progressive in fact\nThe rage of conservative women white women um has been extremely potent in the past you know if you think about Phyllis Schlafly who led an army of angry white women who are angry at the disruptions provoked by the second wave women's movement um", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "10"}
