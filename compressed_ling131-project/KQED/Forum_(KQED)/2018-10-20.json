in today for me to Kim well let me shop was elected mayor of Oakland four years ago breaking out of a big group of candidates with help from my late endorsement from Jerry Brown now shaft is running for reelection saying that she's helped make Oakland a more desirable place to live and work\nChallengers and there are many of them say Oakland is losing its soul as wealthier residents push out long time residents who can no longer afford to live there there are many other issues as well or if chef is reelected she'll be the first Oakland Mayor to serve two consecutive terms since Jerry Brown\nIn this hour we're looking at the issues facing Oakland and its next mayor whoever that happens to be\nWith me here in the studio sun ... she's East Bay reporter for kick you eat in an Oakland resident Hey Scott had morning\nAlso here Kimberly Becker ... she is a staff writer for the San Francisco chronicle Kimberly welcome to you as well get mining and Darwin bond Grammys a journalist with ... express eye banks were coming in\nWhat would give you a chance to sort of weigh in on this but this idea just to be give us the big picture of Oakland to sort of what are the issues I just kind of briefly touched on them like what's the\nWhat's the mood over there of the voters well Oakland\nCity undergoing rapid massive change and it's very visible in terms of the ... in the sky and the homeless in and has a population on the street\nRight you can see the fact that the city is changing and cause a lot of anxiety amongst Oakland residents particularly longtime Oakland method and particularly black and Latino people of color and said there are definitely feeling like they're city is slipping away from them on the other hand you're seeing a lot more opportunity in Oakland for businesses more jobs\nOr you know more roads getting paved things like that so it definitely is it's a city at a crossroads in many ways and the question is what next four years look like and whether or not they're kind of some of the most important for years in Oakland future because they might decide which direction if he goes\nTo you do have this giant slate of candidates eleven totally get off I've kept track and and you you ... and you know has sort of being a presence that many people really appreciate many people really like she's got a lot of firms support in Oakland but you also have some progressive candidates who are\nIn a sense almost writing but you might call the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez that wave and the rest of the you know sort of like social Democrat again establishment Democrat right which you could say that this race kind of been bodies in a sense even though from the outside at Libby shaft\nStanding against Trump and and and you know at warning that the ice that's kind of makes her look like a progressive within Oakland she's actually not that progress accounting\nMental health resources\nFor the homeless she similarly has sort of a zero tolerance policy she wants to implement on a police officer to engage in misconduct\nSo you know her focus really on um police accountability and transparency and bringing in some of the more traditionally a county services to the city\nAnd other no really quickly on price Darwin was talking about the sex scandal and the police department and she first sort of you know got attention and and made a profile known because she represented on the young woman who was sort of a exploited and not scandal so she was sort of the one time attorney there\nAnd some of your uh kept Brooks and Pamela price both African American will be will be chef courses white how does race play into this race\n[laughter] well I mean I don't think you can escape race in American politics right now and you certainly can't escape race in Oakland when we're talking about uh\nYou know displacement of people were talking about just basement of black and brown people and so when we're talking about the changing of Oakland we're talking about the transformation of Oakland from what was an almost majority black city in the in the eighties to um you know a a city that has a shrinking population and that is definitely part of black folks going\nSo this this isn't the guy particularly interested in but um many uh many black people similar leaving the state rights and are going to Texas and other places but those who are staying within California are\nI'm kind of going further and further out for a long time they were going to Antioch I'm In places like that\nAnd now they're going even further out to the Central Valley some are going to Sacramento um there's definitely as sort of a mass exodus of what had been Oakland black population and I think that definitely plays a role I think it also plays a role in terms of the way in which we're talking about this progressive coalition because we've been talking about\nUm more and more women of color running for positions of power for political power in this country and so I think that can be applied to this race as well now Libby shaft definitely seems to have the lead in this race she's got the infrastructure she by far has more money than anyone else\nBut when you put cat Brooks and Pamela price together as I said a coalition the question is can you get out the vote of young white progressive that Bernie Sanders crowd many of whom support cat Brooks\nAnd that sort of traditional a black voter is from the flat land many of whom support Pamela price can you bring those two together and create a coalition that strong enough to take on\nA ... who has a sort of establishment a presence\nAnd a darn what about ... I think at some point ... said they were going to open up a headquarters in Oakland they change their mind uh what other big companies you referred to Amazon I think a moment ago uh what is the extremely San Francisco tech has taken over the economy and a lot of ways\nA as a tech workers they're they're very prevalent now and the culture and the\n... and just sort of a discussion around what's happening in San Francisco to what extent is that true in Oakland is true to some extent but yeah ...\nFamously um bought the Sears building and then sold it probably for profit um and they're not moving there now but um there are actually\nProfit\nAnd they're not moving there now but um there are actually tech companies and other very like high end you know like white ... do you know law firms um biotech companies that are in Oakland and that are moving their um that sector of the economy is growing and it's employment in the city\nUp but it run Oakland also remains very much an industrial city\nAnd this is actually something that previous city councils and mayors have been very successful at doing which is maintaining the port of Oakland and the waterfront as a working waterfront so that that's going to remain a big employment driver I'm for that for Oakland and for the East Bay for the foreseeable future\nTalking about the Oakland marriage race Libby chef facing a challenge from ten other candidates our guest this hour ... D also Kimberly ... from the chronicle and Darwin on the ground from the East Bay express\nWe haven't talked much about sports so there was ... I think today's who are trying to find a ballpark or a space to build a ballpark the raiders are leaving for Vegas some people say good written some people are heartbroken or the warriors are coming over here to San Francisco how's any or all of that playing out is that is that something you know and who does it who's the benefits\nI think there's a pretty small constituency who places the ballpark as their top issue or even among their top issues um in fact that was one of the reasons why mayor shaft\nWas willing to let the raiders go because she knew that voters didn't want a lot of public money going into professional sports stadium\nA so right now you have the Oakland is looking for their next ballpark and we were just talking a lot about displacement and gentrification and that was a big reason why they didn't get their first choice by which would have been nearly any college and like merit\nThere was a big community there are these like community it's a lot of immigrants there a lot of Asian Americans not as low income people who were worried\nThat the development that would surround the new ballpark would hike up their rent and not make them have to go somewhere else\nAnd a Saudi a cat Brooks and Pamela price of it what are they saying about\nThe ... as far as I say it's not really too much on their radar somewhere deep down and I yeah I mean you know sports I think that like one of the things that you that you're pointing out is that you've got\nOftentimes any bells and then public money goes to ... to building stadiums that really is a large driver of displacement intensification\nAnd so in a sense on that on that side ladies actually done what most progressive would advocate which is to not hand over that money for for for sports teams obviously I think that Oakland will real in the next few years the writers have left before\nThen maybe some people are prepared but with the raiders going at the same time as the warriors and with the warriors going to over ... over to San Francisco I think there'll be there'll be there and that's in the bars but I don't know that it will necessarily go over to the ballot box\nIs there a lot of debate or any debate about what to do with the ... with oracle and with you know the A's a ballpark quarters huge amount of land rags to bart yeah so now that a lot of housing there\nYeah but it's also it's also a big problem to the city because I'm finding a developer you can take all of that over and competently rebuild\nThis giant slice of land in east Oakland and it's it's what surrounds that land is not particularly appealing to most developers it's very low income neighborhoods next right on the freeway right by the freeway and some like heavy industry and very polluted um areas\nBut does anyone in the if if nothing else it's an opportunity for development to turn it into something with jobs and you know something attractive for businesses\nAs it is it's just extremely difficult to find someone who can come in and has the right skill set and can raise the financing I mean it's it's like a multibillion dollar development project\nIf you go back to elections ago it was ... versus ... I'm Sorry versus a Rebecca kept women Jean Quan they sort of teamed up against Peralta\nAnd a Jean Quan ended up winning and the rag choice election Rebecca ... had been kind of a of another president said in the city council Sandia and she had been thought to be maybe running she didn't\nShe didn't actually to support behind kept perhaps um she ... she ran a\nIn the in the last election as well when you also had three women on the top of the ... about you know the ballot and I think what's interesting again is that we're again talking about three women\nSo you know Oakland might be a lot of things but it's definitely becomes the women rulers um so you call that Oakland being in the political guys but yes the backup capital and decided not to to win and his instead supporting cap rex\nYeah and you know Jerry Brown of course put his thumb on the scale on behalf of Libya shot four years ago a grand or does is he getting involved at all or Darwin I'm Sorry to getting involved in all this time\nBut yeah he I mean he endorsed Libby shop again um but he's not not campaigning for her not really but you know last time he into doesn't force he he didn't really either he I think he just had like one event\nI'm at her campaign headquarters and just sort of rallied people and maybe you know got got a little more interest in the campaign but it wasn't like he was out there on the trail you know giving speeches and stuff\nAnd we're coming up on a break Sunday of but just you know in general is this an election that has motivated captivated board people I mean what how would you describe how engaged ... Oakland or is are you know in this election\nThat depends on which Oakland you're talking about um you definitely have you know\nMany people in some of the flat lands who are less engaged at because they have too much to worry about whether they can pay rent and those are the voter is that if you can get them out or you might be able to change the kind of poll said the selection they are the voters who always traditionally vote\n'em there's along going staying in Oakland that the hills determine who wins mayoral election um but if you can capture people in the flat land than you can definitely change that narrative I Will say there are a lot of young white progressive Oakland errors who are newcomers to the city who definitely\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro at Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nOr the Oakland Mayor is election and also the city at a crossroads in the future of Oakland give us a call if you want to\nWeigh in eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six is the number eight six six seven three three six seven eight six you can also email your comments a forum\nAt ... dot org or tweet at us if you like it at ... Scott Shafer here today for me to Kim [noise] stay with us\nIn the sense of for um rebroadcast there is a serious accident on the Golden Gate bridge though hopefully Ted Anthony it'll be a long and just a moment to give us the details\nI I think it's just you know created a huge country in terms of funding for this study is how you know you have to live and ... on the council and the mayor who say you know we want more affordable housing by you know look at our bunch and it's it's ... we have to find tensions satirized south are we talking about pensions\nSome of them I mean that's a huge issue I don't really want to talk about [laughter] yeah it's sort of thing on the back burner interesting what's going to\nMove making its way to the front burner let me tell you\nA let's go to the phones again the number eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six and we'd go to Paul in Oakland I fall\n[noise] get a good morning yeah my comment is I'm a long time resident of when and you know it's kind of ironic with ... or one let me ... talks about immigrants and protecting them and yet when you look on her street it's primarily African Americans have been pushed out\nFrom the housing and just from the overall economic changes and it just it just seems like it\nDoesn't make much sense that they're putting the amount of energy and two people who don't\nUm I think what a Paul was trying to say there is that there's a feeling that\nUm the sanctuary yeah the the issue of creating sanctuary for immigrants\nIs being used as a political um this this cynical interpretations was being used as a political proper is people are running against Trump because that's easy and it with their base but they're not addressing the real needs um that are that ... in Oakland and the city awhile back issued this thing called the equity indicators report\nAnd it showed that across the board in every category you can possibly measure\nAfrican Americans are suffering in Oakland more than any other or racial group\nUm housing in security joblessness um affects ah in environmental racism\nBut just across the board and the feeling is not there the the needs of the African American community just aren't being met and that image or immigration is being brought up as a as an opportunistic issue ... that's what I've observed from some ... but ... other people are going to express it differently and that may sound like a something\nKind of more horrible stimulus so quickly just bring it back to the mayor's race it's interesting to Oakland chamber of commerce issued as\nA result of a poll this morning and it showed that among all races on their shots is leading however when you look specifically at African American voters are actually more split between her and her challenger Pamela price\nUm and when you look to at across all better she's also leading but among progressive that's much more competitive\nAs well and that may be a good time to just talk about right towards voting or we'll have looted to that earlier with Don product a race a few years ago but ... ... what is your son who should say\nHow rain choice voting worse ah it's ah you know you get three votes in a sense and you rank your top three candidates one two three and if your top candidate is at the bottom of those votes get redistributed\nUm what is your son Sunday or or if you know how rank choice voting might play out obviously would it work well against ... or is there some thought that it could also do the same ...\nYeah I think they're absolutely as I mean anything's possible Oakland Oakland as a place that has had been known for kind of political craziness and the past and if anything is possible and I do think that\nThe most important thing about rank choice voting other than understanding\nOn is that it can group\nGroups that politicians can team together to take on a set of powerful and and better numbering opponent rights\nSo we know that that would be shocked right now but what that means and and I think she's pulling as at at at thirty seven percent according to the um the chamber of commerce says recent Paul but it also means that Pamela price and kept Bronx I both pulling at Seventeen percent still\nHave those numbers come together and actually studying that actually create a kind of almost equal opposition we'll competition\nAlthough it's rarely I'm usually it's really easy all of a second votes go to one person\nTo stare at you I mean what it what it does is it makes it very competitive in a way that might not be without ... and so they can give the sort of so called progressive coalition a lot more power\nBut is there an active campaign the way there was with Rebecca Kaplan and a Jean Quan pet Pamela\nPrice is saying if you don't vote for me first or or if you vote for me first pick cap Brooks is that your number two she's actively saying that the other candidates aren't really saying the same thing and you don't you don't quite see that kind of book coalition emerging\nRight let's go to the phones again again the number eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six and Robert in Emeryville welcome\nYou know you're right I'm a businessman here in Oakland and when they put it right place it just made a trash can of Oakland\nWhere Jean Quan came in there and just for the whole nightmare so business people and when you get in there and you'll be ... I met her\nAnd with all that mess over just going down to you and just opening the door for all these high tech people coming in here they're just taking over everything and open it or repeal coming across borders taking all the money away from our people when they hear like a minority so\nIt doesn't change here you might as well forget it\nWell let me ask you Robert as a as a business person or is there is some benefit to businesses from having all this economic development\nOh no because if\nIt's a mess because the opening businesses can't stay in business because they have all the barriers like the waist chain\nSheriff and they're just wipe out any kind of direction towards putting the money where does the most ... most good if you look at oh good technical high school and look at the graduate from there\nNo future for them because they the if a mess over there to their students and not being taught the leading and so the people with all the money but take it all over the good stuff\nYeah Kimberly we haven't really talked about the schools in the mirror doesn't control the schools are but uh you know ... has education and I know there's talk about closing schools a few months ago because of budget cuts and consolidation how how big an issue is that\nYeah educate yourself to do the educational thing and the big money doesn't go where it's needed them\nOkay let's let's have Kimberly way and again\nTo one thing to note as you mentioned is that Oakland Unified School district as an independent governance structure a fight it's you know their budget problems and they are huge we're talking millions of dollars that\nThey're just completely in the rat on it does come in to some city issues I'm the mayor has championed that's Oakland promise program which is sort of that\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solutions celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it in for Mike Rowe dot com\nOkay let's let's have really way again so one thing to note as you mentioned is that Oakland Unified School district as an independent governance structure a fight it's you know their budget problems and they are huge we're talking millions of dollars that\nThey're just completely in the red um it does come in to some city issues\nI'm the mayor has championed that's Oakland promise program which is sort of the cradle to college you know let's make sure our babies have opportunities regardless of their skin color um so it it does affect a you know see campaigning in such\nA insomnia Roberts Roberts' point I mean is there a sense that the you know all this economic development just isn't benefiting it's all going to people who are moving into the city the tech workers and people in the in the hills a kind of thing oh yeah that's absolutely\nA sense that local businesses suffer because you have only the ability for instance with incredible capital to come in and you have to take take as much as you did in San Francisco right you know it it's very much the same way when the love and play says kind of closed down\nYou know every week it feels like and I think that that whether or not I would have happened anyway cities change right at you know nothing is going to stop these in changing as a real sense of personal often often that's definitely and I think that I'm watching Oakland changes in really\nAnxiety producing for a lot of people in his driving a lot of this conversation but I think it is important to talk about schools and the fact that when you're talking about housing\nPrices increasing you're talking about teachers not being able to afford to live in Oakland anymore\nAnd when when you're talking about housing rents going out you're also talking about commercial rents going up at the same time ...\nTo ... to the caller's point also um the industries that Oakland is attracting right now these are industries that take an incredible amount of education to get a job in and Oakland schools like castle Mont\nI'm I'm a climate wins um Freemont high\nEven skyline the the education that the students are getting there is not good it's it's not it's not good right now\nAnd they can't get these jobs in the tech sector so people see you know software engineering and um the these very high and positions they can't grasp then and then at the at the the lower level jobs these working class jobs don't pay enough to live in the city any more I think that's what the caller is kind of\nKind of saying there when he's linking you know education and jobs in the sense that um\nBut there is a solution it seems to me would be to improve the schools not tell those kinds of employers go way go somewhere else\nRight but the to improve the schools is incredibly difficult problem and um you know they've been digging themselves out of state receivership for years now and it it it almost you know last year it looked like they might have been headed back there and so\nRight let's go back to the phones are back to Oakland and Steve welcome\nTomorrow should be a little bit cooler cooler

God well visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage\nPresident Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing\nHe did not criticized the Saudis and beer ... was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a it confirmed\nThe obvious to Mr showed jihad died or in their custody the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big said a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people from different at Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called to show you just ask the unacceptable but also right away scot pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWith a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers off and on the dollar amount is exaggerated according to ... as the number of jobs and we'll say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting a gift giving up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies\nHow quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like uh not sell with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he presented argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested stamina Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about that that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border\nAnd lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation to every traffickers smuggler drug dealer\nAnd the illegal alien on the planet come on come on and so\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of your mouth ...\nAnd very down ... thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth to show gee\nWe turn now to even do there he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us\nGlad to be here based on all of your experience to the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saturday a explanation by the president of how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in ... in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French\nWho do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there was a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends\nAnd allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership\nFirst of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world will be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a if not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps them talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely\nWe can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior and coffee weeks is unacceptable\nUber gold or thank you thank you\nInstead of depressed 'cause we've got a new ad campaign to encourage tourism or at least not disappoint those who do come to visit one ad shows a happy

we've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis is that the face of addiction can be just about any fish in a ritual that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days\nChurch many readers this week it included a photo of us Marlene fish of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Hayden\nWas grinning from his perch on her back that photo shoot a good day from it but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production ...\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and limbs to mere died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joined just know from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to\nThanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her sons so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really loved the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm into farm and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty\nThis past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all we're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of\nUm disappeared again\nShe drove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carry that help for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our ... our you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like math a donor buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her use and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nUnderstand there's going to be a service for ... some day there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a bonding rate song she's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction

at ... studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nThe big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable\nFor the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... or work in Texas in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York but another story in this election is the very opposite\nThe candidates who are running as extreme as on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew Moran who's been covering the movement known as the old right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics injure you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like my concern is that ... for example who was involved in peace the gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacists have been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it\nIt's never really not exist but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely note that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was first campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because\nHe was ... tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he ... he denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that the alliance should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability and then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump's partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there is no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kind of gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat too doesn't delete them he kind of says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walked back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of the king's statements about diversity is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start that's the way the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats and adding up as panic than black and he predicts there'll be a greater number that white America I predict the panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that uh I mean there are there are much more extreme example of his rhetoric than that but basically it's\nThat's kind of a turning the tables have saying by talking about ah you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that if they're for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forgot how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super like grow at Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solutions celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nOr you know the black voting block or the ... voting bloc\nAnyone doing that if they're for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably wash their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is the guy they're not pulling funding from him at least not in the way that they're making public\nSo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan field they cannot afford to reject somebody like\nKing it's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber predator fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and what does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't we weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that\nYou know yeah ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here I think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety with a extremely a dicey racial history\nThat perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want a vote for the other guy there's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy\nWell let's talk about the other guy his opponent Kim's opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. show the show and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe's still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms with the district thing it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not the only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seemed to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in the way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like course Stewart he was someone who the Virginia a GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support he's doing better than one would expect I mean he\nHe won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments\nWe can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so not the heart of the confederacy out of the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey in the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap that an outlier incidents that have very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of the extremists voice and\nYeah I think he I think the Seth Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more in most cases than that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nIt's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy set Grossman is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that you know this is happening everywhere all the time\nAnd then the course of that discovered that Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security advisor um had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to the sanctions\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating vice president Pence\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information sensibly to people in the administration who were then providing health information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that\nThe Russians knew that too and because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it's it's a black man so what did you like what happened that um so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel 'em and told him that I needed to come see 'em right away\nTold him what we have learned that\nYou know the vice president have been on face the nation and as saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so\nYou got the VP out there saying this up so we told 'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd when you go see him a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back ... was that different are the same or what it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before the sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official lies to another\nAnd what did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which\nGod that would help people would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public\nThat that was a trip so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January\nSponsorship of the kick you read the live stream by super micro Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at uber micro dot com\nMajority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow ... and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nSo how did you find out about the travel there um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd I get a call I was able to keep one aide with may want a system my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and So Matt calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times\nAnd it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of traveled path\nWe spent the weekend\nI'm trying to get our arms around in communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and by Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and it's been a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges work\nWhat the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges by the constitutional statutory late and otherwise that have been filed um\nAnd at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was it it became clear that to defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send a department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job of the department of justice to defend\nActions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or ... you're the president's ... the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend us\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy Graham perhaps the appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that um but not direct the department not to defend it but\nHere's what's different is that I happen to believe no medical should go into court and make an argument that's not grounded in truth but the department of justice [noise] I mean\n[noise] it's the OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked a defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted interest\nOn but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside and that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I wasn't like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general with the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions who they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that was a mall for wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that\nYou know none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will you saying no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication\nAnd we had both we had there were communication is going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the direct it to the department and then what happens [noise] um I was fired you\nWere fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump did that surprise you or ... how did you think the story was going to end once you said you weren't\nGoing to allow the\nTravel ban to defend it\nLook I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for you know with a probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped that maybe there was a chance that by doing this that\nWould cause them to step back\nAnd take a breath and look at what they were doing and more ... okay I Know\nEverybody got caught impolite so loud enough [laughter] it seems kind of silly now doesn't it um\nBut you know I did harbored\nKind of silly now doesn't it um but you know I did harbored this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of getting cut 'em there would be real discussion about this um\nI had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um\nI suppose you could say that the president made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was unlawful and unconstitutional I think it's absolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country\nAnd [noise]\nKelly is a long time just part of the fish will we be acting attorney general it starts with the Trump Administration fell you spoke with Jeffrey ... even if the
