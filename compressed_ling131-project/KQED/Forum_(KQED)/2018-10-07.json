Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of gotten negative connotation and I had to press\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on keep your head down learn English go to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese has and\nHave kids by a big house for yourself and keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown\nWhich has bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me my mom works odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakery my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker\nAnd when he'd come back on Sundays knee and my brother's a take turns massaging his back\nWhile I'm\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America\nAmerican and so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China and I asked my dad who every rooting for [noise]\nI don't know of course China\nI joined ... of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought\nAsk that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause a ruckus right but I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was\nExcited to watch a PBS documentary about becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nPeople that\nSeen three people who ever looked like me Jackie Chan trainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch\nThese last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identities their life they were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American man who was beaten to death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their job\nThey fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest went through his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and pay three thousand dollars for the men stuff\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine X people\nAre now saying if this happened to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so\nMy mom happened to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat's your family\nWhat\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related and easy like a cousin of a cousin of a cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened\nI look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish and her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask about a murder man in our family\nI had nothing to stay at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I started looking of articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother ... ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured\nAt her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers a boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's at\nSome moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who\nWill each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family a someone who spoke up to be bought again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who\nEach in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer\nThe city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit and I think an eight hour mega bus to Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to Stephen since ... grave\nWe she drives us\nAnd we find Vincent Chin name on a tombstone lowly chains name on a tombstone and little each and husband's name on a tombstone they're no longer goals\nThere right below my feet\nThere are no longer goals\nThey are right below my feet\nAnd I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why does means\nSo much to me I go\nThe next states in my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums that my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters\nThe second sister on the list is Long Beach and so now I Know ... chin is my grandmother's sister lily chin is my mother first on and Vincent Chin is my mother first cousin\nSo I asked my eighth grade ... who what happens to lowly after Vincent ...\nDied she tells me well when Vince inside lowly was all alone in Detroit\nSo your grandmother and I ... sisters flew to America from China to support her your mom and dad had married in China so your dad teen soon after they all found work in New York and that's how your family ended up in Manhattan's Chinatown\nName is Elaine ...

angry about confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a nonpartisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll\nAll suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this as a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but just as soon as Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're at Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of a terribly polarized political process and environment than we listen\nI'm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep her relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust

into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted\nBy a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to state you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because this story was all I knew and it was so important\nTo all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you are of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre set to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know it shouldn't matter to anybody\nElse how's that defined what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even\nUm despite all the things that were happening where\nAnd um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this
