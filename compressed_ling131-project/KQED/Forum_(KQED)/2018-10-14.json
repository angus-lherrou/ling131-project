were particularly hard hit when the eye of hurricane Michael pass through starting with the latest on the relief effort is NPR's Joel Rose in Miramar Beach Florida the morning time we live\nUh you've been in Panama City and the surrounding towns I mean tell me what you're seeing\nWell it feels like the relief effort really is getting underway now at least in and around Panama City and took a few long days after the storm for the official response to sort of get off the ground\nBut I really saw difference on Saturday there were multiple locations in Panama City and other towns where emergency officials are handing out food and water like we just heard of the top\nBut that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast started at a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland and there are very long lines which supplies all over the region lots of people need help\nYeah and the pictures of devastation or are incredible how much is this is still without electricity right any any sense when it's coming back\nYeah there are still tens of thousands of people without power the local utility Gulf Power estimates and it's going to restore electricity to most of the region by the end of the week\nBut that estimate does not include some of the hardest hit areas right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks I Would say maybe months just driving around in Panama City I mean it's unbelievable the number of electrical poles that are down you see power lines in the street everywhere you can't really drive without driving over them\nAnd at the same time there's no water nominee gas stations are open the ones that do have gas have really long lines so I think things are gonna be pretty rough year for the foreseeable future\nSays Joel what are people telling you they're going to deal with it and stick it out are they going to leave\nI think a lot of people may not have any choice I mean boats in and around Panama City and out in the countryside that is just one of the poorest regions of Florida are places where people a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck and just you know right now a lot of the people I've talked to her are focused on just getting through today and tomorrow you know trying to get water and ice\nTrying to get a tarp to cover up the hole in the roof maybe before it rains um although luckily there is no rain in the immediate forecasts but you know that's where people's minds are\nYeah we've heard there were really big problems also with communications is is that getting any better\nOr not that I've seen most of cell carriers are still down around Panama City I mean many even emergency officials don't have phones that work um so it you know it's a big problem people can't call their relatives to say they're okay um and and it's I think has to be one of the things that's really slowing down the rescue and relief effort\nAs rhetorical tensions with the U.S

been following all these races and she joins me now to break them down he Jessica Hi Lulu so\nCan Democrats cut into the geo piece edge among governors they haven't\nReally good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important state so they were able to drop congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what state are you watching\nHeading into this last month with the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nToppled pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew
