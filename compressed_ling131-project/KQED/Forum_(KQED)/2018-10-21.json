spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner\nDeath he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now have this\nDo you want to have a baby silence\nHe turns around and I see that he is laughing at me this is the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of hail Ian Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that she's a freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nTo a baby\nA this isn't some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender ah for me that means that I was born female I'm I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um stats literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body or and this was made news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant\nThat um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy um which is what I did um [noise]\n\nI I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine which just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not ... he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby a\nAnd we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have any beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am I'm\nBut I uh live in a world of rainbows end unicorns ah and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer\nI'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we've started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really growth [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know and everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse and he's a pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it\nAnd there were two lines and I was pregnant and it was going to be a baby [laughter] but also super scared 'cause you have to do a lot of things that get ready for baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\nHaley unwind we'd been toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly um and all of those ah markers of femininity in everything just gotten bigger everywhere\nAnd I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nKey to this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on to my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like best or my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things nobody cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the things that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life\nSo that's what I did um I just went into that and then I just let everything else\nGo ahead and made around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people\nOf color but for all of us there is also joy and love and and resilience in family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nAnd we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone there'll be that um [noise] CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I lived in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and more than one way to be trams um a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really\nUgly Harry woman and

hundred candidates trying for nearly\nTwo hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most at threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul\nThe suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling includes used we know that they burned down one polling center outside that of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul I brought his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan government has announced it's arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful science though this time around as a number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many on the symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of
