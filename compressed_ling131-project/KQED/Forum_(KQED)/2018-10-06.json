it's great to be her Tania\nSo you've been you've been on the college circuit you were at Stanford last night and you've been really across the country talking to young people\nI Know the onion onions been around since I was in college how young people um [noise]\nHow do they how do they interface with you and how do they do they have that same relationship with the onion\nYes they all know of it but more so recently people are telling me oh my dad got me into the [laughter]\nWhich is a little depressing right on that too bad so but you know they see it on social media and it's out there so and the people who come to the talks unless it's mandated by the school or something\nThey are interested in you know they've heard of it they like it and they want to meet the guy behind it so yeah so I read this book um [laughter] that's awesome yeah actually read\nI read it over a a few days and I was going to say to my first question to you really what's going to be why they tack why he allowed mass and then I happened to check I eat lines Twitter feed this morning and his tweet from yesterday as\nTesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla and get any image they want laser etched glass and set to deep space for millions of years and I just cracked out because I Swear it sounds like that comes directly from your\nBook yes so that's one of the reasons why I like covering subject matter like this\nBecause when somebody is so absurd and I wrote a book about Donald Trump a half years ago that's right right after the election or actually I wrote well before the election oh you do yeah uh it was called Trump's America by this book in Mexico will pay for it\nAnd you must be in the same category because they're sort of larger than life crazy eccentric billionaire characters\nWho a lot of people say kind of defy satire because they're already kind of living high per beliefs\nAnd you know that's just like a challenge to me like oh you think I Can't do such um this person just watch so then I I Love about putting together material on them and and\nUh seeing what happens with it so the great thing that does happen or when it does\nAnd it's kind of what led to the onion because I was kind of a camper celebrity with this popular comic strip that I did and so the two guys who started the onion or came to me before a they put out issue one to see if I wanted to be involved so\nVery quickly I was ... editor and then after a few months they sold it to me\nAnd left and so I was owner editor for many years after that yes why not the longest running editor yeah I think by far I'm I think I I've logged like Fifteen Years as editor in chief on and off like I go and and\nThink I'm done and then somehow get thrown back in and then I leave again and then I get dropped drawn back in\n... interesting thing is that while I'm a nineties college person and I I remember at the onion and he was very clear that this was satire um we're now in this age of um fake news and you have really strong feelings about\nUm what the onion guys and this idea fake news satire versus fake news talk a little bit about that yeah I\nDo because when the onion came out it was the only thing of it's kind of fake newspaper doing fake news any confused a lot of people but eventually they would understand the joke and they would get it and everybody was enjoying it\nBut as it grew\nIt spawned a things like the Daily Show because um when John Stewart started the Daily Show he actually hired my right hand guy then Carlin to be his show runner executive producer because he wanted to make the Daily Show more like the onion like a fake news parity show and then had helped me do that at the onion\nAnd so John hired him to do that and then when he was there he co created the coup air show with Stephen compare\nWhich was even more like the onion and the Daily Show because now there was no breaking character and you know the onion never breaks character and didn't even though they are decent early you got that shrine to do an onion tire you show that some great trivia about the onion so under Dana ... show\nWe a hearty [laughter] yeah I Know that that there's a great documentary about that show on Netflix 'cause it had the most amazing writing staff Steve krill I'm Jim ... bears Luis C K Robert smuggle\nIt was an incredible staff and the show was a complete bomb because it was just in the wrong time it was on a ABC like in prime time and they were trying to be a little edgy and it's just did not work anyway so we were working with them producing a some news bits that Steven Quebec or read\nOn the show and it was the first fake news that he read as a young person in the mid to late nineties so\nYeah getting back to the story of satire so\nThere was a whole generation of people who grew up only seeing satire through the lens of news parity because there was the onion there was the Daily Show there was no bearing on so many imitators\nAll other satire was really relegated to um [noise] obscurity and so for a lot of people the term satire is equivalent to fake news like they just assuming\nSatire is equivalent to fake news like they just assume it's the same thing whereas no actually satires thousands of years old and there have been satirical plays and novels and art and all sorts of stuff\nSo in the twenty sixteen election when people put out propaganda set a ... was masquerading as news they literally labeled at satire ... thinking that that term was a political because it was fake news again not the same thing that's just propaganda\nSatire is when you try to ah make Schumer\nBy pointing out what's wrong with the world and communicating to people so yeah what those people are doing even though I Do bear some responsibility for the existence of all the propaganda really they're doing they're not doing satire and it's wrong and it's completely different from what the onion does where if you were fooled by it\nThat's not the point the point is to maybe become a little bit more of a critical thinker and be entertained by it and\nIf you take it seriously then that's your fault it's on you especially if you're somebody who should know better like somebody in a position of authority which sadly happens too often\nMhm we're talking with Scott decker is founder of the onion dot com and author and editor of welcome to the future which is mind by not to eat ... mask on\nYou costs humor science I'm really interested in the process of creating an article like the onion or their pitch is like a newsroom or is it something like creating an F ...\nYeah I think it is a little different and I do believe him reading is a science I wrote a whole nonfiction book about it a very serious book called how to write funny just lays out all my process for how to do it at names parts of the process that never had names before and\nA lot of people have used that book to learn to write comedy and been very successful so it's totally true and like I was saying before you can teach comedy\nAnd I started this program at the second city this kind of based on my book to teach people how to write prose humor and a yet a lot of people have come out of those classes and gotten jobs that are working in comedy now after a very short time period yeah so that's very exciting\nFor me the system at the onion just to summarize it and maybe how it's different from SNL is\nFirst of all it's all about a quantity like you have to produce a lot of jokes and then stiffed through those jokes to find the best ones but this is where things get tricky because in a place like SNL from what I understand I've never worked there [noise]\nPeople pitch their ideas in person and then the head writer sort of says yea or nay or maybe depending on the vibe in the group or maybe Lauren or somebody decides what to do [noise]\nI knew instinctively at the onion that that was the wrong way to do it because as soon as the person in charge is seen as\nAssessing people's work as their pitching it than politics enters the situation any kind of dynamic that's going on in the room is going to affect it people are going to write jokes that are going to appease the boss or\nThe the boss might favor people who she likes more or whatever\nAnd sadly it's almost always a he in comedy yeah and so at the onion we made it into a meritocracy where jokes were red without names\nYou pick the most boring sounding person in the room to just read off this lady of jokes to replicate the experience of the reader 'cause they don't know who's pitching the job and I see it they just see the joke yeah so it has to rise or fall on its own merit and then\nThese meetings are boring where you're just sitting there listening to joke after joke after joke and then\nEvery once in a while you hear a joke and you'll go oh that one wasn't too bad you know and then that gets put on the shortlist and then the next day you look at the shortlist\nAll these jokes like barely you know there's almost never laughter like when you're going through these jokes 'cause it's such a boring process but that's good because that means only the real strong jokes are going to survive\nYeah and then I I also find it really fascinating the the headlines because the headlines are I mean there are viral onion or stories that people have never clicked on the actual story themselves it's just the headline that carries it\nRight right well there are some uh headlines on the onion that don't come with stories ... ... you know because when you have your shortlist of headlines some of them have legs so you know that you can spend this out and write a story about others there's nothing more you can say the headline says it also just go go with the headline or picture you know at best\nWe are talking with Scott daycares ... with the onion dot com and author and editor of welcome to the future which is mine by not easy line mask\nDo you

confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school making McConnell columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome entry Georgia's Megan thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause and the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nI don't think so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes\nFunnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it doesn't look to possible\nThat they can from me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it\nTo the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated\nThese were serious allegations [noise] um and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate this did did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true I never had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically choose the crowd I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically to these corporation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople they're basically shootings of cooperation were her therapist notes which seemed to say look she talked about this all they're not like having a name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master

all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen ...\nLet me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's in she's on Christian bus you forward a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support Frank a judge\nNow the world from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out such the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully till ... memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying he was just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews stir Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story\nAnd it's it's way worse than what ... making the carousel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n... [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course he's your jacket of editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nWhen when Donald Trump ... over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing for low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that if Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale is his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is set on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n... is there anything that you that you can recognizing that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize just distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the buildings so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company it was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pockets of differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it mostly may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president's the most about what I think\nThat's not what bothers the president's the most about what I think\nReally will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he ... he earned his living on his own rather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which was essentially the story he's been put out there for a long time\nTemperatures range today

power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young and irresponsible I was young and responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with it and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement it's helped me to understand a little bit about how\nWhen power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have been behave that way it's like discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good mad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes\nAnd systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good\nUm [noise] what's that you often [noise] um it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh gosh\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women\nI was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been ... by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class\nUm that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women\nAnd one of them had said\nWith a bunch of women and one of them had said about the white young white men who was the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her\nWhere the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leaving beat it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women to not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and have sympathy you\nWith that like just let 'em right right and they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressing them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys\nWould that going in my own head and I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also think about white women and what impulses and messages are at work on white women\nAnd um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that why do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so crowded\nAnd it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dries I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is and I said what do you mean and he goes oh maybe that's what you need to write about is the anger\nAnd as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what but suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months since\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplars of\nConstructive anger in the book historically\nAre black women mhm I'm Shirley Chisholm Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her grade hats or Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till that's not by any coincidence that smell the smoke by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice and for them to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have

for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up\nI'm protecting and uh trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader I'm Florence\nKennedy I haven't heard the name Florence Kennedy ... years and she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she ... she and she and glorious than we're speaking partners caught on the road yeah right to tell us a little bit about for a kind of\nSo Florence Kennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous for her\nTime but I think she would be outrageous shot in her demeanor and her willingness to be\nVocally pro family unapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism
