Republican presidential candidates and working for decades and conservative media\n... has renounced the Republican Party in his new book the corrosion of conservatism he condemns is former parties quote embrace of white nationalism and no nothing is meant quote and calls for us was founding defeat in the mid term elections ... is a senior fellow for national security studies with the council on Foreign Relations\nAnd he joins us this hour to talk about what do you think's going to be done to salvage conservatism and build a center right party to counteract extremism ... thanks for having me back to have you back and as we get into a discussion of extremism and\nRepublican Party and your conversion I Want to ask you first about the explosive devices that were sent to CNN and a number of\nProminent Democrats and President Trump's tweet which came out this morning suggesting that the mainstream media is false and inaccurate reporting as he described it is to blame in some way what do you make of the state of affairs\nI Am deeply disturbed by about what is going on Michael I'm not entirely surprising fact last week and one of my columns for the Washington Post I said that the social fabric is in danger of ripping leading to violence on the streets and sadly that seems to be coming true\nI think the primary culprit here because President Trump was engaged and incendiary rhetoric of the kind that we have never before seen from an American president\nI mean what does he think it's going to happen when he describes the the media as the enemy of the people are he says that Democrats are evil they're traders they want to destroy our borders and let in MS Thirteen and a rapist and killers and\nThey want to turn America into another Venezuela I mean this is poisonous rhetoric a and he also engages in vitriolic personal attacks against people like Maxine Waters and\nGeorge Soros and Hillary Clinton\nSo you know if there is some lunatic out there who has been inspired by by Trump's words to try to carry out a campaign of mass terrorism against these targets you'd is hardly surprising I mean we don't know exactly what the story with the with the bombs those ... and we have to find that out\nBut uh there is no question in my mind that Donald Trump is creating a very dangerous climate in this country which is\nVastly increasing the risk of political violence\nSince I'm a toy rhetoric is simply no doubt about that and it's also the kind of rhetoric that targets people specifically who have been targeted by these pipe bombs but you're hearing from the other side from Trump supporters that this is maybe a false flag and it's I don't know where this comes from but\nHeld up really to essentially divert people's interests are and maybe make more Democrats vote for the Democratic party or those who feel that maybe on the border that they should vote for the Democratic party\nAll of it I mean where where do you START I mean I think\nUh his presidency has been an abomination I mean he stands in opposition to so many of the things that I Believe in such as free trade such as American global leadership but it goes well beyond a disagreement on the issues ah it's basically the fact that I think he is unfit to be president I think he was lowering our moral tone\nHe is dividing our country using gauging and racism Xena phobia\nA massage any for political purposes he used his cruelty I find to be utterly repugnant or the way that he attacks those weaker than himself like Christine Blasey Ford for example while at the same time couch talented dictators like bottom you're putting in Kim Jong on a or now to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nOr you know he is the least ethical president I think in our history he has a\nPathological liar who lives on an average of eight times a day or in spreads pig lies he insights violence he dies damage to our democracy by demonizing the media I mean I could sit here all day and talk to you about uh what do I what I object to about ... what's what's shocking to me is that\nA forty percent of the population are so actually approves of him that that to me it was very dispiriting\nWell you indicated before that there's a kind of fuzzy and bargain that the Republican Party made which is one of the things that you condemn in a speak very unfavorably about to put it mildly and that was over are you talking about justices and certainly tax cuts and all of the things that have come to a passenger Trump's leadership one could argue\nBut there's also really stirring up the other ... uh and getting on their side with being opposed to abortion I mean there are real issues here that really have a great deal to do is that people don't think\nWell of course I mean he he speaks to a right wing agenda even though he violates a lot of the principles of what I Would consider to be conservatism I mean again the the kind of conservatism I grew up with in the Nineteen eighties under Ronald Reagan was pro immigration and it was pro American global leadership\nHe was getting ... wanted free trade Israel\nDoubt a fiscal responsibility support for law enforcement all these things that\nThat the Republicans have have turned against than even family values I mean it's pretty rich to me that all these other ... love Donald Trump because they think he's gonna ban abortion\nBut they're willing to overlook the fact that he is not exactly a paragon of moral worked for I mean what what what would they upset if it was a Democrat who was found to be violating campaign finance laws to pay off at playboy playmate and a porn star I mean you can you imagine the streaks of outrage from the right but with Donald Trump they don't care\nMood is with us his new book is called the corrosion conservatism why I left the right and he's appearing at the commonwealth club today at noon here in San Francisco where science to you earlier on I mean let's talk about it I mean Lee Atwater for example comes to mind Newt Gingrich a you know talking about how a full\nSay that Republicans were catering or catering to racism I thought that was a terrible slur on the good name a Republicans because I thought hey I'm not racist my friends aren't racist what are you talking about and then of course Donald Trump went and did it so clearly so loudly in a way a\nGiven I mentioned Nixon even John Mitchell southern strategy was a ray of kind of clogging\nI'm going to get there and the second button a a you know with with Donald Trump appealing so blatantly to racism know something I can no longer denied it made me realize wait a second\nThere is a much more substantial constituency and the Republican Party for racism for Zena phobia than I ever imagined that Donald Trump brought that into the open and because of that what I've done is I've also had to go back and rethink the entire modern history of the conservative movement and the Republican Party which is something that I Do in this book\nAnd I realized wait a second Donald Trump didn't spring out of nowhere that there there are these routes\nAh in in this fanaticism and there's bigotry on the right stretching all the way back to the birth of the modern conservative movement the Nineteen fifties and for example in the course of writing this book I went back and\nYou know read the works of people like Barry Goldwater and Phyllis Schlafly and I'd always thought it was a terrible liable to call them extremists even though\nVery guarded himself said that he was an extremist at the Nineteen sixty four Republican convention but actually looking at what they had to say the fact that for example of Barry Goldwater opposed the great civil rights legislation of Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty five\nThe fact that ah he called for threatening the Soviet Union with nuclear war if they tried to repress another uprising in Eastern Europe these really are\nAnd in fanatical concepts and they're deeply rooted in the Republican Party and the conservative movement I don't think that they defined the totality of conservatism because I think they're also been some positive strands of conservatism but this has really made me realize that there's always been this dark underside\nUh which was much greater than I've been willing to acknowledge when I thought of myself as a movement conservative and where's the Tea Party fit\nI think the Tea Party is part of the growing radicalized nation of the Republican Party in recent years I mean you've seen uh the Republican Party get more and more extremists going back to the Nineteen nineties really with Newt Gingrich\nFox News a Sarah Palin the Tea Party these are all steps along the way that led us eventually to the final destination being Donald Trump or at least I Hope it to the final destination because they're really scary thing is there could be somebody after Donald Trump who was even worse\nTalking to Max Boot his new book is a corrosion that conservatives why I left the right you\nWere on the right in many ways I don't want to push on the couch here but you know your father gave you a copy of National Review you or your father wrote for Sunnyside you came from Russia where there was a lot of anger at the evil empire and the Republicans seem to in many ways a pit in my eyes are\nStanding up against Russia and I have the president to John Bolton who is one of those conservatives is giving national security advice to and so forth he was very anti rationality shaken hands with putting in a\n... won't even go to the IMF treaty we spend an hour on it yesterday but what I'm interested in finding out about you is how much does it personal fit into your political views because you were very wedded to the political party largely because she came out of Russia and were refused they\nAbsolutely uh in in a lot of what I loved about the Republican Party under Ronald Reagan was the moral clarity the fact that Ronald Reagan called out the evil empire he spoke up for dissidents he said Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall I Love that\nFits you're talking about going to be very also said we're bombing Russia and a few minutes which I mean there was a sense of I think\nReagan was actually fairly uproot and in his use of force he didn't go around starting wars he certainly wasn't gonna risk World War three and\nAnd one to Reagan's great credit when he finally how to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he could work with he understood that he could cut deals with him that he could in the Cold War with them and a lot of right when there's a very opposed to that so Reagan was a lot more moderate in office I Would say than some of the campaign a rhetoric would lead you to suspect\nBut the irony here is of course Ronald Reagan was standing up against the evil empire and now\nA Donald Trump is is ... to\nAh to the successors or the evil empire I mean he's saying that uh that putting as a strongman he never criticizes putting he says that he is in love with Kim Jong un who is one of the worst human rights violators on the planet\nHe has very little negative to say about the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who in all likelihood was responsible for the death in December meant of a journalist just recently uh to me this is a complete\nLoss of of the Republican Party has completely lost its way\nThat the president also says I'm a naturalist and he said you know I'm looking out for America's interests America First all that kind of argument and essentially that doesn't hold water with you\nWell that's very frightening to me because we all know what the connotations of nationalism are in the modern world this is the ideology of people like ... and ... and I think\nDonald Trump knows that as well just as one he said that his foreign policy was America First he was invoking the failed isolationist than in in in de facto pro fascist\nMovement or in in the late thirties early forties to Charles Lindbergh in going back to Charles Lindbergh he is\nPlaying with some very dangerous historical forces I never thought I Would see an American president embracing America First embracing nationalism or engaging in this kind of vilification or the opposition party incitement to violence demonization of minorities\nI mean these are very very dangerous trends we've seen in other countries\nWhere

run accident no other details it's being recorded south down to eighty at seventh street on ... for Kiki weedy\nWhat are the most precious things he said was I could shoot somebody and said that and the supporters of mine is based in mind would not do anything\nExactly I think that's exactly right but remember not a hundred percent of Donald Trump supporters hardcore on about forty percent of the country supports Trump I Would say about thirty percent of that is\nA thirty percent of the public is really hard core Trump supporters people who are very enthusiastic about him but they're also people kind of hold their nose don't like him so much but say the economy is going great so\nYou know reluctantly I support him or I don't like the Democrats I think what's going to change their minds is not anything I say or do although I'm trying my damn this then you know five any credibility as a former Republican and a lifelong conservative which I Hope I Do and I'm saying you know vote democratic I Hope a few people will be listening to that but\nYou know I'm not so conceded to think that what what I say personally is going to necessarily change the minds of a lot of Trump supporters I think what would change minds however\nIs if you see an economic downturn I mean the fact is\nChanged minds however is if you see an economic downturn I mean the fact is that the stock market is down for the year housing prices are down a lot of economists are predicting the recession by twenty twenty and if that were to happen I think it would be catastrophic for Donald Trump standing\nWhen we thank you for the call or here's a Robert who says does ... think that President Trump is a fascist we spent some time yesterday with Jason Stanley who is your professors written a book and fascism and uh [noise] pretty much a outlines a lot of things that make for fascism pretty well academically but making a lot of sense from your perspective\nYou know I think you can certainly make that case in fact I think it was in the fall of twenty Fifteen when I actually tweeted Trump is advocating fascism and I think there is a lot of truth in that I mean when he says I Am a nationalist I think that's basically a code word to suggest that is the direction which he is\nWhich he is headed I mean of course you know you can always argue about it because fascism doesn't have any exact definition that everybody agrees upon but you can certainly see a lot of it with a demonization of minorities the cult of personality the incitement to violence these are a lot of the classic characteristics of fascism\nAnd do you see him you see Donald Trump exhibiting those uh I mean the the good news here of course is that\nAmerica does not have a weak political system like Italy and the Nineteen twenties or Argentina in the fifties or Venezuela and the two thousands\nOr so even if you have a president who is basically a fascist we have a much more robust liberal democracy with much stronger checks and balances so I don't think he's actually going to succeed and implanting fascism here but there is no question that that is the direction which has sympathies lie\nI guess is Max Boot his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left to right and here's a tweet from Aaron is as a reason some Republicans don't like Trump is because he puts an ugly face on their ugly policies aside from Trump's disgusting character and idiocy he has largely been a rubber stamp for every policy an appointment Republicans of wanted they want\nTo pass these policies but with a nice face on it\nAnd Joseph says so name a few conservative presidential candidates could run the table and the next election like Trump did in the last one I don't like the guy but he gets done as there'll be Jason at least these are SOB\nWell I think we all agree that he's not so big anyway um I I resist the notion that Trump is just a normal conservative I mean I think that there are\nSome conservative policies that he is implementing for example the tax cuts and the judge is I think any Republican president would do that\nBut I think Donald Trump is really redefining conservatism he's very different from Ronald Reagan for example who I again was pro immigration he never Reagan celebrated immigrants he didn't demonize them Trump is a populist he's a nationalist he's a clause I fascist I think he is redefining the ... the Republican Party along those lines\nBut he's getting things done that's the point of that color I mean a lot of Republicans see it that way and that's why they fall on in life you can as a day\nI don't I don't know what he's really getting done I mean\nThe two big things that he's gotten done from the Republican prospective are he's cut taxes and he's gotten conservative judges appointed okay\nBut he does not have a lot of achievements other than that and a lot of what he's promoting\nAre things that Republicans used to oppose like protectionism terrorists by the lake tariffs those are tax increases on the one hand he's cutting some taxes but he's also increasing taxes and you're seeing a lot of companies right now talk about what a big hit to the bottom line is Tara socks and how that slowing down the economy so\nYou know I think Republicans are fooling themselves or they think Trump is delivering some kind of conservative agenda\nThere was a color from Texas who dropped I Would have liked to have gone to him essentially he said\nUh I'm a Trump supporter and the reason I'm Trump supporters I wanted to throw grenades at all this uh [noise]\nTerrible stuff that's going on in Washington I mean Trump did feel a lot of people 'cause he said I'm going to drain the swamp a turns out to have his own swamps because besides him only use filling up the swamp but there were a lot of people who felt that way he's a disruptor we liked disruption\nI I I find that to be just perverse and it it complete misunderstanding of America\nHistorically and comparatively in the world because yeah people have always been unhappy about what's going on in Washington and I've been very unhappy about a lot of things in Washington but we need to keep things in perspective America is still\nA a vibrant democracy we are still peaceful uh buying large\nCrime is very low or the economy is going very well uh we you know we we live by any historical standard in a very free and secure society that's what what Donald Trump inherited in twenty Seventeen\nSo this notion that we somehow to blow everything up and everything was terrible that's just ridiculous that's nonsensical in Donald Trump and the notion that Donald Trump would actually improve things is absurd because he is a swamp creature himself\nHe is actually a ... probably the most unethical president in our history he is full of conflicts of interest you will not reveal his taxes he was engaging obstruction of justice\nOr he lives in an average of eight times a day so the notion that somebody like Donald Trump\nPretty good they figure the eight lies a day of Washington Post fact checkers Glenn Glenn Kessler keeps a running tally it's an average of ... thought it was higher than that but let me get some more callers on the go to Steve Steve you're on\nYeah Hi um this is a I I I ... the Republican Party left me a long time ago but ah yeah the Republicans were born out of the ashes are the wigs ripping Scott so written written today all brace Donald Trump\nUm you know where is there some kind of geographical next is that you know where we see the rise of this great center party that we've all been waiting for\nWell I don't know if there is a geographical nexus and I think one of the difficulties in American politics today is that there are a lot of moderates and centrists but they're spread out and there's no there's a critical mass of Trump voters in red states there is a critical mass of democratic voters and blue states\nSo Trump voters in red states there is a critical mass of democratic voters and blue states\nAnd there's a lot of disaffected independence and all those places I mean the largest political party in America's actually people who are not affiliated with any political party that's about forty two percent of the population Democrats are about twenty nine percent Republicans twenty seven percent so there's a lot of people who feel like the political parties are not representing them\nBut our system is basically gained in favor of the two party do awfully and politicians in both Democratic and Republican Party has a major incentive to pander to their base they're afraid of losing primaries so they they want to go\nOut to the right or the left and so now you know somebody who's on the center right I feel politically homeless\nThat's the big I'm told that Trump has in terms of turning Republicans or to drink the Kool Aid is you put it his knew that he has his base they're afraid to debase could actually make them lose their job\nYes and that's why you have no right and that's why no politicians in Washington are brave enough to stand up to him because they can you can see you of any terror greater than losing their job and so they have given up their principles in order to keep their jobs I think it's a disgrace that more Republicans have not spoken up for conservative principles\nYou were pretty disappointed in Rubio especially it seems you thought he was a principled guy\nI was I mean I was a foreign policy adviser for senator Rubio's campaign an eye\nThrilled to him when he said that Donald Trump was not qualified that he was a con man you should not be handed the nuclear codes and as I write in the book I was literally cop smacked when when Rubio went from saying that the saying I endorse this con man I mean how can you possibly do that but it was so common\nOr I mean you start with Ted Cruz for example who called Trump a pathological liar\nWho said that uh\nYou know the the worst things you can possibly imagine about him and then went on to endorse him it was just literally embracing him a few days ago and he was then you have to ask do these people have any principles\nWell in fact all the stuff that Trump said about uh Cruz's father and the rather egregious besides the sixty said about cruises wife and yet you know he's supporting cruise now he's author of campaigning for Cruz it's\nUh it makes you really wonder where the principals are as you said this show or if they're already to begin with who shows up as soon as I challenge Max Boot unaffected Seventy percent of the public supported the Iraq War this figure is correct but only after the media and the government lie to the American public to convince them that Saddam Hussein was part responsible for the nine eleven attacks\nWell I don't think the the uh the government or the responsible media was claiming that Saddam Hussein was responsible for nine eleven some people may have thought that I think with the current was saying was that he had weapons of mass destruction a nuclear program\nAnd I don't think that was a lie I think that was in misjudgment on the part of the CIA as well as other western intelligence agencies the critical\nMisjudgment but even if you believe that he had WN deep development as\nAs these intelligence agencies genuinely did that doesn't necessarily mean you had to launch a preemptive war against them in here I plead guilty because I was certainly one of those people who was making the case for that prevent of conflict and in hindsight I think that was tragically mistaken I was wrong\nAnd it's taught me an important lesson about the limits of American military power and though I mean I still believe in American global leadership I'm certainly not somebody who's going to advocate a preventative war anytime in the foreseeable future\nTake for personal family and financial protection at earthquake authority dot

later this hour we'll be talking about ... see on the San Francisco about it would raise grocery seat taxes on the company's in San Francisco earning fifty million dollars or more\nMoney that would be used for homeless services but we begin with San Francisco district attorney George ... this week he announced he was using a two million dollar grant to begin reducing the San Francisco jail population it's just the latest in a long line of criminal justice reform he supported which makes him something of an outlier among California da\n... recently decided not to run for a third term as district attorney citing the health of his Ninety year old mother who lives in Los Angeles\nAnd George ... joins me here in the studio welcome back to form like good morning Scott how are you doing well for I have to ask you I Know you're from Los Angeles you or your mom lives there ah you live do you work for the LAPD rooting for the Dodgers you know what I'm\nI'm going to take the fifth one that one\n[laughter] actually I I I'm quite partially the giants as well I think sometimes you can have a split loyalty out we'll leave it there let's talk about that\nGrant the two million dollar grant from the MacArthur Foundation um it's no secret that the jail in San Francisco the one in eight fifty bride hollow justice there has been in bad shape for a long time or you know is the situation there and what you're going to try to do with the ... yeah and\nAnd you know let me begin by saying you're absolutely right I don't think anyone that understands what the whole justice looks like will will say that that it doesn't need to replace I think we all need to be out of there including\nA that people that are into jail um middle unsafe in terms of like a health condition it health conditions systematic I mean the the building is frankly if it were if it were owned by a private enterprise the city will probably would have shut down already right so we all need to be out of their ... the question to me\nIs the question of public safety right or if you look at what is driving our crime in our cities mostly is room by ... repeat offenders are often people that are mentally ill that had drug addiction problems and we have a fairly antiquated criminal justice system\nSo for me the worst thing is not whether to build the Jill now because eventually some type of facility will have to rebuild but the question is what kind of facility we have to build and\nThe answer to that is not very clear today you know we we know what the drivers of the population are our primary drivers of the population or people that are coming in for shore states that are coming over and over and over again\nAnd that's the system failure too many rights are those like parole violations or no or you know and it could be part of that but it's usually drove mental health\nWhy do you think and they said a moment ago you're somewhat of an outlier in California among district attorneys on a lot of these policies why do you think other da ... same realization that you have\nWell look I think we all come from different places right I think that if you look at the the majority of the district attorney the majority of lawyers come from you know fairly privilege a background so there's nothing wrong with out okay by the way I I I I'm not against money\nUh but you know I came from a poor background right I I can invent yeah him again but I you know racism really rough neighborhoods in LA or in in ... I saw that the kids that are hanging around with how they were damaged by that process so for me\nAh you know the the connections with what is wrong with the system we're very personal\nDid you ever think boy and a couple of different decisions you could have been on the wrong side of the law\nOh I'm question well listen I Would not want to be judged by by the worst moment in my life when I was Fifteen or sixteen years old I don't think any of us went through by the way but yeah yeah\nAll right let's go to the phones and we'll begin in San Francisco with Rosie around with da ... welcome\nWhat kind of get my I my question is I'm a criminal defense attorney and gets quiet and all the time is working on domestic I guess got her in court arguing for how long they increased\nThe pre trial and in and out here and just getting ready to get my question is why why aren't you correct your speaker is kind of ... ... ... ...\nYeah roast a good question I'm at the numbers by the way I understand you're you're looking out at the trees I'm looking for is I'm not saying that you may not have incidents of where perhaps we may be arguing for more detention where you may disagree with us and I might even agree with you not knowing the case\nBut but what I look at you know when I'm looking at the entire forest was driving or Joe population or Joe population has been driven a bike you know frankly but people that are committing pretty serious crimes\nAnd are being held there too long or people that are mentally ill have substance abusing or waiting for a deal treatment beds the the shore states\nUh do have an impact but but in the overall numbers are is a very low number ... we really need to to to get to the next level we need to look at the serious stuff and by the way\nWe have Laura Joe populations have been ... around Twenty one hundred daily to about Thirteen hundred or so we've done a bigger reduction that that almost any other urban county in the country or I\nRose thanks very much for the call let's go now to ... and Jeremiah welcome\nHi good morning how you guys do today good thanks how are you\nI'm a great uh I just had a just to kind of cynical or dead or all of a thing I wanted to mention one was I barely see the fighter programs of oddly you [noise] you know working with like a law enforcement or\nI don't let that go drive along or whatever but um that is one thing I kinda I don't see any more I'm I'm not sure how much the ... the justice system even working with these type ... you know people who need you know\nSome kind of dry mentoring and ... one of those persons you know I bought in the air sixty or that the president you know the software engineer I taught that\nVoluntary you know but I'm also an immigrant you know I did that in my country I don't see it here in the United states\nI don't see that over here I think that's something that would really work yeah\nSponsorship indicate the lady live stream thanks Sandy from Comcast extending the Internet delivers in home life high for all the right now\nI'm not sure how much the the justice system and even ... you know people who need you know some kind of dry mentoring and got one of those you know I've been there six years that the ... you know the software engineer I taught that\nVoluntary but I'm also in the ... you know I did that in my country I don't see it here in the United states\nI don't see it over here I think that's something that would really work yeah ... ... ... ... they want to mention is\nWith the law enforcement a flood that also have issues when it comes to matters and whenever I come in contact with police letter it all back to where it seems like law enforcement don't want to touch the issue\nEven to quit as well take the oil police enforce it they push it back to the court\nOkay let me just hold let let's have a George ... responded to yeah yeah I Know of\nCourse a ... there's no question that you know we we could use more mentoring and and more ah programs to to rub herself around youth especially youth that are at risk and that is always one of the things that\nUh you know frankly we fall short of of course that's not that's really ... it larger policy one conversation that you know unrelated to a jail system is more you know what do we do in our schools water we do with a after school programs you know and and that kind of support\nAnd I think the other one if I understand you correctly is kind of the diversion of civil matter is ah or or you know so low level Madison to police directing people's civil matters in court a ... I I'm not sure what the answer for that would be because I Would need a little more details on your what what your question was are\nAlright Jeremiah thanks very much for the call hopefully that was a health for responding to your question you don't want to go back to what ... said a the a defense attorney that called earlier and I wonder you know there was the case of course very\nNationally celebrated a case if you will I keep dialing murdered a by an undocumented immigrant who's ... in San Francisco Trump made a big issue with that um and he was acquitted of all charges except I think a felon\nPossessing a gun and you end the deputy da and that case went for\nA first degree murder which many thought was really a ... I mean does that uh is that a case do you think of what she's describing and maybe out of sync with what maybe you\nBelieve or as a ... you know as the da\nYeah well I I don't think so look I mean we we can obviously always do better and we do look at our cases especially big cases and look and try to analyze work work and ... where would we have done better if we have to do it all over again\nWhen we charge a murder case basically we we charge the case um and and then we allow the the the uh the court process to to give us an opportunity to explore what the evidence supports a\nThere is no question in my mind that given the information that we had the time and given that the Taliban to the facts\nThat that case was was properly filed\nA the agreement or disagreements to the degree of murder where there should have been for a second or manslaughter a I think that you know we can look in retrospect I'm probably come up with different different approaches\nAre but the case was presented to the jury for all three theories of murder right first second and manslaughter and the jury or you know a evaluated the evidence and determined that it was not those whom we respect that yeah\nI got a a comment here from Julie right so why did the district attorney refuse to file\nCharges against the officers who shot and killed Mario woods and Luis ... and other individuals they know this has been a very volatile issue not just in San Francisco but you know for you in particular here or there been in fact protests at your house I'm ... ... talk about that decision and a ... and why you feel that you did the right thing\nYeah you know so when we look at a case we're always evaluating what does he have missile Evans in the case\nAnd whether we can prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt right and that is true for police officers as true for any other case that we look at it and and obviously as judge said the at the moment that were making the final decisions sometimes when we go through the court process\nUm you know most of the time were proven correct prior conviction rate is very very high ... percent so most of the time we do the right decision but sometimes you know the jury disagrees with us and that's the point but\nBut ethically and legally we cannot file a case we should never filed a case going into we don't believe that we have the evidence when it comes to a a police use of force a state laws and constitutional decisions have been made\nGive or police or why breath of space to to make a decision\nWell and there was a bill as you know that a failed to get out of it get to the governor last year that would have changed those earlier this year actually that would have changed the standards for rights of weight and that you would support those changes and I supported\nThe bill and in the bill basically would have said that you are as a police officer or a law enforcement officer can only use of force that is minimally necessary in order to accomplish your job and that failed a which leaves us back to the standard uh we have now which is that a reasonable officer which is really a split\nApproach you have to see what would a reasonable officer a kind of a subject is reasonable officer would do meaning what do I think of the time that was the right thing and then sort of the the reasonable person which is an objective standard you cross that too is a very confusing way and frankly those cases ...\nAll right and that bill last surely will come back next year or so there may be another run out of maybe vision was well All right San Francisco district attorney George ... out of town out of time but uh you're still on the job for another ... have you back thank Scott thanks so much for kind of like you were going to shift gears take a short break and when we come back we'll be talking to\nOh thanks so much for me it's like you were going to shift gears take a short break and when we come back we'll be talking about proposition ... the um uh San Francisco ballots should we be taxing the city's biggest businesses raise money for homeless Scott Shafer here today communicate him stay with [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean prophecy is a bold measure that's going to tackle the homeless crises in a really comprehensive way I'm only their riches corporations are going to pay not not everyday San Franciscans who are already struggling with the cost of living and I just wanted to point out that you know my appointed opponent never brought up accountability when\nHe was pushing for all of us to pay for a failed sales tax to fund homeless services in twenty sixteen and only does he bring up accountability when the very richest corporations have to pay went\nUp to a point you know Murray said was sort of pointing out you know London read did run on homeless unless you've told us that she knows he's going to be judged on homelessness and when she's up for reelection next year what so what do you think is really at the heart of her opposition if it's not what you say which is that she thinks it's just too soon to double the budget\nYeah I mean we we we did get input from everyone running for mayor including money breed met with her shared the legislation\nOn the the legal tax before we put it in for title in summary um we had a really radically inclusive process to develop this that took over a year and had more than thirty draft and it was really carefully crafted um I Can't really speak for why mayor breed is is going against doing something that she\nUm that that would help her meet her goals and we have full faith and she'd be able to\nMake sure that money is used in the most effective way and I can't say that you know this has tremendous support when we go out to the clubs and talked to folks about it and really dig deep and the measure um all across all political lines sells for ... you know neighborhood preservation is people who\nUm I have been kind of on warring sides of things to Harvey Milk\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks sanity from Comcast extending the Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nWhen you dig down and look at it surely carefully crafted and we know it's going to work on because of the building for decades has experience I've really best practices also I just want to mention\nThat the measure is very accountable every dime is accounted for half of the funding has to go to housing it's going to has about four thousand ... households about six thousand people forty five hundred people for mental health and substance abuse treatment it's going to go upstream keep people in their homes that's what's driving are homeless crises we have thousands of San Franciscans becoming homeless every year\nWhat about justice point that this could have been done through the legislative process or did you try to get it through the border to get it on the ballot via the board\nYou know we we've we've gone that direction a lotta times unfortunately this issue is such\nA a wedge issue in San Francisco and so what we've seen is over and over again these initiatives that we try to get something going on that goes through the political process and then it just gets used for political gain and so what they do is they end up putting\nThings the end result is a is a piece of legislation that is put on there\nUm for a particular pop a politician to get name recognition in his literally designed to fail\nOn this last in June I mean you had a homeless measure that was up against childcare obviously designed to fail on before that on the sales tax we had\nUm you know San Franciscans really do not want to sales actually are really struggling to survive because it's so expensive here with the housing costs and everything else and they put on the same time an anti homeless measure saying\nWe're going to take away people's little when we do we value humanity so little they were going to rip away this little piece of fabric that they're using for protection and somehow we're also going to get voters to pay out of their pocket to help the same population so we we needed to take this rains in our own hands and we did get really comprehensive\nInput including from the chamber of commerce which\nThe entire tax structure and this is structured based on there and plus\n... of course homeless this was a huge issue in the mayor's race or have ... where did you do you feel like is this what voters want another was more services more housing or do they want to get just get rid of that but that want to look at it anymore\nI actually think that's one thing that strikes me about when we talk about homelessness in San Francisco is how much compassion there as I mean there's anger and frustration to especially as we've seen this problem really spill into residential neighborhoods away from you know the districts that quite frankly have really bad the brunt of it her starkly like district sex with the tender line market it's not the market\nUm you know element Bernal heights there is a homeless encampment under the bridge nearby that get cleared out every once in a while and like you want those people do get services I don't think that's unusual you know I think always there's going to be debate within the city about the best way to pay for it and it programs are working\nI mean I'm a little confused by the argument by some in city hall that like there's no accountability in part because of what Jennifer a sad which is that voters have a pretty clear list here where the money will go but\nAlso because we trust our elected officials to spend nine billion dollars a year in our city budget and about ... minutes of the family are tied up all the you know like why why is this suddenly you know not accounted for I mean not that to me is a little confusing and just\nSome money I don't want me just put this year because of one of the one of the arguments that are is being made is that this is gonna kill jobs in the city or just real quickly because we have mark many off actually want to bring on but before we do that just what's your reaction to that criticism\nWell look you know the city's chief economic impact report you know show them that job for a job loss excuse me of up to a hundred Seventy five jobs you know and again the city's own economic uh office of economic workforce development showed that middle class job and administrative job about chicken or the most hit by this ...\nThis isn't the sweet or executive that are going to leave their jobs bigger you know middle income San Franciscans Juncker said you know are struggling to survive and the most expensive city in America\nAre one of those who are proponents of this as I said a moment ago is a sales for CEO mark many off and he joins us now and the marketing of welcome to the program\nMark how are you there\nThere you go there you go now we can hear you yeah so you're a you're I'm doing well thank you write your support for this really has an inch somebody's changed the conversation it's really gotten a lot of people's attention and created something of a division between you and other CEOs in the city to tell us why you feel so strongly about this\nWell I Love San Francisco and I love the people of San Francisco and\nI that's actually my ... my whole life [laughter] and uh when I Walk the streets there are getting worse you every single person who lives here knows that and you can look into the eyes an arch of the homeless and you can see what's going on and credible suffered and yet at the same time\nWe have incredible wealth generation being have happening here look at my company you know we've got a hundred billion dollar market cap looked at square they've got a thirty billion dollar market out look at Twitter they've got a twenty billion dollar market out\nAnd the question is we order your pennies to help the homeless situation\nI said yeah you have no choice you know I really what we're talking about today\nYeah and you you mentioned square and of course the euro Jack Dorsey also with Twitter has come out very strongly against this and says it would be detrimental to his company or you just don't buy it\nWell it's absolutely not true at least numbers are immaterial to his finances and I can tell you this these companies are very very well on the back of San Francisco\nOn the back of our people on the back of the people who are the walk down the street the San Francisco has really been very home that have allowed rate companies like mine sales force\nWho exists but now it's time for all of these comedies to get back at scale not just be not just sales force everybody needs to get back and I'll tell you\nBe not just sales force everybody needs to get back and I'll tell you I just heard about the\nControllers report you know it was the city's controllers report that that actually convince me because in that report it said the economic impact on the city is basically\nThe minimum is it it's immaterial a couple of hundred jobs maybe but if this works it will be a dramatic impact on the health\nOf the city of that it will change the face of homelessness and it will take the life that we have\nOur on our city today off it\nEither I'm I'm the I'm Sorry to interrupt you I assume you've had opportunity to talk to a mere Lyndon breed 'em and I'm just wondering did you try to convince her to support this and and and what do you make of her opposition\nWell there's there's basically two things first of all I fully support the mayor I think she's great um I I I'm thrilled that she is the leader of our city\nYou know I Am a entrepreneur I Am a risk taker and I understand the combination of risk and money and people\nThat couldn't ... change and transformation I think this is a risk we have to take she says it's a risk which can take and look at as a political risk I understand that so that's why you're seeing all of my comments I haven't commented on her\nBecause it's a political situation for her and her supporters and you know people who are working with her\nThat has to be moved to the side let me show you what has so front and center the homeless\nThis is about Seventy five hundred people were on our streets had twelve hundred homeless families with each have our ... to ... teach on our streets\nAnd those streets have become art they shouldn't centers are mental health centers those kids those street to become their K. through twelve schools it needs to stop and\nPerhaps the is the answer because it's going to give us the funding and we need to make this happen to anybody who was against prop seat is against the homeless that's my point is already clear\nAnd just before I let you go so obviously you a little ... you know some people feel like hey you know the the tech companies have created this in large measure because of all the wealth they brought to the city and driven up our rents and cost of housing do you do you agree with that at least somewhat\nOf course look you have to understand this is one in the grid system San Francisco like every city\nIsn't immigrated ecosystem it's a symbiosis business and homeless and individual in public schools are public hospitals you know world one integrated city we all have to

your career I Want to ask you about the use of mail bombs that were sent there isn't a rationale ah where are the FBI has reported a fifty six I Believe you're old man ... say ... or in South Florida\nYou know as someone who is the brother of an elected official someone who has been an elected official described with these last few days have been like\nFor everybody um [noise] uh this is something that didn't steal instilled a lot of a concern\nAnd for folks that may be directly impacted by that one I think he sent out twelve\nUm packages are including to elected officials in Washington of course it's a major source of concern and I would say for those staffs even fear\nSo everybody is happy that they've apprehended a suspect uh my hope is that this quick apprehension will deter others [laughter] coming you know you always see these copycats in these kinds of things [noise]\nUm some months ago we had a similar situation it wasn't as politically motivated by in Austin, Texas and I was proud of the work of law enforcement there to apprehend that suspect\nSo you know my hope is that um [noise] that this is going to be ... be the end of\nThat um but my larger concern is about the ability of\nUh our president too I'm\nCalm the nation and to encourage unity instead of division we cannot hold Donald Trump directly responsible for the actions of this man you know those are his actions but leaders do have a role to play in setting the tone\nAnd you know when he starts calling\nThe\nPress the enemy of the people and some that over and over and over and uses some of the rhetoric um that hints of violence\nAnd I wanted to do what I could to ensure that\nMore people where I came from could have some kind of opportunity I did by going back and improving the education levels and improving the income levels and and making it more ready for the twenty first century and what inspired me was the difference that I saw here in the bay area you\nWrote in the book and I'm looking for the exact quote but it was something like that you were angry at when you realized the difference and opportunity between what you and your brother had versus a lot of the kids white kids wealthier families who were at Stanford ... talk about that little bit\nWhen I saw and what I write about in the book was um\nYou could really tell the people had come from\nA high school backgrounds where there were different levels of opportunity and specifically talking about the number of AP classes\nThat I think at my high school there were two or three and that you could even take and I remember people being at Stanford with twelve different AP classes and the credits for it and so you know\nThe good thing the nice thing about being at Stanford was that\nPeople respected each other and folks Saul you there as as being smart and kind of on everybody on the same level at the same time there were these differences going\nIn there um and you could tell that for all of the people who didn't make it there or to one of the schools [noise] you know you could tell part of the reason why you still have a tremendous amount of inequality out there in the in the school system\nDid it change the way you thought about or maybe you hadn't even thought about affirmative action [noise]\nUm yeah you know I I've uh\nSupported the use of affirmative action because I Do think that there is a value in diversity [noise] um yeah I Know that that also is a complicated issue obviously it's been litigated with respect to Harvard right now I think it makes sense for these admissions officers to be able to consider the whole person and that they're different ways that\nPeople can overcome a you know obstacles are but\nThere is no question in my mind that to walk around the streets of San Francisco today or of Oakland as a young black man a is different\nFrom the experience of of some other folks and that we need to be mindful still as we build out these um university classes of peoples different experience and what that can add to the learning environment you\nWere in the bay area that are really interesting time two things I mean one of the dot com boom hadn't quite happened but companies like Netflix or Netscape Google was started right around that time how where were you of\nThis sort of technological explosion happening right\nCampus literally\nI mean I was aware of it because um we're reading about some of it at the time but it was also nascent in the sense that you you had Netscape\nOr the or what he called browser out you know you didn't have\nThe proliferation of social media and even search engines I think Alta Vista\nIn the bay area that are really interesting time two things I mean one of the dot com boom hadn't quite happened but companies like Netflix or Netscape Google was started right around that time how where were you of this sort of technological explosion happening right on campus literally\nI mean I was aware of it because um we're reading about some of it at the time but it was also nascent in the sense that you you had Netscape a ... year what he called\nBrowser yeah you know you didn't have the proliferation\nOf social media and even search engines I think all of this stuff and and maybe Google was starting\nTo you as a navy around me out but yeah um\nYahoo but it wasn't wasn't nearly to the same extent that you have now I remember that the each of the the uh computer dorm rooms had these old Macintoshes and also they had each of them had one next computer\nYou remember those ... computers were bombed one of you vowing I think there was like one person and the whole dorm that knew how to operate that well\nYou're also if you're a when prop one eighty seven was on the ballot in Nineteen Ninety four and again you're immersed in your\nSchool work probably but for many Latinos in California now and the legislature and elsewhere that's how they got involved in politics was through prop one eighty seven which was anti immigrant measure that was on the ballot or at that time how where were you of that and was there organizing a and political activity at that time on the campus\nOh of course there was and there was a lot of activity in that year of Nineteen Ninety four ah [noise]\nI Do remember that in fact I remember sitting in front of um the TV and the common room the dorm room lounge or the dorm lounge and are those commercials coming on to have the grainy footage from a bagel whirling ... coming and yelling embarrassed really embarrassed I'm\n... I mean it felt like an indictment ... the tone of the whole campaign felt like an indictment of the Latino community and I'm sure that if you ask people will send back then are you as folks who supported they would say well you know they were just talking about undocumented immigrants in business with Trump says now\nBut um but the tone of it really had the Xena phobic edge to it [noise]\nAnd um and I felt embarrassed about that\n[noise] we're in a in this time of course where immigration has become such a flash points uh and it's interesting because after the twenty twelve election that Republicans did this famous sort of\nAutopsy of what happened with Mitt Romney and they decided the party had to become more diverse and reach out to more Latino and Asian Americans and people who were not white upper middle class or older\nVoters and in some ways they did respond to that I mean the number of people running in twenty twelve there was Marco Rubio and\nTed Cruz from your state uh Jeb Bush you know what what happened do you think from the to the party I mean obviously Donald Trump happened but what what do you think or has the party just completely shifted away do you think from that concerned about reaching out to people of color\n[noise] you know I Hope not because I think that it makes sense for both parties to to be engaged in trying to attract everybody and ah so I Hope not in that sense um\nYou know it has moved away from where I Would hope would be very clearly Trump is taking in the opposite direction of this is a phobia and trying to look what he's done with their care than right now and basically trying to [noise]\nTo gin up support among his base uh by using this fear of the other\nAnd um the the but the answer to that is for people of different backgrounds whether you're Latino or you're white or you're African American or Asian American you know what what gives me hope\nIs that I see a lot of people that don't look like me advocating for people to do and because we have something more than the color of our skin that binds us together it's these values of understanding and appreciation for difference and a belief that we can make our country better\nUm if we see past those things that separate is\nIn opposition to some of these leaders like Trump that are trying as hard as they can to to drive an ax through those anxieties and those potential divisions and you know people of of a good will of different backgrounds stand against that\n[noise] you know it here in California of course there are many Latino voters are especially in some of the swing districts that Democrats are trying to flip from red to blue\nA there was a report out today was in the New York times about how uh in in at least some parts of the country many Latino voters feel like they're not being\nA I contacted by the campaigns ah talked earlier with somebody from the D triple C who disputes that but you know what do you think are the barriers to getting Latino out to vote in how motivated to think Latino voters are in this or that in this midterm election\nYeah I'm a little bit hard and because the last couple of surveys on this have shown that there's an uptick here it toward the end I guess we gotta have eleven days right until the mid term um the thirty ninth congressional district has a good example of that down in southern Calif\nHead rise the retiring Republican there I had to let you know in in the south Korean immigrant\nYeah I mean you know it's a wonderful in terms of you know these these new generations of leaders are coming forward but a Latino interest there had been somewhat anemic and um and the latest gauge of that from the New York times shows that are that they're actually use more enthusiasm and people are paying attention and\nWill likely support the Democrat but just more generally\nYeah I'm convinced that there needs to be a massive and sustained effort to register and to turn out Latino voters um\nBecause they can't just be the work of of of some campaigns and a cat\nIt can't just be the work of of of some campaigns and it can't be just be done six months before the election and needs to be much more dedicated than that\n[noise] All right so we're going to take a short break and then we'll be back with who they are Castro former secretary of HUD former mayor of San Antonio and author of a new memoir is called an unlikely journey and if you'd like to talk with him about the state of politics in our country give us a call\nIt's eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six again the number eight six six seven three three six seven eight six\nYou can also email us it's forum at ... dot org I'm Scott Shafer here today for me to Kim and hope you'll stick around for more of a conversation with William ... [noise]\nIs it fair to say that uh you know maybe more can be done at the state and local level because the federal government of especially now but as in general just a big bureaucracy\nYeah well and it's the false will also fair to say that like your caller people had been working on this at the local and state level for a long time and they're dedicated to the mission and right now when there is an absence of federal leadership they are our hope\nAll right ... thanks for the call let's go back to San Francisco and Rob you're on with whom am Castro\nThank you and good morning I'm Mr Castro or this is just an opinion about uh the reason that immigration has not been reformed at the federal level and\nUm you know we outsourced a lot of jobs to lower wage countries over the years but we've also in stores a lot of jobs here in the United states through the legal immigration to keep wages low so that company\nYou know we outsourced a lot of jobs to lower wage countries over the years but we've also in stores a lot of\nJobs here in the United states through the legal immigration to keep wages low so that\nCompanies can maybe make a little bit more money I mean farm workers are a little different because a lot of people won't do those jobs but the main crux ... that the region illegal immigration has not been reformed is that illegal people will work cheaper than people that are here legally\nBecause of their status is that the reason that there is no meaningful immigration reform is just to keep wages low for companies and they lobbied Congress to keep it that way\nWell I mean I Will say that\nUh you don't often hear these Republicans talk about cracking down on the businesses that hire folks who are undocumented right I mean you hear them scapegoating the individuals who are trying to provide a better life for their children and for themselves which is understandable and it's human nature especially if they're fleeing violence\nBut you know I Would agree with you in the sense that it takes your willing companies some of which look the other way\nAnd I think that any kind of comprehensive immigration reform has to include\nI'm looking at better ways to ensure that when folks are hired a that that uh that they're documented or if you have a work program in place that that the regulations of that are followed but I Will say that you mentioned is a lot of\nThese jobs when their farm worker jobs or\nUm he numbers are yeah other jobs you know it's tough asked folks these employers who have tried to get a citizens to apply for these jobs and and just to put a fine point on it they upped the wages you know they they pay them more than they normally would\nAnd they still can't get yeah maybe like a couple of people that apply but they still can't get the number of people that they need that's why we need comprehensive immigration reform that addresses\nThe making sure our borders are secure or does it in a smart way but also deals with the fact that we have ten or eleven million people here who are undocumented\nAnd and meet the needs of an economy that we want to see continue to grow\nAll right thanks route for the call do you think that a comprehensive reform I mean there's a lot of talk from Democrats about what are Republicans need to give on dreamers and other things but you know what do you think Democrats you be willing to put on the table\n[noise] well I think um you know how we secure our border um I think ah\nWho and under what circumstances is are they always are both foreign earn path to citizenship [noise] obviously and in um\nIn negotiations on legislation there'd be a lot of action around what does that look like is there going to be an earned path to citizenship or does it look like something else I Believe that there should be in our path to citizenship because I I don't think that you want a permanent class of people here who have who cannot even if they were perfect\nResidents ever become citizens I just think that's a recipe for I'm\nI'm just unity in the country going forward\nWhat about looking at the overall limits illegal or legal immigration because there are some who say you know we should we can't really even legally ... except all the people who want to come to this country should that be on the table as part of an\nOld you always look at it they always look at the numbers of people that are going to be allowed in through the legal immigration process I think you know people often say which I can understand the sentiment behind you know you have a lot of people that say well\nLook my family came here legally week we played by the rules and if these folks want to get into the country then why don't they do that look I get that sentiment\nYou know at the same time I don't think these two things are mutually exclusive I think we can address this issue that we have with undocumented immigration but also improve our legal immigration system because there's no reason\nThat folks should have to wait you know eight ten twelve years or more\nGoing through that process and and as part of that you're going to look at you know how how many people you actually allowing that legal system\n[noise] All right let's go back to the phones and Brian in Santa Rosa your next book them\nHow high I'm Sorry I'm bringing up a the the legacy of such a shove it and uh just pointing out that uh he he looked at immigration as being a threat to the wages of his she and I did\nA farm workers and his organizing of ... so the point of view that's currently being\nThe scarf or that the Hispanic support illegal immigration and that your guest represent their interests on this leads to some extent if it's not true for people who actually want to see a wage increase and by the way\nThe cost of pick to head it was a lot of ... ... what labor at the supermarket you're paying about sixteen cents on the costs are three dollar head of lettuce is the wage for the worker and it feels tripled the wage\nYou would barely notice that cause she'll be paying an extra thirty two cents per head of lettuce and when you do that you that actually can have Americans set aside picking the heads of\nLettuce rather than having an exploited under class and do it and let me let me tell you I think\nI think Mr Castro's interest is the trust of some very greedy or a owners are of me as far\nAs lots of let's give them a chance to respond to that and I would say you know that this has been tried in states like I think it was Alabama or Georgia or maybe it's been tried here in California\nI think he was Alabama or Georgia or maybe it's been tried here in California\nOr read an interesting article I think a program from the sixties and tried to take a college students and put them into the fields of of California so I'm mean but just to be precise and the answer you directly year if we could get\nFolks from the United states who are citizens to fill these\nJobs um and if you can get these these are companies to increase their wages I think everybody sees that as a good thing\nOr it still might not a judge who's running for the you know and yeah and if\nThere's evidence there's direct evidence that they can't get these folks uh can't get Americans to apply to do these jobs\nSo I don't think it has anything to do with supporting these corporations around a lot of these farms and gets\nYou know recognizing that you already have people here who are undocumented and they're trying to provide for their family and if you have a situation where the jobs are not going to be filled by Americans than does it make sense to ensure that\nThat they can be treated humanely and that if they don't break the law\nThat there's some way that they can earn citizenship yeah I think it does\n[noise] All right thanks for the call or here's a some listener comments your Charlie asks what ideas too soon that Castro have for increasing Latino voter participation especially young Latinos in Texas where we have a very unexpectedly competitive a U.S Senate race against a Ted Cruz by ...\nIt's going to be fascinating to watch in eleven days because that go wrong is a visited every county in Texas or two hundred and fifty four of them a he has you know campaigned on trying to unify um\nCommunities instead of divide 'em Ted Cruz is not particularly well liked uh down there\nAnd nor as Trump really I mean yeah I mean for folks to know about taxes I Know a lot of\nCalifornians and especially here in the bay area I Would imagine as a former resident of the bay area um you think of Texas and you think of like this very conservative state and people have different um perceptions of it but Texas had the first or second biggest percentage point jump toward the\nDemocrat of any of the states in twenty sixteen there are a lot of people in that state especially in the suburbs of Houston Dallas Austin San Antonio and especially suburban women that have had enough with Trump and never liked Ted Cruz and the first place but maybe they voted for him\nBecause they lean Republican that are abandoning that party right now that's why in congressional districts like the thirty second which Pete Sessions represents the I Believe that the Democrat is going to beat him over there and then we're going to have a couple of other pick ups I think and with a strong wave\nI Do think that uh that the ... can be Ted Cruz\nDo you know Democrats have talked about the you know flipping Texas I mean how far realistically how far off do you think that is in a you know in a presidential election\nSo well Scott it could be eleven days away so but I mean in that actual I mean well no no I mean you know so that at first they don't know I Believe", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum
