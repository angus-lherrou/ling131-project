T. Q. anti feminist statements and racist rhetoric have some civil rights activists in Brazil deeply concerned\nToday and four and we're going to explore with both ... could mean for the future of Brazil and regional politics and joining us today is Andrea Murtha she's director of operations for North America for ... that's an information company that monitors Brazilian institutions let me welcome you Andrea Murtha good to have you with us\n[noise] I think is so much for the invitation\nAnd were first going to hear from Katie watch the b._b._c. South America correspondent who is joining us from Brazil from San Palo unwelcome Katie Watson\nHeather Hi Hi how you can be watching let me go to you first uh this is a not\nNecessarily a shock because the left has been undermined and it's a dramatic certainly departure for the politics that have rained in Brazil for quite some time\nInternally but when you look at the south America as a whole and I'd like to do that first with you and you see Argentina turning right in Chile turning right in Peru in Paraguay on Columbia it would seem that in some ways a there is not only a pattern here but uh maybe Brazil is even turning farther to the rights and all those countries with both in Iraq\n\nI think that's true I mean yes we've seen some countries who are turning right but what was happening in Brazil and feels more extreme if you like and the I mean both in our it wasn't just a vote ... was a real\nVotes against the left against Iraq as possibly both NATO support as sea lack of policy is responsible for all the ills that Brazil is suffering\nObviously the poster boy bang Lula da Silva um but\nIt's just to see the division and the hatred half that came from these elections it's just been so dramatic hair and I think that as a special case in the region\nWell there's some of course was serving a twelve year prison term for corruption and money laundering or but the left or was being blamed as you suggest for just about everything that's gone wrong and Brazil and much has gone wrong\nBut now we have someone and I I just like you're kind of character\nSense of ... most of our own self because he's been compared I think in many instances to Donald Trump is that kind of right wing populists to use allied with the ... and the religious right in his rhetoric is against gays and women and certainly are those who are\nIn the minority cats\nI'm sure you're familiar with this surgery murder and she shot or\nThe ... and shot him to death and there was a great deal of the the word celebration might be appropriate to win this went viral let me uh I mean she had children and they were in harm's way by who's mugger and so\nIt seemed appropriate for people to be maybe packing as we say here in the United states let me go to a caller and a caller from Brazil Israel joined us\nHigh [noise] yes Israel you're on the air\n[noise] yeah um I I Am very concerned about um\nI work or not particularly concerned about the privatization that might happen I'm particularly in the river cities and the health system and I'm also concerned about the role of women in society\nAnd the traditional family values is that you both and I had said that women are there like right in the workplace it's okay for them to be paid less I'm Wondering how that will play out in the country and the next few years\nYou're reaching important questions as a bonus rank you regard and under him or through your thoughts about the questions that are very serious in Brazil right now that under his regime indeed\nA Isabel soup for them you know I think it is about for calling I'm\nSo under physicians a question or it's unclear at this point what do actually tried to privatize he has an economic good rules so to speak a that is a very liberal man that does want to have a proposed a number of a liberal policies including civilization off on a very large number of state owned enterprises\nHowever there's other people are in the ensemble are that are supporting both or not they're not so liberal or I Would ... and even the military that have\nA history of more nationalistic stances when it comes to the participation of the state in the economy and we're not sure yet we checked his forces is actually going to prevail\nFlipping out of himself has been walking back and some statements that he made about the ... um he already said that he does not plan to privatize strategic companies quote unquote on voting pets are about the auto company or electric bass are public utility I'm there have been suggestions off a\nChanging the methods of how a public a house and public education are offered in the country but we don't know yet what our actual proposals that are going to be presented and definitely that's going to\nUm require a larger debate within society and even in Congress so it's not like you know any of this proposed to have a blank check to be implemented um overnight\nA and about women um there is no question that some of his statements have been detrimental to the role of women in society he has a stand up for example it's hard for a someone that hires won't lunch with them deal with the fact that you may get pregnant and have maternity leave in Brazil\nUm so I think it's important that society and Congress even becomes very vigilant about\nPotential threats to a minority rights in Brazil and even though those words I think a powerful and they do I'm encouraged groups in society that that support that kind of stands to come out I don't think that necessarily means that those rights are going to be curbed\nUh I think that it's a the role of the whole society to be vigilant now and talk to him and also there's like a ... a number of people around him that the non spouses instances of that have been working actively to moderate his positions so I guess they're going to have to uh do a little bit of waiting and seeing what actually gets proposed\nRefer to vote for the call will get on his many callers as we can get on\nWe can get an injury emerges with so since she directs operations for North American joke to and next caller is Daniel Daniel welcome\n[noise] high I I work with survival international an organization that works to support and digital and travel peoples around the world including in Brazil and we're strongly concerned about both in our election\nAnd they're really dire application for indigenous people they're both in our ... maybe anti indigent as he said Indian now they're an educated they don't speak the national language and at the recognition of indigenous land which I should add the best player to deforestation in the Amazon\nOptical typically agribusiness he wants to get ranchers gun [noise] and so when did people have already vulnerable and they're faint violence and assault from agribusiness and other actors and his election will likely\nLead to more killing more vision of land the destruction of the environment including the Amazon that many indigenous people including isolated and our contacted tribes\nThe ... that you're giving out and it's and it's one of great concern to environmental is as I said earlier in fact\nLooking at another listeners kind of question bill he says how do we stop the total destruction in the Amazon has a digital people now because that really seems to be at risk of many people's minds in teetering here in the emergency you've talked about some checks and balances are intimated that there are on a bus in our what about what the Amazon the digital population\nWell hopefully that will be the same uh the question off the indigenous lands half has been raised as one that would encounter judicial issues so he would not be not be so easy for any government to implement\nA policy is that ... the the rights of indigenous people to dedicate to land and and have those reserves I'm really protected on the Supreme Court um would definitely have a role in preventing that because they were frankly be just unconstitutional\nA we have been hearing signals from people that support person out of that may or may not come to join his cabinet are that are definitely more on pro developmental policies on such a speaking the Amazon\nAh but they have also sad that the plants are followed it for US Code\nWe may have another problem just to discuss that the the fairness and their progression up their first called in Brazil but\nUm what we're hearing so far is that they do plan to follow the letter of the law so there's you know the it's not so easy to imagine just said they apocalyptic a scenario even do from the rhetoric alone\nThere are those are definitely legitimate concerns and like I said I think everyone a civic groups and society Congress audition to share it kind of have to be vigilant to make sure that those rights are not a infringed upon\nWell there are certainly a great deal at risk here in the balance as far as the environment let me think Daniel for the call and want to get more calls but\nWhat I ask you Andrew if you have a thought about the speculation involving what might be done to my door opens on his way over because certainly both in our has announced himself as a adamant a inanimate opposition to the president Venezuelan government there's been talk about maybe an alliance with Colombia\nActing together with Brazil to essentially oppose the door or remove him\nMhm so there has been this type of conversation a what we heard publicly from the man that has been tapped as potential next a defense minister which is tied to general call Douglas ... he said that she is opposed to any direct intervention in Venezuela\nAnd that but they might adopt a ... so I think it's easier to conceive that Brazil will for example\nUm impose unilateral sanctions or closed the border or two on other measures that are not you know that they're shy off an actual a violent intervention to topple of governmental neighboring country but that we can certainly expects a harsher stance than we've seen so far\nAll right I Want to get Chris on her because she's been waiting patiently Chris go ahead\nYes for the last Fifteen Years in ... America many of the shift from a a left governments were white government\nHas been at least facilitated by the CIA sometimes like in Chile or an actual military intervention um what's the relationship between the U.S and Brazil and our active\nOr we or white wing you know political organization the United states involved in this stuff for we stand out\nSoon important question we've got a very little time left but ah want to go to you on the center remark to with the did you just bring it right up to the president or President Trump seems to be on very good relationship with the bunch when are we congratulated him and he said very favorable things about him at least that's where we are right now\nYeah we see both presidents trying to um at least a just a new closeness between visiting the United states\nAnd I am not aware and I do not think that the um\nThat political establishment or the CIA or intelligence services in the U.S had any real whatsoever individual action\nI Do know that time was an adult son had gone to both NATO had a meeting with Steve Bannon who is no longer are in the U.S government that they they deed and talk and they plan to get together in the future so there is a a likeness of mind there but I don't see any actual active role we\nWill have to leave with their own to emerge as many things to you for being with us this morning on foreign appreciated in a flash I think everything is ... and we also it can be watching and we're going to have another segment of foreign right up ahead stay tuned we're going to be talking about connections between divisive rhetoric and violence what are they will find out next\nWe're listening to the encore broadcast of this morning's for um program so the the producers are not here to take your phone calls tonight but I Hope you'll stay with us for the second half of the show after a look at bay area traffic good evening today in the city\nHere to take your phone calls tonight but I Hope you'll stay with us for the second half of the show after a look at bay area traffic good evening teddy Antony\nAnd a good evening to you have an accident in ... part of a hit and run accident onto the shoulder ... eighty right near Alamo drive but reports of debris across all lanes of traffic seen a little bit of slow traffic there\nAlso an accident in Hayward to vehicles looks like it's the right lane blocks north bound eight eighty and went in and we do have to work across the Altamont Pass both west bound and east bound much still a lot of people headed back over towards the Central Valley from the late night and we're seeing delays east on interstate five eighty\nThat road work from Greenville rode out towards ... scandal until about ten o'clock in the morning the west bound roadwork should be out in time for the morning commute schedule until or am I Am today ethnic for taking meaty\nWell we're certainly not at that stage here in America we are that this rhetoric only rarely manifests itself in somebody taking matters into their own hands and being moved towards a this sort of violence\nMost people here this authorizing a and they hear the demonizing of opponents and they understand it's rhetoric they understand it's about politics and about trying to motivate people to take political action like voting\nBut as I said in any population there's going to be a people on the fringes of people who hear this and in different ways and feel so threatened by the rhetoric\nThat they move towards violence so I don't think we're at a period of mass mobilization towards violence\nBut we are in a dangerous place\nAnd there is a dangerous place a need to be seen also just from words that are so [noise]\nUh in some ways inappropriate I mean evil is a theological profound word and when the president talks about uh the press being evil or when he talks about the reporters being evil and so forth um\nIt has an effect on very susceptible mines and has an effect on people who are maybe walking the line in terms of their um mental abilities to sort out things as you were suggesting well I think\nTo sort out things as you were suggesting\nWell I think so at at all so damages are kind of our national credo our understanding of our system works I mean the press is critical to a free society\nYou can't have liberal governance and I don't mean liberal in terms of liberal versus conservative but\n... you can have modern democracy functions without a strong independent press two whole government officials accountable\nTo educate the populace so they can responsibly exercise their franchise all these things are so critical and so when the president is trying to degrade\nThe institution of the media what he's doing Israeli degrading the foundations of American democracy it is deeply deeply disturbing\nOf course she can criticize certain press coverage in an article this story that I didn't think was fair that was an factual I think the press is open to having that conversation the president is demonizing the press as an institution\nAnd that is so profoundly wrong or an ... inconsistent with our democratic traditions\nBut evil is such a heavy word Carolyn ... let me go back to you on this I mean it's a word that carries so much connotation of power in many people's minds particularly the associated with it so it was said in with the devil loose of er and so forth\nWell there isn't any question that what this divide has evolved into people making moral judgments about each other and the president is reinforcing that when he uses the word evil calling the press evil calling Democrats evil\nSo it legitimate to people feeling\nIf you are and the other party than I Am by definition you are I'm morally superior to you and your actions could in fact be dangerous to our democracy when at the bottom line what's dangerous to our democracy is this kind of demonization this kind of setting people apart\nAs if if you are not with me you are against me and there's one of two camps and there's no way to bring these camps together\nThat's the pattern that has become the basis of political rhetoric in the last four years really\nWhat the hopeful sign is Michael we do work all across the country and communities where one on one conversations small groups of people large community meetings four or five hundred people\nAmericans of all stripes no where we've come to in our public in political discourse is wrong and they really feel the pain and the anxiety and the anger of the separation and deep divide and they actually want to do something about it\nBut they are constantly reinforced that this is the new reality we're in that we have to do things in our communities\nThat actually gives people the experience again of I can have voted for Trump than you and can have voted for Hillary but we actually could have a conversation with each other and we might even we might even be surprised to find out that we agree on a lot more than we thought we did\nSo this impulse this desire to do something to cross this divide is very very profound not in the fire extremes on the far right probably Fifteen Percent of people are twelve to Fifteen and on the far left smaller eight to ten but that leaves Seventy five to eighty percent of us\nWho know what we are currently experiencing of the ethos of our political rhetoric is wrong is on democratic and frankly is unhealthy in our lives I Want to take\nThis opportunity issues me Carolyn to invite listeners to join us ah and in fact I encourage listeners to weigh in here I Would like to hear what you have to say about this and we're really talking about the connection between\nDivisive rhetoric and violence or is that connection reel to reel

... dot org slash forum and click on the segment or tweet us our Twitter handle is at ... for um there are many things to consider in the mix here you know when you\nLook at the Trump Administration and a lot of people feel there's been too much or blame put on the Trump Administration will look back at uh the the whole notion of a telling people at a rally or you know beat up those who are protesters I'll pay your legal bills and a talking about uh\nUh the you know Hillary Clinton may be facing some people who are ... of the second amendment uh there's there's just a whole catalog here that I don't need to go through because many of you know what we're talking about her or\nThe CNN logo with a picture of a President Trump in a violent action against CNN these sort of things do have consequences words have consequences in the body slam a affirmation in Montana race against a reporter\nUh it all kinda fits a picture of many ways um but it's also something that doesn't in many people's minds\nBelieve that the lead lead directly to action so we'll hear what you have to say about this and remind you that Carolyn ... Meyer is with us from the national Institute for civil discourse and David ... who is director of the triangle center on terrorism and homeland security\nWhat is the connection between rhetoric and violence and what is the connection between particularly the great divisions that we are seeing now in our country and words or language and what are his full mentored by words and language [noise] please\nAnd what are his full mentored by words and language please feel free to join us it let me go first to a caller in Berkeley Jake you're on the air that morning\n... um yeah so ah just less once you've got now I\nI I Can't help but be compelled by the sense of the others which sort of has ruptured our country and this seemingly ... away and leave a lot of us I think hopeless because we just don't see an easy way back and so this might be a radical idea but my question to you is um\nWould there ever be a point where we could actually just eliminate party line and get rid of what we've known for the last how many hundreds of years as Democrats and Republicans and sort of remove the than others and then let people go vote\nBased on the person and the views on the political sort of their agenda as opposed to what ... ... ...\nYou're talking about maybe even defeating are so diminishing partisanship is unrealistic a pipe dream Carolyn ...\nWell that's interesting jak because there are a lot of organizations in the country that has taken little steps in the direction that you're describing probably the most significant one during this election is a group called unite America\nWho is supporting only independence all across the country and I know some listeners probably think while the independence of just another party but they're basically moving in exactly the direction that you describe Jake this is who I Am this is the principles I stand for these are the policies I'd like to see in place that I think the United states needs\nAnd I'm not about partisanship I'm not about an identity with a party I really believe that we have to come together that's the kind of ... of the candidates that they are supporting all over the country so I think your idea is not a radical idea I think it's an idea that there will be exploration of in the coming years\nLet me think Jake for his call and go to Dave next Dave you're on with us good morning\n[noise] morning a shot here\nSo I think one of the things that um and it's of concern to me it's I think the situation is not an equal situation there's nothing equal about it I think ah [noise] what Trump's doing to the environmental alone is unconscionable and I think that uh in terms of\nLiberals being strong enough to call this guy fascists which is a column for the very rich

well deputy general manager at the San Francisco public utilities commission welcome\nThank you for having us glad to have all of you and Lauren let's begin with you and let's find out really what's a on stake here and what's at stake or it's a state plan a and therefore phases of this plan we should say initially but let's we're talking really about the first phase the delta plan what is it\nYeah so I mean a lot of people that's probably just seems like another one of California's water wars but I'm going to tell you this is actually a very important step that the state is going to take\n'em you know here in the bay area we don't really think of where our water comes from but it comes from really far away it originates in the Sierra Nevada and then ... the snow melts into rivers that it makes it all the way here to San Francisco in the bay area\nThose rivers have a lot of demands on them um it it goes to agriculture goes to cities but it also needs there needs to be water in the river for fashion this is kind of the real sticking point here\nThe situation's gotten so bad on some of these rivers that the state is writing this plan which is of water quality control plan to put more water back in those members because the salmon have declined so dramatically but as you might imagine that's creating a lot of discussion and debate controversy between everyone who needs that water as well\nWell and it's not only a San Francisco who feels they need the water but it's also the Central Valley\nYeah I mean a lot of jobs the food we eat it all comes from this water but\nWhat's interesting here is that the situation has gotten so bad that the state is starting to pull soaks into that debate here but I'm not normally been pulled into it and that senior water rights holders and we kind of had these two classes of water rights in California but essentially\nThe older your water rights the more untouchable quote unquote they kind of had been in the past right and then you or your water rights the more you're asked to cut back earlier on\nBut now that they the situation's gotten so bad on these rivers the state is calling on senior water rights holders like San Francisco to kind of chip in and put more water back in the river and and that's why this is really unprecedented\nYou mentioned the water wars before San Francisco has a separate system but it's been really avoiding the water wars to a great extent but now a crisis has gotten pretty bad I mean and profoundly serious\nYeah and so that's why they're in adulthood yes and that's why this has really gotten so contentious because it's going to set a precedent for a lot of people around the state about how we manage water not even in droughts outside of droughts I mean that's how bad the situation has gotten\nBut other places just look at San jose they've really implemented water recycling and other parts of Southern California really have San Francisco just broke ground on his first water recycling project so I think the other big question it's it's bringing to light here is where else can we get water how can they use it more\nAs yeah Southern California's really doing a compared to us a extraordinarily better job but let me and you mentioned San jose is well let me bring some more callers abort her let me go into Mendocino County and local Matt you're on the air\nUh yeah um but ... says well today I just wanted to give my own viewpoint and what's happened who grew up in the ... in ... which is north where like ...\nWe're we're at the wildlife are doing a lot trying we or that off the leash story that my grandfather just going to the river and it you know damage no problem in Wayne and the revert to the very young boy\nIt different all dried there's no standing and it's all gone and um we don't know how to get it back they don't know when they're coming back and not living up here in the wild it's just\nSometimes can be a little bit more but um it is what it is and I have a good memory and story to hold onto like remember so food for thought I I guess\nYeah and a good a personal responses ... which we appreciate hearing or the Chinook salmon by the way according to chronicle are way down from about Seventy thousand returning in Nineteen eighty four to the San Joaquin base and then twenty four teen who was at a thousand or more you want to comment on that because that's really was a lot of this is all about\nYeah I mean it's it's an ongoing crisis I think it's only in the drought that some of us tend to pay attention but I mean the state is really having to be forced to move here because it's just not getting better\nAnd we'll bring some more callers aboard let me go to San jose and welcome Christina Christina joined us\nHi thank you for taking my call I just wanted to know what about all this rain followed that we get yet when we get it [noise] um actually I like it just kind of those and back into the ocean and to the you know wherever it goes to\nActually like we don't like all the brain in this area actually we don't have to wait\nStarving doubt or maybe putting and then the right height or\nGet back to their homes or I don't know about it like maybe we can figure something out\nChristian I'm Glad you brought that up because uh we were talking about how some places do it better some Southern California I mentioned is doing much better in terms of like storm water runoff and uh let's say something about that long\nAnd yet we might go see it as well I mean I keep in mind what rains in San Francisco is not enough to feed this area and that's why we as a region get our water from so far away\nYour head or excuse me Michael sir I'm so grateful we capture in the bay area we do have reservoirs in San Mateo county in Alameda County and we capture it\nWe also have an artist in San Francisco where you have to manage and hold your stormwater on site and a lot of that is sometimes recycled at least large developments we do that in our office building here in San Francisco\nAnd I like to comment about recycle water that we don't do enough our water use who solo sixty four million gallons per day and\nWe don't have that much outdoor irrigation so the recycle water plants that were building here in San Francisco will serve the west side of San Francisco the parks the green ways and things of that nature and if you make a comparison to Southern California on a percentage basis we're right there with them or high water use\nMichael Karlan against the general manager of San Francisco public utilities commission you want to respond Peter ... Peter is policy director of the ... river trust\nWill something we agree on with us if you see is there is a real opportunity for some of this storm water capture in the Central Valley where awkward first have been over drafted so there's capacity and we've proposed that in big water years like twenty\nSponsorship as a cake you eighty life's dream come true ... any sleep are all featuring temper

hundreds and it's not just about the famine it's about a salmon based ecosystem there more than a hundred species that depend on them and they bring tremendous amounts of nutrients from the ocean and if he's upland habitat the fuel food food Web day for life soils\nAnd they also provide for a very important industry in California especially historically which is the commercial famine fishery and that's on the brink of collapse in two thousand eight two thousand nine or the season they had to be closed and it's really a this is a make or break for the salmon fishing people it's just I'm\nJust wondering because I was reading um or said a column or out of them are said a sun starting to say farmers versus fish\nWell that's a way to really simplify it but the bottom line is that there's a lot of room for efficiency in agriculture\nThe farmers that get twelve me river water they pay twenty dollars an acre foot acre foot is essentially a football field a foot deep with water here in the bay area we paid twenty two hundred dollars to make her foot so there's not really an incentive to use water efficiently and the Central Valley\nThere was a study done I'm just north of Dallas County which gets its water from the wall me where they put in a pressurized systems they could do drip irrigation they reduced their water use by thirty percent and they bumped up the yield by three percent so there are a lot of opportunities and it doesn't have to be an either or\nWell I'm going to read a comment from Tom who writes agriculture already uses eighty percent of the water the biggest water uses or almonds and alfalfa pasture and show why\nAre we growing water guzzling crops like alfalfa and pastors in a dry state like California is big ag trying to drive salmon to extinction in order to justify taking a hundred percent of the water\nWell that's a really good point and I'm In California water is a public trust resource that means that belongs to all of us and you can make an argument that if you're growing cheap food would subsidize water to feed Californians maybe that's a good beneficial use\nBut when you're exporting cropped overseas uh twenty six percent of agricultural production and California's exported overseas then you have a case where a a corporation often is taking advantage of a subsidized resource to um make personal profit on it and and that's wrong and unfortunately\nSan Francisco having junior water rights is really at the mercy of irrigation districts and in fact they even have a contract with them that they will support them on their flow measures so here we have a very progressive\nCity and earlier but said San Francisco versus the environmentalist and it's not that it's really water agencies versus the environmentalists because we polled\nA San Franciscans we found extremely strong support for protecting the bay and delta and the ... river and that people conserve water for the benefit of the environment\nAs you mentioned yesterday that San Francisco board of supervisors voted unanimously to support the bay delta plan Paolo Alto voted unanimously to support the delta planned back in August\nSo what we really need to do at this point is turned that concern for the environment into being creative and figuring out ways that we in the urban areas work with the irrigation districts to use less water ruse more crops and make sure that we can withstand a drought that we have never seen before\nWell let me go back to you Michael calling you had an alternative plan here don't you well we have an officer but I Would interject one thing right away that that I spent the past two years working with those irrigation districts getting to know them getting to know their issues\nAnd I think that's really important because we've gotten into a place where water use efficiency is is now on on the tip of their tongues\nAnd they see the future and they they want to be part of that\nAnd I think that's where we need to spend a lot of our time is working with those people to make them understand how important this issue is and how important the river as elite they're starting to get that\nThe second thing appeared match is about ... days right but we passed landmark legislation to California to protect our groundwater basis that that's going to turn that issue around as well and I think that's important\nI also think that um as we kind of moved towards the future you you talked about we have an alternative plan we do and it fits into what the state board is looking for is looking for voluntary agreements voluntary settled agreements that look just look at flow but also look at habitat rats restoration and conservation\nAnd that's what we've been doing for the past year and a half is working with those parties on the river across the state with the state government with the governor's office to try and get to those monetary settlements and I think that's the important issue and we're going to get\nTo more calls or we're going to have a about ten minutes more with our guests and let me just ask you quickly Michael Karlan the if the agency that as soon as this\nPlan passes next week we have not made a decision about that at this point in time right and when we return we'll take more of your calls we're also going to make a surely in about ten minutes or so like ... or who's going to

you're kind of the new boss in town so I think it's an appropriate way to refer to you I'm Glad to have you on board with us let's begin by talking about your priorities I mean you kind of laid it out

appear uh and uh you mentioned the third thing overturning federal policy that bans he'd be a use of drones in a fire prevention where are you on all these in terms of moving forward\nWell first off

have a disaster\nThat becomes your top and highest priority at the time and\nUm it's really unfortunate a lot of the disasters we see with hurricanes and flooding generally make CNN and Fox News and a as a result you have an outpouring of public support\nUh that's what Americans do and right now uh you know Pacific Islands are are mean I'm are very very much one of my top priorities anybody that has dealt with the people the Pacific islands or some of the\nMost humble a nice as a patriotic people you'll ever meet\nAnd last week a category five typhoon yet a tanning end in sight pan and we just played some of our emergency response folks over the weekend\nThey got to Guam the only way to get into those two islands as by military transport there are rising as we speak um and I expect probably the damage a this was a hundred and eighty mile an hour sustained winds that got those islands uh the I went went right over tiny and\nAnd I would expect that it would not be I Would not be surprised if you know the\nThe water supply will be a hundred percent knocked out the entire energy grid will be knocked out and up to eighty percent of the homes on ten in destroyed and I would just uh that's my highest priority\nI'm I'm not going there now because I get in a way but I now put it on the schedule to be there in early December just as I the second week on the job went to Hawaii to deal with the volcano um ended um we ... that I Would ask our listeners are Persian thought she'd go out to these people\nUm which is in a remote part of the world that's kind of out of sight outta mind between here and in Asia and are these people are going to be really hurting and I expect that probably you you're going to have a response from the many PA and and dealing with rebuilding for for the next year\nThey let me see even I wanted to do to shoot a because we talking about this terrible\nTerrible disasters that are reflecting on wildfires here in California and hurricanes and are you are very involved in how many people make the connection and and do very strongly to climate change and see that's what's really behind this new been\nLabeled a skeptic and a daughter and I don't know if I'm going to writing\nYour categorized what I might position wrong I never said that go on global warming is caused by human humans and human activity I've said\nThe quantity of how much from humans and the quantity from natural sources as the question mark I Know I I was mandatory evacuated twice in the Santa Barbara fire which at the time was the largest wildfire in\nCalifornia history there's been a study done that suggests that the carbon emissions from that that fire alone or will be quoted ten years of manmade production emissions in California\nUh but the bottom line is I have also said we should get rid of carbon carbon emissions for bad um and I have fully supported any global warming treaties that put India and China at the same level as us versus\nThe last treaty game Chinatown twenty twenty five to set their threshold date which almost encourages them to be a gross polluter so that they they can have a higher standard to work from from twenty twenty five\nBut I'm Out of the global warming debate I'm not a policymaker that comes from Washington I Do whatever I'm told\nBut I saw I fully support reducing carbon emissions carbon emissions are bad I just think that a lot there's been a lot of ah when you get into the ... debate I think a lot of folks will have a tendency to put a lot more for men main sources\nThere's a lot that come from Mother Nature that's all I'm saying let's let's all work together\nTo reduce carbon emissions and let's work hard to get China and India at a at the table\nWith a verifiable enforceable agreement and I fully support the United states entering into any agreement like that at any time because we can compete in in the world globally as long as we have the same standards and we're not going to solve this problem is you know what\nMakes people this is not a debate you got a Ninety seven percent of actively publish climate researchers who believe that humans are the primary cause of rise in global temperatures\nOkay well I just gave you a fire that's causing you know ten years of carbon emissions equal to what you know California will produce so what I just said is let's get rid of carbon emissions but why don't we focus on China and India\nBeing at the table with the same standards of the United states because if they're not participating and it's not enforceable if you're a true believer that it's all caused by man ... ... it's caused by man than a lot of that's going to come from India and China and we'd better bring them to the table with the same standards that are enforceable as the United states\nWhat do you have those people who came to climate change we were talking about climate change soon the planet has really thinking this is not a small amount I\nAnd I I just said let's get rid of carbon emissions but you know the bottom line is as a regional administrator like any other regional him in a straight or I don't have any say in the debate I have no\nI Am not a policymaker none

S. but there's also a lot of regulations of that market\nAnd this is really a function of a couple of trends in health care and dialysis specifically we have more patients who need dialysis we have more people aging in our country\nAnd we also have more people who are having kidney failure failure due to things like diabetes and obesity um we also had a lot of market consolidation in the ... industry to the point where we now have\nTwo companies I'm controlling about Seventy percent of the market of houses clinics in California\nUm and that's for sixty six thousand or so Californians at any one time who need dialysis and the thing about the house is is if you need it you need it about three times a week senior clinics near where people live and work and so that's really what where we are today with the valid proposition\nAnd we're often talking about a hundred privileged people or people with lower incomes people of color\nThat is true yes and what are the what are we talking about in terms of the profits\nWell um there are profits in this industry um billions yeah the billions either to for profit companies to beat out and for seniors are the ones that um have consolidate a lot of the market in California and across the country\nAnd um many people have pointed out that these profits are higher than say California hospitals have for their um operating margins and they're also regulated last and they don't have staffing ratio like hospitals in California so\nThat's sort of where the debate as as far as um hey maybe we need a puts more regulation on this industry and this would be a pretty indirect way of doing that however it would sort of look at revenue and and\nUm incentivized to dialysis clinics to reinvest some of that revenue into a patient care which could mean everything from higher wages better training or equipment\nThat's written into proper ages well\nIt's not written into the ... it's more of a function of how this would work\nThe assumption is that they're going to a clean up their act so to speak because there was a ProPublica investigation that showed that many of these clinics are really unsanitary and have terrible problems\nLow I mean that's the concern that many have above the belt and there's a big let me who you under the rug and that is a concern is that this will become national\nWell the dialysis industry has certainly concerned about that because they have monopoly pricing power not just in California but to beat him for Sunday was control Seventy percent of the national market that's but there's one simple thing here if you're a Medicare patient\nDivvied and for some years received two hundred and fifty dollars a treatment here in California if you have commercial based insurance which is where divvied and for some of us are trying to ... patients through an entire scheme that was the subject to some legislation earlier this year didn't ultimately passed\nYou're charged a twelve hundred and fifty dollars it's a four to five\nTimes Marco between a Medicare patient and a commercially insured patient that's what this was about\nThe dialysis industry for all practical purposes is not effectively regulate regulate it in California typical ... inspection is every six years fourteen hundred deficiencies among those that were inspected last year in four thousand people have died from infections in the past five years\nWe've got a lot of all of that in order to get as many as we can uh but first let me go back to Carrie Feibel because a lot of people are asking him but well like for example has defined revenue exceeding a hundred and fifty percent of the costs of patient care is released a profit\nWell it's Fifteen Percent what this ballot proposal would allow would that um the clinic operator a would be able to add up the cost of direct patient care which includes staffing and wages and then take Fifteen Percent\nThat cost um would be for overhead including profit although and how this would actually be implemented would then be fought over you know what is direct patient care does that include training for you know offsite coordinators would that be part of that would that have to be in the movies or turn out to be determined\nLet me bring a caller in and now to Cathy joins\nI [noise] I work at a not for profit in it as well as for that\nAnd I agree that a state rep that they can I can attest to the fact that there would be no guy Allen here that hair monitoring and I think it's for it are vulnerable as it is\nA you know you have four by any within ten miles each with its own medical director\nI don't know how much they're paid but I think it ever get him out in the hundred thousand dollar a year range that the uh ... they have one medical director for a ... mile range and\nNow they're quite at that money there are a lot it can be done very managers are fearful that day when they got it currently there not to work on the floor at these yeah that they could easily work that he ... hours a week\nYeah and it it could easily work that he wore and I think that would be a good thing [noise] it would allow their salary while you're at a rapid\nAll right I'm Glad you're on record here Cassie is being in favor of proposition I'll let that stand and get another caller on right away and the two Rick joined us\nI I wanted to ask about the Medicare because Medicare and everybody in my ... so I don't think this really save people money as much a\nYou know\nCarry you help us her\nWell that's the impact of this would be a mostly on commercial pairs of dial this because they they pay the highest rate you know Medicare does have a fixed rate\nBut there is a lot of movement a thousand patients uh between different pairs depending on their life circumstances depending on if they become disabled during the time they're on dialysis um and what we're talking about is the overall revenue of a clinic which is dependent on this mix of pair so\nI'm In a sense we have the commercial insurers paying much more than Medicare and Medicaid and that sort of where this is being\nThought of it as long as we're talking about the gun and go back to you David Gergen Mike writes this was a misuse of union dues if the costs are too high the insurance companies and Medicare should negotiate better who's to judge what profit margins are right or not\nWell it is too high because Medicare patient is charged two hundred and fifty dollars for a treatment and a commercially injured person this charge twelve hundred and fifty that's because of the lack of regulation and divvied on for some of us have monopoly pricing power because they've cornered the market and they figured out a very lucrative way to extract\nA hundred and fifty thousand dollars in charges from somebody that's commercially insured over the course of the year it is a predatory business model they really are the payday lenders of the healthcare industry and let me ask you for banks would respond\nTo it you know a lot of what Davis saying isn't really borne out by proposition eight and I think you know keep in mind you know your organization could have written a very different initiatives is really about patient care they would have drafted initiatives that mandated more training that into instituted quality controls\nFor example of that answer something from a listener says outright warning clinicians involved in drafting the no well yeah now yes was there a third party review of what they are going to know do yes [laughter] you know I mean there is no problem and we could be\nYou know this is this if you if this really a motive you know this we're I'm driven by pure motives this could be something taken up in the legislature is patient quality care is really such a problem introduced a bill and\nThe legislator done that and then you and and it will do that\nThe your clients have spent more money against this a hundred and eleven million dollar setting a national record for spending in a ballot campaign product they are trying to defend four billion dollars a year in profits that's what this was about that's why\nYour ... your ... going to get started out by our a health editor here or there\nThere was a third party look by the legislative analytic office\nIn ... was introduced you can't make changes to lead to an industry and and they essentially ... through the legislature which is part of the\nProblem I mean if I had to summarize this is such a new saying that they didn't have a lot to compare it to in the past and they said on the one hand if it's interpreted this way local governments will have to pay more because patients is the kind of closed patients will go to local emergency room rooms on the other hand\nThis could save local governments money um or or it's the state money in Medicare Medicaid Medi Cal payments so we know it's really unclear would be a radical experiment\nIt's important to note and I think you know Kathy continues to save the clinics will close and that's just a fabrication\nLast week the two largest insurers and California Kaiser Permanente an anthem in a report to the Los Angeles city employee retirement system said that passing proposition eight would have no effect on access\nThis is fear mongering of the first degree it swept shoot the messenger let's scare everybody let's spend a hundred and ten million dollars but the people who are responsible for making sure dialysis patients get their services are saying passing proposition eight does nothing to access but we will stipulate it does a lot to reduce windfall\nPrior to that question are very sad for the airlines I heard from your mom McAfee but let me go back to carry through the legislative analysts say the clinic's front claws\nWell they don't that's not how they do their reports they just look at what's impact on local government and they basically had to say this this could be interpreted\nThrough regulations if it does pass in a couple of ways uh if it's interpreted very strictly clinics might close but we can't predict what these companies will do if it's interpreted this other way that's more um you know\nHelpful to you know how they define what direct patient care isn't clinics might not close and we might look at some savings for government so they basically kind of said we can only look at this limited scope things we're not sure\nWe've ... seconds left I Want to give them to you can see for banks because we started with Dave go ahead\nI'm the legislative analysts use the phrase unclear uncertain difficult to understand difficult to interpret ten times it and then so now says which underscores\nThe sloppy drafting how difficult this has to do right the need for oversight maybe through the legislative process if that's the way you want to go on as it relates to Kaiser anthem I'm Dave misstated what was said in that report it was for the LA county employee health care system it's a public agency\nPublic agencies aren't affected by proposition ... we will have or leave it there it's up to the voters now thank\nYou both for being here thank you Kerry and or\nOther segment coming up we're going to have some fun are talking about science with science journalist Matt Simon whole about body centers the ...\nTalking about science with science journalist match Simon hold out bodies centuries the end I didn't realize zombies stay too that's very [noise]\n\nIt was just coming up tomorrow on foreign as part of our twenty Eighteen election coverage we talk with secretary of state Alex ... about his reelection campaign then attend residence at a small town of Brisbane which lies along the San Francisco bay north of the airports\nAre set to vote next week on whether or not to build desperately needed new housing along someone use for morale yards will debate the measure which is being closely watched across the region and for the latest updates on our programs and guess\nPart of the manipulation of of the parasite is to first of all\nItself as the virus in the saliva of foaming at the mouth as we all know that the present from rabies 'em by the manipulation of the viruses part is to keep the host from washing out that virus so the manipulation is don't drink water not only that be afraid of water so if you find videos of his mind you can see nurses handing\nA cups of water to patients that are in fact with rabies and actually ... um they're they're terrified of it so it's\nAnd it's a you know brains intro likely that any ... again it's like talks apartments not a virus or or pathogen that ... to ... manipulate us but other mammals and it just so happens that we have these ... and we get manipulate most of us do yeah well we would like to think so sure\nAh the ah is it but if this really reminds you that we are meets were made of meat like every other organisms\nReminds you that we are meets were made of meat like every other organism we think that we have these great big anthrax these wonderful egos in consciousness in free will but at the very base of it it is this pure biology that these parasites or manipulating\nYou're not a great believer in free will and I was like a the ocean remember when I interviewed Nobel Prize winning ... author of ... very seriously Mr senior you believe in free will and he had no choice [laughter] you do have a choice here saying\nFree well there's not very much when we're talking about all this uh this occasion and the natural world\nWhen you look into as many parasites that our mind controlling the house as I did you get to thinking that um there's this really profound question\nOf wind is an animal that is infected with a parasite like this that is manipulating behavior\nStop being that animal rights so you have the cockroach that has been stung in the brain um at one point to stop being a cockroach and start being more of a parasite the parasites behavior manifesting in the cockroach so your\nI like the example use about ... an aunt ah [laughter] we were talking about actually a phenomenon where I'm a fungus can get into an aunt and literally order it around having to do whatever it wants\nYeah and that that's a ... it's interesting that will because this is a fungus that grows and the body of the ant and can make up fifty percent of its weight or by the time that it has completed its manipulation and drove in driven it to a specific spot in the rain forest\nWhich by the waste ten inches off the ground it always happens around noon these extremely precise manipulation\nBut if it's drawing to half the body weight\nAt what point does the ... stopped being an aunt and start being kind of this hybrid organism and then you start to think about well you know if there are parasites that are clearly working on our brains how much of our behavior can we talk up to our brains and how much of it might be the manipulations of\nA bad actors in our heads it's terrifying I think I'd almost rather not\nTequila that Simon a science journalist for wired and author of the plight of the living dead and uh [noise]\nWant to hear from you our listeners so any gross creatures you fascinated by our questions you have about ... zombies uh they walk among us and buzz among us and crawl among us and uh I was a it may even talk about the depiction zombies in the movies compared to what we see in nature because it's like night of the living dead when you get into met Simon's\nVision of things are and you might want to talk

D for them\nYou know this gets back to neurons in so many ways um in many years ago I had the great privilege of interviewing Francis Crick and he'd written a book at the time about how we're all neurons I mean again it gets back to your notion that were\nMaybe compelled by forces of nature as well as our own neural patterns much more than we like to recognize or believe\nYeah and you know they've done studies ... imaging studies where they have shown that your brain is making a decision several seconds before your consciously making that decision before you're even aware of it that's horrified me I don't like that but you know it makes a good amount of sense for the brain to be\nOn auto pilot because we don't think about every single thing we do\nDuring the day just wouldn't be efficient you\nGet up and brush your teeth and say I'm going to start the top left\nMy mouth and go to the top right now you don't do that that just because there's so many automatic things we start to think about\nHow much of your day you don't really think about and you're on this kind of auto pilot and then where do you begin drawing the line of at what point does the behavior get complex enough say deciding to\nYou know assault somebody and you have to go to prison\nOr but you could argue also that well you know there might there be this absence of free will because we are all firing\nNeurons we of course have to believe in free well because our society would break town without it you have to have people be responsible for their actions but it's really interesting to think about these parasites manipulating behavior how might they be turning us into not just humans but something kind of a hybrid and our behavior\nHalf of the organisms out there and there's so much yet that we don't know I mean in terms of what we're talking about here mine controllers obligation or all of the things that you bring up here and a\n... actually at one point kind of speculate and this gets back to your role as a journalist for wired a mind control in terms of a social\nMedia yeah I think that's a really important question that we need to start thinking about more I think we have begun and that's largely to the fact that former social media executives are coming out and saying oh hey ah sorry at all [laughter] we specifically designed needs to be addictive and that\nComes down largely to doping mean which is a a chemical that makes us social that's I mean it's great for human survival we need to stay in packs\nIn order to survive that we'll be frail\nBoring bodies or that need protection but these pathways dumped the pathways are continuing to be exploited I don't feel like people want to get on Facebook or Twitter they don't like oh man I really want to spend\nAn hour of my day today continuously scrolling through and now there's a term for it which is obvious growing continues he's going through my feed is that something you're really choosing to do or is that doping mean ordering you around\nWell the science or I mean she gave me the history is there they've used the science all along a almost from the beginning and let's go to our callers and let's begin Tula with you that morning\nI'm ready to carry on I was a heavy I got out of the largest Robert ... and you were talking about\nEither beyond just Robert ... and he was talking about ... Harris I could talk for a partner\nThat found in um ... and a study that you get that\nShows that the higher now at this parasite is really present in like something like Ninety percent of these corpses of exotic sports car drivers and motor cyclists tree gotten in a crash and I ... a currently it increases your behavior and make some people more\nUm you know less risk adverse and I just wanted to get a um [noise] at least they're trying to hurry up on this parasite attacking basically but human personality from contact and I understand pretty common I\nWell I've known a lot about supposed these were but I've never encountered that uh can you shed some light minutes on\nThat is just too busy I had not heard of that specific study but there is an anecdotal story about a doctor who was working in yard as can be a couple of decades ago\nWhere he said listen to you have a male motorcycle accident victim come in um test him from talk so plasma and you will more than likely find it in his body\nUm because of that is tied in a lot of these studies have shown it is tied to risk taking behavior particularly\nIn men are in in women has been tied to suicide rate it's also schizophrenia and also schizophrenia and ... and ... and we're just begin to understand how schizophrenia comes about\nIt's extremely complex disease obviously an end it's not like you have talked a plasma you automatically develop schizophrenia their relationship to between suicides yeah yeah yeah very much so and and\nSo you know uh it's not what's so fascinating is that this aren't these aren't they have no modifications that involves for the parasite the ball to exploit rats in and get them into bellies of cats in Baltimore ... us but it's fascinating to think that well it's doing something to our brains as well\nAgain we're just meet like everything else in nature we've got to stop thinking of ourselves as as this wanted special species\nAs long as we're talking about cats stay she wants to know you think that's a parasite in cats can explain why some people who are cats\nThan that it's been speculation in the field there has not been a steady yet to show that uh you could maybe do an amateur study if you wanted [laughter] nobody has yet explored that on a scientific all his emerald emerald you're on good morning\nHello good morning dairy and just go ... I got sick eating all out\nI Do a lot of people are familiar with that I think you gave them off it just the easiest thing to remember a lot of places your child or a movie at obviously what by by now but\nThere was a horror movie a cop that day where the Laos electric mutated by the the chicken blah blah blah it essentially the town that human beings and then took over their body than it sounds like matter\nThey had a bunch of picture than things up like eating lousy lousy that we're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "31"}
