P. Morgan executives from Blackstone Group deciding not to go to the big conference that was about to be held in Saudi Arabia\nAnd that may seem like a small gesture but it does show that there is a tremendous amount of dollar influence that the United states might exert in this case and as you say in President Trump's case with those arms deals\nUltimately while the president has a tremendous amount of control over that kind of thing and the selling of arms to other countries so does Congress and over the weekend we saw not only Democratic senators but also prominent Republican senators including people like Marco Rubio staying in no uncertain terms that they took the disappearance of ...\nAs a serious moral stain on the United states if we do not take it seriously and if we do not retaliate\nSo what do you think it's more a congressional pushes and ah all of the leaders who are going to participate in this conference call Donald is in the desert that was set to take place with a\nSome pretty high flying a executives and you mentioned Jamie diamond people is that a status I mean what what is pressuring the president more do you think\nThe president is obviously president of the United states in Washington DC and has to deal with Congress that other branch of government that he has only somewhat tentative control over\nBut ultimately the president is a creature of Manhattan he is a creature of the New York world he understands Wall Street he understands Wall Street pressure and while he may not be the favorite person of Wall Street at many times Wall Street has considered Donald Trump something of a pariah\nWhich has to turn out or voters of color in that state who overwhelmingly support her and she'll win and look at look at um\nAt the Democratic party in Georgia has the biggest uh kinda vote protection program with the hunter feels staffers than they've had in their whole history\nAnd Stacey Abrams campaign is not predicated just on new registering but getting people to the early which they believe will overcome this voter suppression so if you look at the numbers today's the first day in person early vote\nFifty two thousand people have already voted more than twenty fourteen and forty six percent of them are people of color so\nIt ... what's happening at drank campus playing the suppression card and he's trying to prevent mostly people of color from exercising their democratic rights but the Abrams camp is really trying to do an end run around that undemocratic a strategy and ... seems to be winning\nAnd on the other hand Scott will show the Republicans there are saying and I'm not only talking about the governor count a but those who are as backers rhyme Mahoney who's running the campaign and others they say this is to eliminate voter fraud that's the real concern and keep the integrity\nOf the election well they get a step further a camp is the secretary of state he has a constitutional obligation to enforce the voting laws that are a political and Georgia and he is enforcing those laws\nWith regards to people not being allowed to vote\nThey're not being purged from the rules that's just not factually correct I'm\nStacey Abrams is a very attractive candidate she's motivating a lot of people to come out to vote but you know so that heat at this point across that he ... up to right now by the latest polling comes up by two points so fifty thousand votes actually could matter or in a race that's that close but they're not being purge they're not being blocked\nUm the bottom line is um should resign absolutely not he's just he's a constitutional officer and secretary of state in ... why should he resigned for enforcing the laws of the state and the and the truth of the matter is no one is going to be denied\nA ballot so if you go in and actually presented id you can vote there on the spot even if you can present an id you can get a provisional ballot and vote in that provisional ballot once verification is dumped so\nUh you know this is really about politics are really more so than anything else so again asking a secretary of state to resign and when that's his constitutional job to do\nI just think it was you know again raw politics\nHow do you see it Ron Elving this voter suppression issue has been with us for a number of years many many years really and uh it has intensified as we come up to a close election\n\nSorry we seem to have dropped around there and let's see if we can get them back immediately but in the meantime let's go to these races let's talk about uh it seems almost a preconceived notions just find that if Democrats turnout they will indeed take the house or you feel about that show in Las Vegas so up for grabs in your mind\nYeah we'll historically speaking since the civil war there's only been two races where um the party that was in power in the White House didn't lose seats so you know talking to the folks that I Know that have been doing this for for decades they believe right now the Republicans are in jeopardy of losing the house probably between ten and Fifteen seats [noise]\nAh they were feeling very very ... in June and July but since uh a cabin on be more significantly some of the Democrats making the comments\nAlmost sixteen million voters from the rolls we don't have democracy in America anymore right Sean your thoughts are on\nPeople who have been in some sense or another removed from the rolls sometimes people who are given an additional burden devoting can still vote and this is of course\nThe defense that's being made a in Georgia that people can still show up and they can still file a provisional ballot they can still come in and and argue their case uh this is what's called in a lot of the decisions that have been handed down in federal courts at least at some levels of the federal courts\nOf this is what's called an additional burden on a voter you're telling people yeah you can still vote but we're going to put you through some hoops we're going to put you through a little bit more of an interrogation when you come in and I think that's something that people can be\nFamiliar with a recognize from our voting past certainly in a number of states where people were required to jump through a lot of extra hoops just to try to register to vote for many years that was outlawed by the voting rights act\nBut we have had a certain amount of pull back from the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five\nWe've seen part of it just struck down by the Supreme Court and after the elections of twenty\nIs what's called in a lot of the decisions that have been handed down in federal courts at least at some levels of the federal courts\nAnd this is what's called an additional burden on a voter you're telling people yeah you can still vote but we're going to put you through some ... we're going to put you through a little bit more of an interrogation when you come in and I think that's something that people can be\nFamiliar with a recognized from our voting past certainly in a number of states where people were required to jump through a lot of extra hoops just to try to register to vote for many years that was outlawed by the voting rights act\nBut we haven't had a certain amount of pull back from the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five\nWe've seen part of it just struck down by the Supreme Court\nAnd after the elections of twenty ten the Tea Party election sometimes called\nWe saw governor such as Scott Walker in Wisconsin really go after this question of voter fraud really strongly believing that there were cases of voter fraud that needed to be rooted out words that there were people out there waiting to vote fraudulent who needed to be prevented and so they passed a lot of these laws voter id\nLaw stricter voter id photo ID\nEgypt which was putting an additional burden on people to exercise what is it constitutional right not a privilege a constitutional right\nYou mentioned Tea Party voting and I think it's important to mention that the redistricting wars uh since uh twenty ten of work to the advantage Republicans are but they are about to take a significant turn these are coming in November elections midterms are have seen efforts to reduce\nPartisan redistricting is likely to make a a a major difference or certainly\nPost twenty twenty especially but let me get some more calls actually before I go to more callers here\nLet me go to more calls this is John John go ahead\n[noise] I don't want to just try it it seems to me that every voter and America\nShould do and track her mind I'm seeing is actually registered they moved across the street like you said or if there's runners depression going on or just some glitch in the computer every single person I think it is who Frank's hair registered\nShould go on I think get a piece of paper\nFrom the voter registration thing I imagine\nIt's not to call her by the name Wanda I didn't mean to call you Jon I saw the are going to different places I'd want to thank you let your comments stand and let me bring another caller bordering is David David joined us\n[noise] yeah oh yeah I notice it there's a real pattern and practice with this uh all the way back in the year two thousand ah the company choice point was hired believe the state of Florida hired them for seven million dollars to remove voters\nAnd they had in Ninety two percent accuracy rate\nAnd uh so the state of Florida by removing all of those voters are then slapped over toward electing Bush is as president\nIn World War for doing that choice point was given a contract for all fifty states plus the U.S military and so by the year two thousand and four\nAre they not only hit removed all sorts of uh people from the fifty states but they were also removing servicemen who were overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq and the phony wars removing their ability to vote because they were out of state\nAnd so this is a ... that they're they continued with in Ninety two percent accuracy rate\nAnd so when you start looking at what's going on in Georgia in Texas in North Dakota\nThis whole concept of of cheating America from their right to vote like these are losing their birthright\nThat's a there's a profit tearing motive that comes with is that those that cheap or get rewarded by homeland security so I Wonder if your guests have got any information on a list to inform America how they're losing their birthright\nLet me go first to Sean Sean this a shot\nI don't know there was an awful lot in in that um comment so I don't know about this choice point a company\nUm I you know I don't know how homeland security is actually involved in the voter registration process most states actually are done and we're in the Republican form of government menial republic each state handles its own voting\nA separately and differently in the state of California counties do differently than than other counties or you've got a federal voting requirement if there is abuse which has happened ah it's generally brought forward by very smart lawyers taken up in the courts so redistricting that you mentioned earlier some of the redistricting plans have been ruled\nTo be too partisan and the un asked to redo it ... in North Carolina that's a legitimate issue should they be allowed to vote based on what the court's orders\nBut you know I I don't know it just sounds like a lot of conspiracy theories stuff here uh you know people do die and people should be taken off the rolls if you're dead if you move out of state I got a daughter and son to go to college out of state they shouldn't be allowed to vote in two states particularly when elections are so close so there's a legitimate need\nFrom secretaries of states around the country and county voting have accurate voter rolls prevent fraud and other issues so the issue is how do you balance that out and make sure it's done fairly an accurate\nLet a male is and what about what the caller raises which is a profit motives how do you see it\nI don't know a lot and not familiar with that particular uh business uh either I Will say though that that is thirty two states with a GOP controlled legislatures have made it difficult to vote and several other states including swing states that are\nNot only set the stage for 'em and are going to determine election results in swing states that we were talking about like Georgia but also in places like Ohio they were critical for the presidential contest\nBut also in places like Ohio they're critical for the presidential contest\nThat you have secretaries of state that Republicans who make a practice and removing people from the voter rolls or requiring like in some states will send in Ohio they'll send a letter um require you to put a stamp and fill out the storm and return it in order to stay on the on the voting world this is ridiculous it's it's a scheme\nIt's not overstating the fact that our birthright as the caller said ah our right to vote or being deeply threatened particularly if\nYou're a person of color or your young um and so the the answer to that are the longer term solutions and you know see the Abrams in her contest expected a Brian Kemp to exercise every voter suppression tactic\nAvailable to him in order to to cheat his way to winning but I think some of the Democrats who are facing very important contests in in congressional and Senate and gubernatorial races may not have that strategy but they may be running\nIn a state where a voter suppression tactics all there is a whole variety of them are are at play and I think that's something that uh people who you know regardless of party it's really they are going to party who are people who want to defend the right to vote\n'em one good way of that people can um exercise their you know volunteer time and focus is to help make sure that people have the information they need in in in a in the states in order to exercise their right to vote shovels you\nWant to add something I just think it's outrageous to claim that thirty two state secretary of state's office or in a massive conspiracy\nTo you know rigged elections I mean you could make that same comment about the state of California with its motor voter\nRight now there are thousands of people who are not legally in this country that word them given uh the capacity to vote I talked to somebody who refuse to be identified who's in the Sixers dates office when do they have they could be well over ten thousand votes so I don't think the state of California using a conspiracy to register undocumented immigrants to vote\nStates do make mistakes states have their own processes and in this case we ought to be looking closer to home about what's going on in California as opposed to some secretary's day trying to get people off the voter rolls well\nLet me go back to you on this Ron Elving especially in light of a question from a listener named Majerle says again is the common practice to recuse yourself when the secretary of state is running for office\nOftentimes they have and other times they see their role as being exactly what they're being called on to do for example you know we have this fellow in Georgia who feels that he is respected by the voters because he has taken a particular a tack\nWith respect to who gets to vote and who doesn't like he was a very much a Trump supported candidate who surprised a lot of people by winning the primary there but he takes a more aggressive standpoint with respect to the changes that are happening in Georgia demographically\nCisco dot com slash go slash choose Web acts\nAnd whether outlook shows a red flag warning in effect until noon today for

delight on Ninety five point seven the game on the good to have you with us welcome good morning America to be back on her good to have you and also go to Jim burn a TV analyst with the Golden State warriors welcome Jim\nThank you Michael and nice to hear your voice bother you as well to be\nWell let's start off with a lot of the U.S repeat for these five all stars are still does seem to be I think\nYeah absolutely and I walked dance to really I think they can agree with this to really enjoy what we're seeing here in the bay area I mean is franchised with the proper for so long you know struggling to get into the playoffs and now they have you know as you mentioned off the top Michael for all stars and they got the markets cousins\nAnd whether it be in the last year in Oakland, California I'm just to go out in an article off with the bank and what we're seeing here today is\nSomething special something that we haven't seen in a long long time you talk about Jordan bulls repeating Kobe and Shaq repeating the Showtime Lakers never repeated bird and the Celtics were repeated wherever\nThe something like that you know for a long time so this team has a chance to win for titles in five years in stead of worried about everything you know off the court and what's gonna happen the off season just enjoy the season because these guys are truly special\nYeah it's funny you mentioned the Celtics Bruce Jenkins you might assume that had a column in the chronicle research this is not necessarily a better team than eighty five eighty six uh Celtics which are many would argue with particularly here in the bay area in\nA gym but many here in the beer and of course are very devoted fans but there are people who loves his team will beyond the bay area because of its spirit and because of his attitude and because it is a great team I'm Wondering are well first of all you're also probably uh at this point prognosticators let's repeat another boom victories season\nWell that's certainly the goal in anything less will be a disappointment no matter how the regular season goes on they got a high standard they set the high standard and they compete yeah within themselves for that kind of thing they've got a lot of private garbage they got a lot of talent\nThat's that is truly special with repeat they could possibly want to repeat which hasn't been done in a long time\nAnd let's hear from you our listeners when we begin with you the morning\nIt's MORNING thank you um you know we have wonderful quality players as people and players but I think we ought to take our hats off to the ownership as well in this day and age where everybody as an owner is trying to get the cities in the states to build their uh facilities for them they put it in their own facility they've taken care of everything\nAnd yes they did move from Oakland but remember that they came to San Francisco in the first place and moved to Oakland but at least this thing in the bay area\nWhen I thank you for that call was the right to another call and if you wanted to innocence each six six seven three three six six Steve from Oakland Steve you're on\nHey up between eighth graders lawyers I I I Know the championship that could have stopped Oregon at this point it's necessary I just I just feel like like they've been here for so long as it's blue collar state that's been built\nAnd when they go to the corporate San Francisco you're gonna get than that probably won't sell to the middle of the second quarter lead to the end of the third maybe pay attention to three minutes it's going to lose its magic and and and you can look at the forty niners moving to leave I look at the giant food candlestick and it's just it's just a whole different sued\nAnd that magic is going to be gone I'm afraid\nYou agree with that ... thing\nI I don't know if I necessarily agree with that and let's look at the forty niners for example they moved forty to fifty miles down south to Silicon Valley to a place\nWhere it's tough to get to Santa Clara by great America there's not much around there so that was kind of expect that what's going on down there Levis and plus the forty niners\nHabit one yet we buy stadium so let's see if when when they have a couple of winning seasons let's see how the environment changes after the giants they need a new stadium I think Eighteen the park has been an absolute home run they were getting ten to Fifteen thousand a night at candlestick\nPark and now you see at AT and T even when they're down there getting thirty thirty five thousand fans and it's a great part by the water you see mission bay rubber mission bay before ATT park there's really nothing down there you drive down Embarcadero it was just water now you see all the bars you\nSee you know you have condos you have everything so I disagree on the part with the giants as well and now the lawyers look let's be honest there will be some blue collar fans get priced out of the chase center I'm it's gonna be tough for a lot of East Bay residents to cross that bridge at that time\nTo get over to the chase in or however I liked the location of the chase and you're right down the street from Eighteen to park\nAgain a lot of things to do around the Trade Center um we'll see and especially if they come in to that building and they open that building was Steph Curry clay Thompson dream on a Kevin Durant fans will still want to come and and so I like the previous caller alluded to um they did start in San Francisco at the cow palace it's the bay area's team I think the way\nYou know that's not rivaled anywhere around the MBA unless you look at Oklahoma City\nA place like that but or color in it has been special to a lot of these guys these guys grow up in that building is definitely going to be tough and I and I know that motivating factor from talking to Steph Curry you know where he goes out there for ... going warm ups and everybody's standard\nAround the court all the kids with their Steph Curry jerseys on taking pictures in the course of Spain tumble shot people working in this that or I'm going to miss that at oracle\nArena it's you know it's where we all grew up here to bay area so I definitely think the warriors will be motivated not to lose too many home games this year and I was one one point Michael\n... last year and you talk about the lackadaisical regular season I have to go to stay where is that they want fifty eight games but they they rushed it a lot of guys at home a lot of their stores or at home I remember one particular home stand where Kevin to rent it and even play so I think we can ... Steve ... arrest us\nPlayers it'll be on the road because he wants to start to play it or in Columbus last in the last year in a building\nCurtis wants to know well he says the rockets could've beat the dogs in the playoffs last year how did the two teams match up this year\n... and still be a tough match up you you have to wonder\nWhat the loss of Lou combine Lew Che interpret reserved for the Houston Rockets they gave him real toughness now you bring a Carmelo Anthony who's on the downside of his career Houston's motivated but I felt like we saw the best of Houston last year and when Chris Paul went down with an injury that definitely changed the series but\nOn the flip side Michael Andrea dollar getting injured and gained over for ... and they're missing them you know the rest of the series basically that really change the serious or to go to State Warriors people forget how important Andrea dollars to the Golden State warriors especially when they're closing a game and he's playing there with Kevin ... the other\nStar so of Houston will be there I said watch for the Lakers with LeBron James he is a difference maker in Oklahoma City with Russell Westbrook apologize I think those three teams will get away with big trouble in the western conference\nWell here's the listener writes the question is not are the warriors good enough to win again they certainly are the question is does anyone else good enough to beat them Houston almost was fully healthy Boston might have been Houston is worse than they were last year at least in terms of what it takes to beat the warriors\nOnly a healthy Celtics roster might compete with the warriors fully healthy with cousins the warriors are unbeatable\nYeah that that listeners on the something here uh the Celtics are primed to look at their team from top to bottom they have a local product in jail and brown who went to Cal Berkeley for season adjacent ... almost a rookie last year he looks like an all star ready and of course Kyrie Irving Gordon Hayward and they have our corporate they are\nDeep uh Brad Stevens to hit close to the Boston Celtics as one of the best coaches in the NBA and they're given the warriors trouble over the last three to four seasons they've won a couple of games that oracle arena it gets Steph\nCurry a clay tops and they'd beat him up pretty good their styles match or last year I Believe the aggregate score was even a if I if I recall it was one Ninety seven Ninety seven if you took both matchups an added up the score so Kyrie Irving we know what he did it totally sixteen\nAgainst everyone he hit that big time three pointer over Steph Curry the Celtics are coming there going to be a problem and if the warriors meet them in the finals\nI'll tell you you may have to pack your terms Michael it'd be a tough series but I think the way you're still have enough to get back to the Celtics but I look at the Celtics as the toughest challenge and unfortunately those two teams are only play twice in the regular season is you\nKnow Mike wants to know directly to the warriors be worried about the Lakers with immigrant\nI don't think so uh I you know LeBron James is a tough player they have a lot of young talent Brennan Ingram Alonzo ball towel coups or their deep I still think they're a year away\nUm but ... the Lakers would be there I I personally I have the Lakers go into the western conference finals um I don't ... especially if they end up on the opposite side of the bracket\nAs they go to state wars because were brawn James is that good he's that much of a difference to make er he's again typically there's no doubt about it but I Believe the Lakers are still about a year away from catching the Golden State warriors\nWho got on the hill in us see again as co host of the top of that thing in the light it's a Ninety five points in the game and he's a sportswriter for the San Francisco to examine her can you give us a preview of Tuesday's game\nYes Oklahoma City uh I Believe Russell Westbrook fortunately unfortunately will not\nPlaying this game he at Arthur Scott the surgery a little less than a month ago a I don't even believe he's going to travel with the Oklahoma City thunder warriors if for all your gambling experts out there to favor by twelve it is wearing night the lawyers have lost her last season opener as I got blown out two years ago by the San Antonio spurs and Kevin Iran's first game with the state warriors\nAnd then last season it gets used in where they lost that game a dream on green got hurt and third quarter they blow double digit lead I think this time around\nThe last season opener at oracle arena I Believe the warriors were role and be want to know to start the season\nAnd here's Danny who says the warriors head performance earth and she'll see land left to run the Atlanta Hawks sending now how is the team handling the loss and how would they keep curry healthy\nYeah see that's a funny what Chelsea laying went to Atlanta a lot of people have made a big deal the feds loved Chelsea later the players left Chelsea laid\nA I the name of slipping me I who who the new head of performance

here\nI Want to get back to the question of excuse me if you're on many your constituents about having sanctuary cities are making the state of sanctuary state or for that matter abolishing I Stacey [noise]\nNot necessarily in and these are not necessarily people who are unsympathetic to immigrants coming here and feel that in many cases a very strong affinity for immigrants that are afraid of

in danger of being deported that ice was coming\nWell let me say Michael that we have the right to protect our own sovereignty and no one's saying abolishing the border patrol\nIn fact I've been on

lost your opportunity to become an American in the contribute to our society\nSo that's very dramatically different because no one's talking about abolishing the border patrol every nation in the

objectives\nMess out of the president is saying build a wall keep the rape is out and all of those kinds of things which are contributes probably to the fear that I'm Talking about\nWell great so that
