that I'm a you know President Trump says that it's about him but um I think you can pretty much assume that if it goes south or he's already been saying privately but it's not about him so he's only going to take credit for it or if it's successful uh he's done that in the past and he's a centrally\nYou know blamed people who lost either on on the way they manage their campaign a war or the fact that they didn't uh Hugh closely enough to his policies and programs and so forth so [noise] you know I I don't know about that I think the platform\nUh I I think the ... the issue is not going to resonate with people in the so called fly over states you know between the the the west coast on the east coast\nUnfortunately a where the much bigger issue um I mean the additional issue of of what the Saudis are doing in Yemen and how much um you know a bit how many billions of dollars on weapons were sending them\nBut I Do think the caravan issue is going to be a part of a you know an important a scene here which is you know the the sort of post truth\nUh campaigning style Trump in which they're appealing to people's emotions instead of facts I mean what he said today in a tweet about how there's criminals and unknown middle Easterners or in the caravan\nUh again it's just ludicrous at least two people that you know follow these issues I mean they don't know the names of these people or or even general details about them so I I don't know how they would know that they're\nUm unknown middle Easterners or I don't know how they would know that they have criminal records um ah so but I think people will tend to believe that because it's kind of scaring up ah this this uh atmosphere a climate of fear among his base that has worked in the past so I think we do in\nMali hold on a second because we do have Myer uh ever back now and she's a freelance reporter writing for the New York times and joined us from ... Mexico by over back welcome to the program good to have more here [noise]\nBut\nUh I Hope your home your phone holds out well because I Want to hear what you're seeing and what you were serving on the ground there can you give us a quiz lobsters\nAnd oh it did in near the border and share of it where China yesterday\nAnd then here overnight and get in get out of it and it never really\nLiked it yeah gotta\nGet get attention and all that going and so for and right now\nOkay and I very much richer your being with us don't have to let you go though 'cause the connection is not as good as I'd like to be but let me go back to you Molly ball you were going to make a comment before please proceed\n[noise] oh I just wanted to say I think Josh is certainly right that foreign policy is not usually a big voting issue and that it's probably not going to change a lot of\nPeople's minds out there in the in the heartland that this has occurred but I Do think it ... it it plays into ah one of the things that you do hear about from voters which is concerned about Trump's temperament you do hear from voters even Republican voters and a lot of independent voters\nOr that they worry about the president's not just the tweeting and the ... the you know outburst ah but the fact that his governing style is fundamentally improvisational a and that you never know what to expect for him from him in the end and his diplomacy is sort of a blunt force instrument\nOr that that lacks a lot of the sun\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks than any firm Comcast extending the Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nIs at an episode reminds people of that concern about Trump I think that could play a role\nOne day he's doing consistently though and this is obviously a lead into the midterms is he's blaming the Democrats are almost do we not as much as he says no collusion or the Democrats are to blame and uh they didn't let us let me put up a wall and they voted against it and so forth or is this resonating on the heartland do you think\nWell it's interesting that he simultaneously blames the Democrats for not letting him do that while I'm also claiming that the wall is actually being built which isn't really true there since fencing that's being reinforced\nI so I you know I think people know that the Republicans own what is happening people know that the Republicans have the house and Senate and so whether it's you know uh if conservatives who are\nAnnoyed that Obamacare wasn't repealed or\nIndependents who look and see for the most part more gridlock\nNot to mention the Democrats who are really ... I incredibly energized this year I ... I think it is hard to avoid the what the president himself said that this election is mainly a referendum on Trump and the Republican Party I you do have Democrats straining very hard to\nI Try to come up with a positive message try to talk about the things that they would actually do if they were in charge at but the reason I think that gets sort of a lost in the clamor is that people are seeing is mainly as an election about Trump and the Republicans\nThere's also talk coming from my phone pale and let me go to you and there's just more about uh the violence of the border and children being used as shields and so forth and that doesn't ... you know are we didn't have a great connection but from what I'm hearing those who are\nUh at the scene there's very little of that I mean there was some violence or initially a that was reported but what do we know at this point\nYeah I I don't buy that at all I mean I've been to the border not recently but I've I've been I've done right along with border patrol there and I'm not you know and gun basically to the front line even into Mexico in in a auto I'm Indian tribal territory which has straddles both countries\nAnd that's just it's just another cannot read I don't think that that's the case at all first of all terrorists are people that are trying to sneak into the country for nefarious reasons\nFor the last thing they are going to do is is a cloak themself in some big unruly group of um you know a refugees are other people from Central America that are trying to sneak into the country [noise]\nUh they're certainly not going to get in the middle of a caravan that has a lot of publicity around it and and reporters following it\nUm in terms of the people that are just trying to get into the country are you know the just the sort of general people uh I don't think that there are by nature of violent group of people I think that they are legitimately people that are desperate to get out of\nWhatever situation there in in in in El Salvador and in other ... Honduras countries like that and um you know that they're they're basically in survival mode and that that's basically you know the extent of their problems\nOf the bigger issue is whether or not the U.S government can reach into those countries and and try to eliminate the problem is that the source including em is Thirteen\nBut there doesn't seem to be any appetite for that right now it seems like people are are not really interested in solving the problem they're just interested or at least with regard to the Trump Administration of using it as an election uh issue\nWhat we're talking about the migration we're also of course talking about the ongoing concern about the deaths than it is now a murder or from everybody standpoint of democracy ... but we'd like to hear from you would like to hear your thoughts\nOn this in any question or comment you might have we're talking with Molly ball of time and CNN and judge Myra political and you if you would care to join us now\nYou can

the care of it is a complicated process or requires a lot of resources who organized it could just be another Russian effort to influence us elections in Trump's favor\nI have not seen any evidence to that effect and that seems like a rather elaborate not the style of the types of fresh and campaigns that we've seen which has focused more on cyber warfare and an Internet based\nStuff I I mean it it it it strikes me is extremely unlikely this is not the first one of these efforts daddy's these migrant caravans\nHad occurred for years and years and they are in part\nOrganized by advocacy groups although they do also rely on donations from people along the way who helped the migrants as they made their way north I so it seems much more like a typical effort like that only larger\nThan other quick question to you Josh Meyer about a ... show the saga bill writes in twenty sixteen he'll report the trouble applied for a business licenses in Saudi Arabia during the campaign something smells other than the Saudi take on this quick response from are we talking ... here\nMaybe the saying well yeah I mean I think that you know uh the Trump\nFamily and President Trump himself and the administration a writ large or\nEspecially transactional in nature when it comes to the sort of thing so as we saw with China and avant goes licenses and\nAh and copyrights or you know that it does it is a factor even though it shouldn't be uh so we have to be very careful of that one thing that I what I Would want to mention is also that the Iran a part of this is a big wildcard if Iran to hold that thought I'm Sorry we couldn't\nGuide visit ... dot org slash elections and see the latest updates on our programs and guess find us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter We're at ... for them [noise]\nIt being you know what is the history in terms of journalists whether American\nPresident that tried Barrett can\nBeing killed or either ... or by the U.S in the world is really a one off at Stanford and changed if we're moving forward trying to say that like more of the\nAmerican and letting them is why I don't know it will go can't answer\nWell there's a lot of questions embedded in your question and uh let me go back to Mali ball here comes to my mind immediately is Danny Pearl of course I mean we've had our own problems with our journalists being under assault and other countries\nThat trade in most polls are American journalists have been murdered\nBy ISIS and I in in every instance they seemed to know what they were doing which was to in ... the United states as deeply as possible and cell and the United states has always responded in that scene so it would not be if it it it it it's just a unique situation on\nMultiple levels because those were not internal dissidents criticizing their home countries criticizing their own regime they were reporters for American news organizations ah\nBut it certainly is the case that that the United states has seen fit to respond forcefully in those situations I answer the question remains what level of response will this cat and and and will the administration as Josh was saying use the fact that this was not a typical\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks than any firm Comcast extending the Internet delivers in home life by for all devices and the home some kind of excuse for not responding as forcefully\nReading a comment from a listener named Ron ... says everyone should now finally removed avail covering the brutality of Saudi Arabia and their ... and with the global establishment of the addresses in the Nineteen eighties and Maureen does article which I mentioned Ron says should give a good summary does give a good summary of their terrible history\nNathan asks you stated that Yemen is being attacked with Saudi missiles to us as much salt through Yemen as the Saudis are foreign policies who created the humanitarian crisis in Yemen when will peace be a priority for the U.S government maybe when it becomes profitable such Josh\nWell I'm Glad that he raised that issue because I think that that's something that's been um I mean journalists have been covering this but it hasn't been getting a lot of attention to what the Saudis are doing in Yemen a is a humanitarian crisis in a catastrophe in the United states is is essentially facilitating that by continuing to provide the Saudis with [noise]\nYou know billions of dollars worth of weapons and advice or I Believe some training and um you know I was at a conference last year for Arab journalists and Jordan\nAnd that there were several dozen a journalist from Yemen there and we had several very long conversations and and what they're saying is that people are literally dropping dead dying or the children are are ... you know nourished and stunted and so forth and and the the the extent of the catastrophe there\nUm is something that is almost unprecedented in in our Titus\nPresently the worst humanitarian crisis in the world\nIs right right yes I mean we're talking billions of people and so the outcry um ... you know is it has been muted at best I think in that you know that's something that the U.S Congress needs to uh accept some responsibility for too\nBut you know the Trump Administration has been very ah again transactional when it comes to dealing with these issues I mean Trump has literally or at least he's honest about if he has said very publicly that he doesn't want to up and the relationship with the Saudis because they're giving us so much business in terms of buying our weapons so the question is\nYou know is that by adding jobs to your right\nRight so you know go ahead please no no so I mean I I think that you know the American public um I Hope it continues to be informed by good reporting on this because it is a ... as as tragic as ... as a you know this is this is something on a much broader scale what's happening in Yemen and it's happening in other countries\nAre too in terms of what the Saudis are doing and projecting power\nUm if I can just I Would want to address the earlier question about journalists being killed I mean more journalists are killed every year than before and I think that you have to separate\nWho's being killed or you know the American journalist that have been killed by ISIS and other terrorist groups are from ... from state sponsored terrorists or excuse me state sponsored killing of journalists um I mean I was in Pakistan\nWriting about the same people as Daniel Pearl when he was kidnapped and be headed a but that was a terrorist organization or the Saudis and the Pakistanis and other countries like that are killing literally hundreds of their own journalists and getting away with it um partially because they're not American journalist or British journalists and I think that that's a huge problem that needs to be\nThey're much more a much more thoroughly\nAnd Molly ball of the Washington Post reported that there's going to be an investigation by the United nations that there's going to be an international meeting on this uh can you update us on that\nI that's all the information that I had at this point and I think as Josh was saying earlier we'll see what comes out of the evidence that the\nTurks had said that they haven't and ... American intelligence has said that they have and then I think that the question from there will be watching the international community plan to you that I didn't like it the man station plan to do about it if it if they see is what we think it is and there's not much reason to suspect that it isn't\nI they they are going to be forced to decide whether to hold accountable in any my\nQuick question if you ... you know there's been complaints by people like Senator Corker that American intelligence has not been forthcoming there are other complaints coming about a turkey who is supposedly our ally in NATO not being forthcoming what do you make of the\nWell we'll see I mean this is an investigation underway there are going to see if they are\nA cooperative I mean that the Turks have an axe to grind here as well against the Saudis there obviously that if he had an interest in a way that they cast this and the way that they make this law so it is going to be whether it's the international investigation the American investigation\nIs dependent investigation that the Saudis are doing more information about this is inevitable decline to come out and we are going to have a clearer picture at two in front of\nMe ... been talking with Molly ball national political correspondent for time and CNN political analyst and by the way I Would recommend that people\nWho have been under the impression is I've been that fifty two percent of white American women voted for Donald Trump read your new article in time magazine Molly because you set the record straight it's not a majority it's actually a plurality of forty seven percent important article and I congratulate you for that and thank you for joining us this morning\nThank you very much and thank you Josh Meyer senior investigative reporter with political and justice has been covering this for quite a while now and a\nHigh marks Josh thanks for joining us this morning but to have you my pleasure Thanks Michael we are are going to shift gears now because we're going to turn to another topic in the news over the weekend the New York times reported on a memo obtain that shows\nThat the department of health and Human Services is attempting to establish a legal definition definition of gender\nThat narrowly defined as biological and an changeable determined by genitalia at birth New York times says this is quote the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWhat questions do you have you can join the conversation now by calling toll free eight six six seven three three six seven eight six or emailing\nSo free eight six six seven three three six seven eight six or emailing us for ... Oregon joining us to discuss this has done in the cold and political reporter for most feed you fellows oh gee BTU Susan welcome to the show and\nThank you so much for having me will the implications of this ah I think it would people immediately want to know how do you see them\nWell I mean the fits in line with what the Trump Administration has done essentially from the first month and office which is to roll back protections for transgender people\nUm they have both change their interpretations of titles set an under federal employment law and roll back their interpretation of title nine in education\nIt's important to recognize that this is a memo from last spring according to the New York times they would weigh in on title nine that education law and the health\nDivision is not the primary agency that enforces this and would promulgate or regulation so right now we have a question about this memo is this essentially Roger several Reno from age eight justices civil rights office who came from the Heritage Foundation\nExploring options of what he would like to see done with his political agenda or is there something more recent that represents a decision or some sort of action from the Trump Administration at this point based on the times reporting we don't have that we essentially just have a representation of an agenda from the evangelical right\nBut the transgender people who are excluded from being in the military would ... I think suspect that this would be definitely coming from the Trump Administration is in a pattern of a ... that is for lack of a better word pacify ... they're concerned about gender bathrooms and all the rest of the\n[noise] right and that really gets to another key point which is that although the Trump Administration has attempted to roll back the rights of transgender Americans to serve in the military they have so far failed to do so\nIn fact the Pentagon currently by policy allows transgender people to serve meanwhile the Labor Department and forces and executive order from President Obama in twenty fourteen protecting the rights of transgender federal workers and contractors and the EEOC\nActively fights for the rights of transgender Americans who are employed in the private sector so we have a number of federal policies that do protect transgender people currently\nCake you read the of San Francisco cake you we are in Northern Ireland Sacramento [noise]\nFrom the public radio in San Francisco Michael Krasny Californians have been changing their clocks twice a year for nearly seven decades after voters approved the state acts\nThe stumbling daylight saving time but proposition seven which appears on this November's valley could end the practice by authorizing the state legislature to make daylight savings time permanent those who favor say your own daylight saving time with a limited sleep disruption lower health risks like\nHeart attacks and strokes but skeptics say darker winter mornings could lead to more traffic accidents and put California out of sync with other states\nWill discuss the pros and cons and the history of daylight saving time that's next after this [noise]\n\nLife from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi saying the Trump Administration is preparing to end assistance to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador countries from which thousands of people have fled in search of greater safety and paying work\nTrump says he's determined to block a migrant caravan from crossing into the U.S illegally\nThe president has repeatedly warned of unauthorized immigrants who resort to gang and other violence in the United states\nThose making the track north include young and old families and individuals able bodied and wheelchair bound Mexico's president elect suggested yesterday that his country the U.S and Canada work together to fund development in poor areas of southern Mexico and Central America\nWhere caravans are forming NPR's Mara Liasson reports on the political implications of the caravan is President Trump stumps in Texas today for incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz\nThis is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the mid term he's not only said without evidence that they are criminals he's even said that there are terrorists\nThat's NPR's Mara Liasson Ashley Lopez of member station K.

Twitter handle is that take you to form I Know there are a lot of personal reactions to uh going full time to daylight savings time in terms of your own inner clocks biologically or otherwise when so we'd like to hear what you have to say you Daniel vent and with us reporter and editor for science and\nDr David ... author of sees the daylight that curiously contentious story of daylight savings time and Michael Downey who's a creative writing professor at Towson wrote a book called spring forward the annual madness of daylight saving time in\n... let me go right to the historical question here with you Michael since you take it up in your book are you talking about at the real big reason to move this forward to lose the United states was commerce\nYeah that's right the first and most important lobby for daylight saving in the United states was the chamber of commerce but they realize as early as Nineteen sixteen is that if you gave Americans an extra hour of daylight at the end of the day\nThey would stop and shop on their way home and big city retailers particularly the big department stores were so powerful early in the century solve the possible benefits of this and as soon as we had our first experiments with it they saw a tremendous uptick in sales\nThat has never gone away as a lobby the chamber of commerce on behalf of retailers has been the principal\nLobby behind every extension of daylight saving the David pro was talking about earlier from six months in Nineteen sixty six to eight months today and the numbers\nAre not small let's just take a simple industry you know um sports have always profited by daylight saving because people have more light at the end of the day we leave our houses we go out and play sports the golf industry has us than in past the border of daylight savings because of course you can't eliminate\nGolf courses they're too big and so\nLike Nineteen eighty six Gulf industry said one extra hour of daylight an extra months of it was worth four hundred and fifty million in additional greens fees and equipment sales the same goes for the barbecue industry the gardening industry in the home repair industry\nYou give Americans more light at the end of the day we really do leave our house\nBut if we want to go back a historical origins we go to Ben Franklin who of course was in France in Paris or as an investor in the United states and know realize when it got up in the morning that it made a lot of sense in terms of saving a candle talent for a cause and all the rest of that\nBut I tried to fencing on almost invented daylight saving like you almost have ventured whitening apparently um he was he noticed as you ... you know remarked on this waste of what he thought was a natural resource early in the morning because of the world was not yet on the clock signed largely\nEquipment than daylight saving ... when William lowered a British architect noticed the same thing or early in the twentieth century the world was on ...\nJust a really engage and compelling interest but let me go back to talk to David prayer on this history I mean we we saw a ... for the first time extended a Steelers anytime during the Roosevelt administration and it really was largely will to save energy during wartime yeah\nFor it which part first we put it in World War one as every country on both sides of the war it did\nAnd it started out that even though it will it had the idea is Michael mentioned it was Germany you put it daylight savings time in the first to save energy for the war and as as soon as\nAh the British heard that the Germans that died in a month later they put it in as well and then every country on both sides of the war dead and then the same thing happened in World War two so way less than two months after Pearl Harbor we put in daylight savings time or\nTo save energy for the for the for the war\nAnd again as I lose this will be four in the Nixon administration\nYes that was actually a very hurting hurting the situation for the current crop seven ... seven because that was a peace time they've only peace time use of year round daylight savings time nationally and that was in Nineteen Seventy three editor energy crisis\nAnd the Congress and the president will look for ways to save energy and what was the extended daylight saving time so they extended it for a two year period or what happened was\nThe winter I'm Nineteen Seventy four when it was first put in it became so popular because people didn't like getting up in the dark going to work in the dark and particularly like sending their kids to school and art\nAnd so it was so packed with it even though it was only put in for a two year trial period\nCongress cancel the second year\nOf winter daylight savings time\nAnd they still had extended daylight saving time but I just had extended from six to eight months not for the full year as it was intended so so the only time that we really try Iran daylight saving time\nIt was very unpopular and was immediately taken out and that might have some partners to the current a proposal\nWell I Want to get back to the proposal even though I Love some of these stories with daily swimming assuming they're fascinating there was actually case here in California back in Nineteen Ninety seven or manslaughter case was decided because of daylight savings time\nAnd one can go through the list of these things when I Know we're really going to focus on ... and let's do that and we'll find out what your listeners have to say some of the\nLegislators in the state of said things are on the Republican side he broke don't fix it costs too much confusion or we've heard from a another state senators and it's maybe the better more on the Democratic side bitter more important things to focus on and be more concerned about but there seems to be\nCertainly a strong consensus of people who feel that this is the way that we should go so let's go to our callers let's begin with you Joseph you're on MORNING\nOr good ... good morning Michael thank you for taking my call\n... I'm a I'm an opponent to seven I'm old enough to have lived through those uh uh early school mornings in the seventies when I had to walk to school and that was like pitch black out trying to get out of bed in the morning that was kind of horrible and it seems to me\nThat the authors of propped up and got it backwards in other words it seems that most people who have kids complain about the idea that they have to get their kids up an hour earlier in the spring and would have preferred\nThat the time not change and we don't go to daylight said in the next to\nThis thing about that but kind of an artist you know it's going to be better is that you know in Nineteen Fifteen ... that we didn't have a twenty four seven economy but we do now\nSeems like more people are out ... at all hours of the day and night and it doesn't really make that much of a difference to me at least so that's that's kinda my comment and I'll take the response out\nThere and I think you've come and just let me go back to her as he can be science reporter Daniel vent and what about using such would maybe we've got it backwards you\n[laughter] [noise] well there are some groups who would like to see on year round standard time the problem is that would mean the we wouldn't be making as much use of the day like in the summer on and the evenings would would get darker theater\nI mean parents are kind of all over the map in how they feel about ah daylight saving time in a way I mean there that they enjoy having a light in the evening maybe if their kids are sports\nOn at the same time they don't like the idea of you know and understand it either very unpopular for kids to go to school in the dark\nI mean something that I think should be part of this conversation is the idea that schools should start at a later time on you know seven thirty start times eight and start times\nI'm looking at things from listeners who essentially support that idea and said that's what we should be looking at here as well\nYeah yeah and and and researchers agree that that would be better for developing teenage brains and let kids sleep in a little bit longer\nWe're coming up on the brink Danielle good can you say anything about jetlag daylight saving time\nWhile way we bring forward in a in March and we are all jet lagged about an hour and not and so if if your co workers or your family is a little bit shorter [noise] a little bit groggy that because we as a society are all collectively jet lagged\nAnd then we're going to continue this discussion and again we do want to hear from you and you can join this toll free at eight six six seven three three six Seventy six or tweet us our Twitter handle is happy too easy for them or go to our website ... dot org slash forum this is for among tiki B.D public radio on Michael crafts\nAnd let's get sleep and a little bit longer\nWe're coming up on her break Danielle but can you say anything about jetlag and daylight saving time\n[noise] while the way we bring forward in a in March we are all jet lagged about an hour and that and so if if your co workers or your family it's a little bit shorter a little bit craggy because we either as a society are all collectively jet lagged\nAnd we're going to continue this discussion and again we do want to hear from you and you can join us toll free at eight six six seven three three six seven eight six or tweet us our Twitter handle is actually ... D for 'em or go to our website ... dot org slash forum this is for ... public radio on Michael Krasny [noise]\n[noise]\nMichael Downey want to come in and there's\nNo I think David got it exactly right and of course are playing it you know isn't a perfect Orban or its electrical path around the sun makes it hard to get these measurements to be exact according to any single measure so I I think they would go to the exact we write on how we first got to this idea of what are we trying to accomplish with Michael\n... book again to spring for the annual madness of daylight savings time in a David ... book is she's the daylight that curious and contentious story of daylight saving time we'll get more of your calls on and if you'd like to join the conversation or get your own thoughts in here it's eight six six seven three three six seven eight six\nWe go next Patricia good morning\nOr good morning thank you for taking my call I Am going to actually say that Leslie ... she said all that I wanted to say I'm actually certainly I agree with her that it's so much better I think for all of us to have that an extra ten my at the end of the day and I remember a\nBetty and I'm going to be really foggy on that's I think it without a Finland where they were trying\nBetty and I'm going to be really foggy on that's I think it without a Finland where they were trying to study the level of depression and keep up went into a rate of ... depression when in fact there um when it was darker earlier in the days I'm\nOut just close with it I Do I Do think it's a great idea to have one time all year round because um it makes no sense for us to do this twice a year but um\nI I uh would like to also say that I think it's one of the fun things to do at this time of year if you ask people why we change our clocks twice a year I just put that out there 'cause I think that come up with her and the funniest thing\nBut they always talk about the farmers so I don't know if your guest comment on that because I don't understand why the farmer took part of this any way out L and with that\nI Want to get to the farmers but first let me go to Daniel ... maybe you can send some light on the dark here in depression or then this study Daniel\n[noise] um I'm not familiar with that with a ... study but you know seasonal seasonal affective disorder is a very common condition when the uh when you know more dark less daylight um affects affects many of us\nAnd researcher at that I spoke to suggest getting out in the sunlight by half an hour a day if that is something that affects you now some people enjoy the lighter morning because they they exercise in the morning many people enjoy the lighter evenings it's\nYou know as we've said there's just there's no way to have\nBoth there's only there's only so much daylight on one idea could be if I if all of our schedule could be a little bit more flexible and then we could you know just use use the daylight\nOn at the time that works best for us that could almost be a simpler solution then worrying about clocks changing twice a year\nWill be going to you Michael dining if I may on this whole question of the farmers they were kind of up in pitchforks during the Nixon administration\n[laughter] I've been up in Pittsburgh since the beginning of the twentieth century when this was first proposed\nMost Americans grow up with them is that we do it for the farmers\nIn like everything else would they like to I think it's entirely inverted the farmers from the beginning hated daylight saving farmers actually use morning sunlight so when they had let's say a sunrise it's six o'clock in the morning and they had to get their crops harvest it into markets at nine o'clock and three hours\nWhen the clocks went forward by an hour they have to do the same amount of work into ours farmers hated daylight savings in fact they were the principal reason we never had a national peace time daylight saving well\nUntil Nineteen sixty six and that's because the farm lobby is no longer as powerful as it once was in fact a very moving statistic and this is simple goes like this year two thousand more Americans living on the Gulf Coast and then they were Americans moving on from one of the farmers lost\nAgribusiness thinking is so [noise] that's right\nI'm looking at a comment from a listener who says are leaving the standard time but have business in school just operating hours\nAnd another coming from a listener named Richard is is the arguments that we must keep daylight savings time so the children don't go to school in the dark as absurd Arizona does not have daylight savings time European Union is getting rid of it this year in children in northern Alaska and all the Scandinavian countries go to school in the dark all winter and always have\nAll that was sending to the doctor Perot remember reading about the only time during the Nixon administration in addition to\nA concern about children getting up and desserts were actually some deaths in Florida that were attributed to them with their\nParents right there was a [noise] several incidents of children being killed in a way to school in the dark and go\nAh they call it a national a debate or national interests because\nOf the fact that was the day I Wish we had to round daylight saving time\nAt a lot of people thought that if we did they say retiring in the winter [noise] those children would have been a would it be safe so they became very a very a major issues at the time every time there was an accident involving trade you're going to school in the morning\nAnd let me bring more callers aboard here we go next to in Oklahoma Jim you're on the good morning\nThe morning a my come does mostly about the fact that time zones are kind of give this idea that this is the standard time and daylight saving time as a modification of our standard time when if you were actually to use the sun dial a daylight savings time here on the west coast uh Oakland especially\nWould actually lined up better with our local Meridian\nYeah we're getting a lot of questions about uh and comments about the changing time zones Daniel my hope is on\nThe on the could you summarize the question again\nHe just wanted to know about the problem with time zones that that that really creates a problem with the challenge if you're going to go over to do and savings time comes\nYou know I mean we would be out of sync with some of the what the other state on and their time zones and that could create confusion for scheduling meetings for airline flights\nOn by other states such as Arizona don't switch their clocks and and are we likely would be able to adjust\nYeah come in from ... who says I support the daylight saving time like Arizona but not changing times zones if I wanted to live in a state in the mountain time zone or move to\nColorado let's move to another caller and we'll get Mitchell on next mission you're mckell I'm Sorry go ahead and the gal\nThat are there I was just going to point out that um the company I work with food we deal with software and also the the product itself has to log the time and ...\nWe deal with software and also the the product itself has to log the time and are\nYou guys were just talking about Arizona and it it's a it's kind of a hassle for the developers to have to deal with certain states\nAnd they switch and other states right next to them do not like right now we're actually on the same time zone as Arizona but you know mind but it won't be um and they have to factor that in state by state so it's actually it costs the software industry time and money\nI think you've heard that call mckell and I should say here's what we're talking about Arizona broadly we should uh at least have important footnote here or there is so true in Arizona but not in the ... the whole nation which was not recognize daylight savings time\nJust a mounted a point that out because they are in Arizona Michelle citizen soon as bringing forward or falling back one hour twice a year when a permanently split the difference my half an hour and call it a day [laughter]\nAnd here's Brian who says a wedge just read Brian's before I let me go to some more of our callers and let's go uh\nWell actually let me go next to you or Michael Downey because when we look back at the whole history and that's an filled with daylight savings time there is a as a David pro points out in his subtitled a great deal of contentiousness contentiousness is still very much with us\nWell you know part of the contention is comes from the whole ... very name of daylight saving in precisely what we're saying and I do think this is relevant particularly the California\nThere has always been a debate about whether any real energy was ever saved and the amount as David pointed that tend to be marginalized best many new researchers would say we've never say than the energy but there's an important point in California but the rest of the country then found out\nIn Nineteen thirty California had the first referendum on daylight saving and the principal supporter of that referendum who pay for it was the most expensive referendum in history to that point was the petroleum industry\nBecause early on the petroleum industry realized if you give American more daylight we will go out to the ballpark in the mall but we don't walk we draw lines daylight saving rate increases gasoline consumption\nAnd it's a really important factor it's not mine or the new most important lobby for daylight savings single one is the national association of convenience stores\nThat's not because people talking about and we're Hershey bars it's because Americans by Seventy five to eighty percent of their gasoline that those convenience stores and every year on Capitol Hill the national association of convenience stores gives the daylight saving party to St Congress for daylight saving\n... well let me go back to you David Perot or and follow up on something from Michael ... recent cause the common he just made and that is ... it's it's a true and at this point actually managed to a new energy and all these promises energy savings have actually never really materialized", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22"}
