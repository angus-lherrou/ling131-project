mayor of San Antonio Texas in two thousand Ninety burst onto the national scene with a speech about the American dream in his keynote address at the twenty twelve Democratic National convention\nCapital later served as President Obama's secretary of housing and urban development and he was on the shortlist for potential running mates with Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen before she settled on Virginia Senator Tim Kaine\nHe has a new memoir is titled an unlikely journey Castro shares his experiences growing up in San Antonio with his twin brother Joaquin who is now a member

Scott\nBefore we talk about your book and your career I Want to ask you about the use of mail bombs that were sent there isn't harassed now a were or the FBI has reported a fifty six I Believe you're old man ... in South Florida [noise]\nYou know as someone who is the brother of an elected official someone who has been an elected official describe but these last few days have been like\nI think for everybody um [noise] uh this is something that didn't steal instilled a lot of a concern\nAnd for folks that may be directly impacted by that one I think he sent out twelve\nUm packages a including two are elected officials in Washington of course it's a major source of concern and I would say for those staffs even fear\nSo everybody's happy that they've apprehended a suspect uh my hope is that this quick apprehension will deter others coming you know you always see these copycats in these kinds of things [noise]\nUm some months ago we had a ... a similar situation it wasn't as politically motivated by in Austin, Texas and I was proud of the work of law enforcement there to apprehend that suspect\nSo you know my hope is that um\n[noise] that this is going to be ... be the end of that um but my larger concern is about the ability\nOf uh our president to um\nCombination and to encourage unity instead of division we cannot hold Donald Trump directly responsible for the actions of this man you know those are his actions\nBut leaders do have a role to play in setting a tone and you know when he starts calling\nThe\nPress the enemy of the people and hearts on that over and over and over and uses some of the rhetoric I'm fed hinted violence\nWell strikingly many of the people if not all who received these packages that have been people he has targeted either directly or indirectly\nYeah and you know you would hope that you have a leader in that position that can um that can bring people together and uh and encourage\nCalled instead of this division but he seems so intent to hunt fanning the flames of that he's gone back to the rhetoric accusing the media of being the problem and I just wish he would take some responsibility and and most importantly changed his tone\nAnd I wanted to do what I could to ensure that\nMore people where I came from could have some kind of opportunity I did by going back and improving the education levels and improving the income levels and making it more ready for the twenty first century and what inspired me was the difference that I saw here in the bay area\nYou wrote in the book and I'm looking for the exact quote but it was something like that you were angry at when you realized the difference and opportunity between what you and your brother had versus a lot of the kids white kids wealthier families who were at Stanford ... talk about that little bit\nWhen I saw and what I write about in the book was um\nYou could really tell the people had come from\nA high school backgrounds where there were different levels of opportunity and specifically talking about the number of AP classes\nThat I think at my high school there were two or three and that you could even take and I remember people being at Stanford with twelve different AP classes and the credits for it and so you know\nThe good thing the nice thing about being at Stanford was that\nPeople respected each other and folks Saul you there as as being smart and kind of on everybody on the same level at the same time there were these differences going in there um and you could tell that for all of the people who didn't make it there or to one of the schools [noise]\nYou know you could tell part of the reason why you still have a tremendous amount of inequality out there in the in the school system\nDid change the way you thought about or maybe you hadn't even thought about affirmative action\nI'm Out you know I I've uh\nSupported the use of affirmative action because I Do think that there is a value in diversity\nUm you know I Know that that also is a complicated issue obviously it's been litigated with respect to Harvard right now I think it makes sense for these admissions officers to be able to consider the whole person and that they're different ways that people can overcome um you know obstacles but\nThere is no question in my mind that to walk around the streets of San Francisco today or of Oakland as a young black man a he is different\nFrom the experience of of some other folks and that we need to be mindful still as we build out these um university classes of peoples different experience and what that can add to the learning environment you\nWere in the bay area that are really interesting time two things I mean one of the dot com boom hadn't quite happened but companies like Netflix a Netscape Google was started right around that time how where were you of\nThis sort of technological explosion happening right on campus literally\nMean I was aware of it because um we're reading about some of it at the time but it was also nascent in the sense that you you had Netscape a ... huh\nAnd said you you had Netscape a last year when he was proud router yeah you\nKnow you didn't have the proliferation of social media and even search engines I think all of this uh and and maybe Google was started\nAs a navy around and yeah but\nYeah um Yahoo but it wasn't wasn't nearly to the same extent that you have now I remember that the each of the the uh computer dorm rooms had these old Macintoshes and also they had each of them had one next\nComputer you remember those ... computers were bombing or whatever you want to use violent I think there was like one person and the whole dorm that knew how to operate that thing yeah\n[laughter] well you're also if you're a when prop one eighty seven was on the ballot in Nineteen Ninety four and again you're immersed in your school work probably but for many Latinos in California now and the legislature and elsewhere that's how they got involved in politics was through\nProp one eighty seven which was anti immigrant measure that was on the ballot or at that time how where were you of that and was there organizing a and political activity at that time on the campus\nOh of course there was and there was a lot of activity in that year of Nineteen Ninety four ah [noise]\nI Do remember that in fact I remember sitting in front of um the TV and the the common room the dorm room lounge the dorm lounge and are those commercials coming on the had the grainy footage from a legal swirling ... coming and yelling embarrassed really embarrassed\nWell I mean it felt like an indictment done the tone of the whole campaign felt like an indictment of law at the community and I'm sure that if you asked Pete Wilson back then are you as folks who supported they would say well you know they were just talking about undocumented immigrants and this is what Trump says now\nBut um but the tone of it really had the Xena phobic edge to it [noise] and um\nAnd I felt embarrassed about that [noise] we're in a in this time of course where immigration has become such a flash points uh and it's interesting because after the twenty twelve election that Republicans did this famous sort of\nAutopsy of what happened with Mitt Romney and they decided the party had to become more diverse and reach out to more Latino and Asian Americans and people who were not white upper middle class or older\nVoters and in some ways they did respond to that I mean the number of people running in twenty twelve it was Marco Rubio and\nTed Cruz from your state uh Jeb Bush you know what what happened do you think from that to the party I mean obviously Donald Trump happened but what what do you think has the party just completely shifted away do you think from that concerned about reaching out to people of color\n[noise] you know I Hope not because I think that it makes sense for both parties to to be engaged in trying to attract everybody right uh so I Hope not in that sense\nUm you know\nIt has moved away from where I Would hope that would be very clearly Trump is taken in the opposite direction of this is Gina phobia and trying to look what he's done with their care of and right now are basically trying to [noise]\nTo gin up support among his base uh by using this fear of the other\nAnd um the the but the answer to that is for people of different backgrounds whether you're Latino or you're white or you're African American or Asian American you know what what gives me hope\nIs that I see a lot of people that don't look like me advocating for people to do and because we have something more than the color of our skin binds us together it's these values of understanding and appreciation for difference and a belief that we can make our country better\nUm if we see past those things that separate us\nIn opposition to some of these leaders like Trump that are trying as hard as they can to to drive an ax through those anxieties and those potential divisions and you know people of of a good will of different backgrounds stand against er [noise]\nYou know ... here in California of course there are many Latino voters are especially in some of the swing districts that Democrats are trying to flip from red to blue a there was a report out today was in the New York times about how um in at least some parts of the country many Latino voters feel like they're not being\nA contacted by the campaigns ah talked earlier with somebody from the D triple C who dispute that but you know what do you think are the barriers to getting Latino out to vote in how motivated you think Latino voters are it is a the in this midterm election yeah I'm a little\nBit hard in because the last couple of surveys on this have shown that there's an uptick here toward the end I guess we gotta have eleven days right until the mid term um the thirty ninth congressional district is a good example of that down in southern Calif\nHead rise the retiring Republican there I had to let you know and in the south Korean immigrant\nYeah I mean it's you know it's a wonderful in terms of you know these these new generations of leaders are coming forward but a Latino interests there had been somewhat anemic and um and the latest gauge of that from the New York times shows that are that they're actually use more enthusiasm and people are paying attention and\nWill likely support the Democrat but just more generally\nI'm convinced that there needs to be a massive and sustained effort to register and to turn out Latino voters um\nBecause they can't just be the work of of of some campaigns and it can't just be just be done six months before the election and needs to be much more dedicated than that\n[noise] All right so we're going to take a short break and then we'll be back with ... Castro former secretary of HUD former mayor of San Antonio and author of a new memoir is called an unlikely journey and if you'd like to talk with him about the state of politics in our country give

materials on research factor affecting sleep including comfort in support humidity levels and the ease of breathing\nIs it fair to say that uh you know maybe more can be done at the state and local level because the federal government of especially now but it is in general just a big bureaucracy\nYeah well and it's the most will also fair to say that like your caller people had been working on this at the local and state level for a long time and they're dedicated to the mission and right now when there is an absence of federal leadership they are hope\nAll right ... thanks for the call let's go back to San Francisco and Rob you're on with whom am Castro\nThank you and good morning Mr Castro or this is just an opinion about uh the reason that immigration has not been reformed at the federal level and um you know we outsourced a lot of jobs to lower wage countries over the years but we've also in source a lot of jobs\nHere in the United states\nHere's but we've also in stores a lot of\nJobs here in the United states through the legal immigration to keep wages low so that\nCompanies can maybe make a little bit more money I mean farm workers are a little different 'cause a lot of people won't do those jobs but the main crux ... that the region illegal immigration has not been reformed is that illegal people will work cheaper than people that are here legally\nBecause of their status is that the reason that there is no um meaningful immigration reform is just to keep wages low for companies in the lobby Congress to keep it that way\nWell I mean I Will say that\nUh you don't often hear these Republicans talk about cracking down on the businesses that hire folks who are undocumented right I mean you hear them scapegoating individuals who are trying to provide a better life for their children and for themselves which is understandable and it's human nature especially if they're fleeing violence\nBut yeah I agree with you in the sense that it takes your willing companies some of which look the other way\nAnd I think that any kind of comprehensive immigration reform has to include I'm looking at better ways to ensure that when folks are hired a that that\nAre that they're documented door if you have a work program in place and that the regulations of that are followed but I Will say that you mentioned this\nA lot of these jobs when their farm worker jobs or\nUm or yeah other jobs you know it's tough asked folks these employers who have tried to get a citizens to apply for these jobs and and just to put a fine point on it they upped the wages you know they they pay them more than they normally would\nAnd they still can't get yeah maybe like a couple of people that apply but they still can't get the number of people that they need that's why we need comprehensive immigration reform that addresses\nThe making sure our borders are secure or does it end smart way but also deals with the fact that we have ten or eleven million people here who are undocumented\nAnd and meet the needs of an economy that we want to see continue to grow\nAll right thanks Rob for the call do you think ah that's comprehensive reform I mean there's a lot of talk from Democrats about what are Republicans need to give on dreamers and other things but you know what do you think Democrats should be willing to put on the table\n[noise] well I think um you know how we secure our border\nUm I think ah who\nAnd under what circumstances are they eligible for in her path to citizenship\nObviously and in um in negotiations on\nLegislation there'd be a lot of action around what does that look like is there going to be an earned path to citizenship or does it look like something else I Believe that there should be in a path to citizenship because I don't think that you want to permanent class of people here who have who cannot even if they were perfect\nResidents ever become citizens I just think that's a recipe for I'm I'm just unity in the country going forward\nWhat about looking at the overall limits illegal or legal immigration because there are some who say you know we should we can't really even legally ... except all the people who want to come to this country should that be on the table as part of\nAn old you always look at it they always look at the numbers of people that are going to be allowed in through the legal immigration process I think you know people often say which I can understand the sentiment behind you know you have a lot of people that say well\nLook my family came here legally week we played by the rules and then these folks want to get into the country then why don't they do that look I you know I get that sentiment\nYou know at the same time I don't think these two things are mutually exclusive I think we can address this issue that we have with undocumented immigration but also improve our legal immigration system because there's no reason\nThat folks have to wait you know eight ten twelve years or more\nGoing through that process and and as part of that you're going to look at you know how how many people you actually allowing that legal system\n[noise] All right let's go back to the phones and Brian in Santa Rosa your next welcome\n[laughter] Hi I'm Sorry uh uh the the legacy of assessment shove it and uh just pointing out that\nUh he he looked at immigration as being a threat to the wages of his she invited a farm workers and his organizing a ... so the point of view that's currently being\nThe scar stuff that the Hispanic support\nIllegal immigration and that your guest represent their interests on this at least to some extent is it's not true for people who actually want to see a wage increase and by the way the cost of picked ahead of was it ... served with labor\nThe supermarket you're paying about sixteen cents on the costs are three dollar head of lettuce is the wage for the worker and it feels tripled the wage you would barely notice that costs you'll be paying an extra thirty two cents per head of lettuce\nAnd when you do that you that actually can have Americans set aside picking the heads of lettuce rather than having an exploited under class and do it\nThat let me let me say I think I think Mr Castro's interest is the interests of some very gravy\nOr a owners are of me as far\nAs lots of let's give them a chance to respond to that and I would say you know that this has been tried in states like you're thinking was Alabama or Georgia or maybe it's been tried here in California\nOr read an interesting article I think a program from the sixties\nSponsorship indicate the lady live stream banks than any firm Comcast extending the Internet delivers in home life high for ultimately this and the home\nOf of California so I'm mean but just to be precise and the answer you directly year we could get folks from the United states who are citizens to fill these\nJobs um and if you can get these these companies to increase their wages I think everybody sees that as a good thing or it still might\nNot a judge who's ... and he was you know and yeah and\nIf there's evidence there's direct evidence that they can't get these folks uh can't get Americans to apply to do these jobs\nSo I don't think it has anything to do with supporting these corporations around a lot of these farms and gets\nYou know recognizing that you already have people here who are undocumented and they're trying to provide for their family and if you have a situation where the jobs are not going to be filled by Americans than does it make sense to ensure that\nThat they can be treated humanely and that if they don't break the law\nThat there's some way that they can earn citizenship yeah I think it does\n[noise] All right thanks for the call or here's a some listener comments your Charlie asks what ideas to Castro have for increasing Latino voter participation especially young Latinos in Texas where we have a very unexpectedly competitive a U.S Senate race against a Ted Cruz by ...\nIt's going to be fascinating to watch in eleven days because mental roar has visited every county in Texas or two hundred and fifty four of them a he has you know campaigned on trying to unify um\nCommunities instead of divide 'em Ted Cruz is not particularly well liked uh down there\nAnd nor as Trump really I mean yeah I mean for folks to know about Texas I Know a lot of Californians and especially here in the bay area I Would imagine as a former resident of the bay area\nUm you think of Texas and you think of like this very conservative state and people have different\nUm perceptions of it but Texas had the first or second biggest percentage point jump toward the Democrat of any of the states in twenty sixteen there are a lot of people in that state especially in the suburbs of Houston Dallas Austin San Antonio and especially suburban women that have had enough\nWith Trump and never liked Ted Cruz and the first place but maybe they voted for him because they lean Republican\nThat are abandoning that party right now that's why in congressional districts like the thirty second which Pete Sessions represents you I Believe that the Democrat is going to beat him over there and then we're going to have a couple of other pickups I think and with a strong wave\nI Do think that ah that the ... can be Ted Cruz\nDo Democrats have talked about the you know flipping Texas I mean how far realistically how far off do you think that is you know you know in a presidential election\nSo well Scott it could be eleven days away so who are needed in the natural I mean a lot of them do I mean you know so that at first they don't\nKnow I Believe that it that in twenty twenty that does that does well or especially if he wins that we can take Texas and my vision for the Democratic party is that we take\nSunshine in the forecast temperatures ranging from the upper sixties at the coast to the very low eighties inland it will be

them analyze them\nAnd they were able to pull a fingerprint off of one of the these bubble lied manila envelopes that fingerprints matched say ox\nAuthorities say there's also possible DNA connection

com\nAnd from the ISI MC foundation at ISI and the foundation dot org\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon\nNegative campaign ads have become just about as much a part of the season is pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael Franz who teaches\nPolitical science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ad these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pet\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\n[noise] you know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter suggests diseases and haunt you\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people in in question should be raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is that an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it is a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who's co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure we've been following a developing story all morning to a shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh that has left multiple casualties multiple fatalities according to authorities you can stay tuned to NPR as well as NPR dot org for the latest

teenage seven hours ... minutes is longer than the playing time of the entire\nNineteen thirty nine World Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to ... by max Muncie\nIn the bottom of the eighties Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there are men are you there your weight\nYeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game\nUnbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched\nUm [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen through Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks Sandy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home life by for all devices in the home\nIs absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best pitcher on the fields although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight [laughter] well the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox\nManager Alex ... still haven't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes Nathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer regattas a dealer dealers [laughter] if I was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games and for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw\nSeven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker bealer being started\nThen I does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ...\nThat's a good question to ask I either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but both teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong\nSo the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun Tom Goldman thanks so much You're welcome the dual\nBob Cousy and bill Russell was one of the greatest they were\nThe Tracy in ... in the
