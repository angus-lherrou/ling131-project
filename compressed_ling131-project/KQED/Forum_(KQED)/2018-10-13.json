I've never voted for Republican I I can say that\nBut the more I thought about it I realized that Reagan was definitely a bull loving to many many people in this country\nAnd um and it certainly he changed our political culture\nAh and I thought that would be a real challenge for me to put aside or any partisan take that I might have to uh to be objective ah and and you know my democratic friends thought that I had betrayed the clause and my Republican friends and I have more Republican friends that you might imagine\nBoth of my Republican friends that I ... I wouldn't have the objectivity and so that was a challenge for me and I I I really set about uh trying to see if I could bring him to life\nHow did some of your preconceived notions about Reagan change in the course of writing\nWell you know it's it's interesting people ask me if I Would vote for Reagan now after spending six years of my life working on this of\nCourse I'm safe too liberal to get the nomination of the current yet had already\nPerhaps that's true um I wouldn't vote for him now because you know I'm a Democrat or I don't adhere to was politics yet\nAnd uh they were separated themselves from the the democratic liberals and and really causing a lot of the unrest in Hollywood and that's when Reagan begins to pull away and he starts to ... to the right\n... talking with Bob spits his new biography is titled Reagan and American journey I'm Scott Shafer here today for Mina Kim and one of the things of course uh one of the big moments for Ronald Reagan in Hollywood was falling in love and Mary Jane Wyman who broke his heart in a way\nShe did break us hard I mean there are ... and his spirit in in a lot of ways as well that that marriage was a typical Hollywood marriage they didn't know much about each other\nThey were both working a separately in different movies um for a while they rarely saw each other but really what drove that marriage apart was the fact that Reagan would never shut up about politics\nUm it drove Jane Wyman crazy if he was on the set and there was a break and the takes Reagan would pull cast members together and talk politics if they went into the commissary for lunch the actors would wait to see where he sat down first so they didn't have to get an earful\nPolitics through art and at that point is politics were what oh they were they were to the left they will they will\nReally democratic politics yeah and and Jamie Hyneman couldn't take it anymore\nI remember when I was running for president there were a bumper sticker that said Jane Wyman was riding high now well there you have it yeah so uh so he at some point or where they get divorced but they've had a couple of kids yes Michael and Maureen\nRight yes Michael they adopted and Maureen was with the natural child and they um\nHere's why did they adopt Michael do you know with the story but\nThey know what nobody knows I'm a ... I I think James found out that she couldn't have children again\nThat was my guests are but I have no idea why they adopted Michael [noise] um and they always said you know there are too many children in the world which it adopt but uh nobody ever knew personally why why they did\nThat and they had a difficult relationship I think Michael and his father all through\nHis life I mean it it never stopped a Nancy really wanted nothing to do with Michael in Bahrain and in fact uh there's there's a quite an interesting story when Michael was graduating from high school\nA Ronald Reagan was Reagan was the speaker and as Michael comes up to get his diploma Reagan gives them the diploma shakes his hand and says and what is your name young man and he looks up and he said that it it it's ... it's Michael ... and that really sums up there we\nGo around him that he wasn't wearing his last ah so he's big break if there was one in Hollywood because you really never broke out in the way a lot of stars did of that era but he plays new rock need to give her in Nineteen forty or how did he get that role and and the you know what did you make of it\nYeah it ... the producer absolutely didn't want Reagan he wanted to anybody about race\nThe the producer absolutely didn't want Reagan he wanted anybody but Reagan because Reagan wasn't a star they really wanted to start [noise] so what Reagan did was he suited up in his own college uniform\nHe went into the producers office unannounced and he threw a few bullet passes on his own college they form and and the producer said okay you know ... actually he wanted to play\nBut um but he got the giver at never really realizing that the real give her was a rapper ... you know he smoked and drank\nHe had illegitimate children he he gambled on his own games that he played in so they kinda whitewash that but Reagan loved that role I think Ken of course the nickname stuck yeah the nickname stuck the give her\nA but I think he only had two roles that he was really proud of it was that and of course Kingsborough he\nBecomes a Screen Actors guild president the IT forty seven and a and a even at that point I think he was supporting still a Democrat right he was supporting Harry Truman leave us a and ... and so what was it the flipped the switch for him\nThat's actually an interesting story um he was friends with with Dick Powell and Robert Montgomery both of whom were were real conservative Republicans and they used to argue like cats and dogs all the time about politics um\nReagan never really adhered to what they were saying until he went in the service\nUm he worked in in how he was in the service in Hollywood making films for a for servicemen a training films\nAnd um he had heard while he was in the army that those who are in the army in World War one word for given their taxes when they came out so Reagan decides\nYou know I'm not going to pay my taxes because I'm sure they will forgive us when we get out and of course he was completely wrong and wound up with a tax bill to Uncle Sam for Ninety thousand dollars in those days an incredible amount of money\nI'm at that point Ronald Reagan feels that the government has its hand in his pocket and he starts to talk about two things big government which he despises now\nAnd paying taxes which are for the rest of his life\nHe wanted to cut taxes and and so at this point Dick Powell and Robert Montgomery start to really uh they they start to come on to him and and fashion him and he starts to hear what they're saying and graduate goes over to their side [noise] well\nAnd he ... his career ... fades out and he makes the transition to the national stage through General Electric cars they hired him to be a spokesman and he goes around the country giving speeches with some of the themes that you describe\nYou know I I think it was his favorite job of his entire life\nYeah he gets a job or extensively he's going to be the host of General Electric new Sunday night dramatic anthology show and he would come on and he would announce a you know who's in the cast and tell you a little bit about it but gee said part of the job that we want is for you to be our ambassador\nA and your travel around to all the big plants were\nThousands of workers are working and just talk to them see what's on their mind or talk to them about their lives Reagan loved this I mean there he was talking to\nWorking class people people very much like he grew up with he understood them he heard what they were saying and and these were people who became you know there were Democrats who became Reagan Republicans later on\nAnd that fast forwarding into the sixties he continues on this track the Republican Party ... comes out as a big proponent of Barry Goldwater of course gets the nomination teen sixty four Goldwater crashes and burns but Reagan comes out smelling like rose as he often did\nYeah some some very wealthy California businessmen who were behind a Goldwater\nAsked Reagan if he would give a speech on on the candidates may happen and of course this comes right at the time that Goldwater's kind of the sea is tanking\nI'm at Reagan does it because he he he not only believes and Barry Goldwater\nThe Goldwater happens to live next door to Nancy ... parents in Arizona and they were friendly so he gives this speech and it's a rousing speech Reagan eroded himself forever known as the speech\nAnd the California businessmen watch this and they say to themselves the wrong man is on the ticket and so they begin to groom Reagan for\nA run to a governorship\nAnd I of course he does run in Nineteen sixty six and uh it's funny because people throughout his career underestimated Reagan\nAnd Pat Brown who was the incumbent governor Jerry Brown dad Amos underestimated him and in fact would work behind the scenes to to make sure Reagan got the nomination because he thought he'd be easier to beat than George Christopher lose that era of San Francisco\nRight exactly right uh and and you know Pat Brown I'm ... who was trying for a third term I'm really blew up the entire thing by telling schoolchildren on camera that you know who shot Lincoln don't you an actor and that really had that destroyed as candidates out\nAll right we're going to continue our conversation with Bob Spitz and his book Reagan and American journey we haven't even talked about his governorship or his presidency\nBut we'd love to hear from you your memories of Ronald Reagan and how how they've changed Ben Thirty years since he left the White House eight six

governorship or his presidency [noise]\nUh but we love to hear from you your memories of Ronald Reagan and how how they've changed Ben Thirty years since he left the White House eight six six seven

performances presenting it sends\nPerson but it was too late to so what about how\nAnd how given he was in Hollywood I mean rock Hudson a came out uh with HIV I think in Nineteen eighty five and Reagan\nNever believe that rock Hudson was gay I mean he really what difference does that make um I don't know [laughter]\nBut I mean you're saying is so for Reagan was the difficulty he had been talking about it the fact that it was largely affecting gay gay man\nHe he completely believed it was a disease that only affected gay men and he um ... and in fact Pat Buchanan who was in his administration said to him quite infamous away um it's no more than measles and so they ignored it I mean they completely ignored\nIt well and as you write in the book I think he cut the budget tried to cut the budget for aids in eighty six he\nThink he cut the budget tried to cut the budget for aids in eighty six he\nDid and in fact it in his eighty six are addressed the nation he is about to say something about aids looks at his notes him just skipped right over it\n[noise] All right let's go back to the phones and pat in Sacramento welcome\nTo the state department of social welfare when Reagan when\nThey will hit [noise] ... ... about three years to get my little [noise] yeah\nWell I mean you're right you're right about that um [noise]\nHe ... like like with the AIDS epidemic here is tone deaf about people's needing this Reagan believed that he pulled himself up by his bootstraps why shouldn't everybody'd be able to do the same thing and you know ... that was incredibly short sighted of them are very short sighted\nAt the same time uh he signed a bill which he later regretted liberalizing portion in California\nYeah really fascinating you know why he was against abortion so I called the late Tony villains who was a similar men are from Beverly Hills who sponsored that bill and he told me yep Reagan absolutely was opposed to abortion\nBut he Tony told him\nThat was the studies they had done showed that sixty five percent of people in California favored therapeutic abortion so Reagan re read those studies and he said to bill and send\nYou know I'm opposed to it but I'm governor of all the people of California not just some of the people and so I'm I'm going to sign this bill he regretted it for the rest of his life but he did it and I thought that was remarkable governor of all the people of California yeah\nAnd I think was in his ... his father in law Nancy ... a father was a physician who gave him advice on that issue and told them to sign it as\nWell yeah exactly right Nancy was in favor of it as she was throughout her life yeah All right let's go now to ... in Berkeley Welcome\n[noise] can you hear me yes go right ahead yeah\nMy comment is like a train coming down without Reagan's legacy\nAnd yeah that is certainly how many people feel and Bob I mean he signed a bill that to close the mental institution which at the time I Believe was seen as a compassionate thing the problem was there was no nothing that came after it to fund programs and other alternative\nRight it was one of the first things he did as governor as a matter of fact and it was a disaster a he realized too late again that you can't just slashed budgets without worrying about the repercussions but um as I said if it was too late\nIt was it primarily because he wanted to cut the\nBudget he wanted to cut the budget ten percent across everything but they convinced him early on that um that the mental institutions really could be slashed further than that\nWell and ironically who tried to shoot him and killing who did shoot him and kill and try and sell them when they were the ones who had mental mental health problems himself yeah All right Leah thanks very much a let's read some\nComments your we asked folks on social media what they considered Reagan's enduring impact a couple of responses here Curtis says to me rag into synonymous with me generation\nA de tweets the budget deficit which you alluded to Bob and then another listener says trickle down economics America was duped into believing it would benefit the average worker Trump passed a similar bill and credited credited the wisdom of Reagan workers have yet to benefit\nYeah rarely I may not you know David Stockman a famous ... yeah and convince Reagan the supply side economics something that no economist in America really believed and\nWas the answer to all of our problems um I I guess about a year and a half later Stockman realized that it was completely wrong and he gave a very famous interview to the Atlantic\nAre called ... which they call the education of David Stockman and it basically hung the the policy out to dry right in front of the president if they had no idea this was coming and uh Stockman almost lost his job over and one\nOf the criticisms of Ronald Reagan was that he was sort of detached from the job that he wasn't really paying close attention or that he would go up stairs and put on the cameras at six thirty or seven seven whatever time it wasn't a lot of land to Earl five thirty ... you know watch bonanza reruns of Mission Impossible it means that ...\nYeah well I'll tell you it was it wasn't just that he was detached he didn't understand a lot of the policy of ... I always like to say that Ronald Reagan wasn't a deep thinker but his thinking was deeply felt a um [noise] I I think one of one of his strong points\nIs that he knew he was humble enough to know that he didn't understand complex issues so we hired very good people it's the one thing that Trump has not done but I Will say Reagan hired experts to give him advice and he was smart enough to listen to them one\nOf the things corps Reagan was best known for was his ability to give speeches he he gave some great speeches and I'm One of the speeches he gave was in Nineteen eighty six or when the space or the challenger disaster happened that blew up on Tom launch\nA and he gave a speech uh that really United the country let's listen to this one of the more famous lines\nThe crew or the space shuttle challenger hunter as for the manner in which they live their lives\nWe will never forget them\nNor the last time we saw this morning\nAs they prepare for their journey and waved goodbye\nAnd slipped surly bonds of it\nAnd certainly bones\nTo touch the face of\nThat speech of course famously written by Peggy Noonan right her his speech writer [noise] uh [noise] what did he Reagan see the presidency largely as a performance\nWell you know the one thing he knew how to do is use soaring rhetoric\nOr we hear it in that speech he knows what's going to connect with the people and uh uh I I think I'm his acting you know I think that being an actor and and we're seeing it now currently\nA reaches people who are either aren't well versed in politics but they appreciate the performance [noise]\nAll right let's go back to the phones and again the number is eight six six seven three three sixty seven eighty six if you have a question or comment for Bob spirits and we'll go to Palo Alto John welcome\nI find it really ironic that many of the things that are being said about Trump today are worth at about ... a very called Reagan or adults a warmonger reactionary professor\nOr you're going to set up ... her her ... her I remember that and the rallies millions of people across Europe the United states um Central Park et cetera than regular instead of World War II Korea court\nAnd that's a real legacy far more important than anything your callers have talked about uh with that he could get the opposite we brought the Cold War truly successful in peaceful conclusion\nOf and again ironically Trump is likely to do the same thing with regard to the nuclear standoff North Korea so it's it's funny how people's memories are so so\nActive yeah well remains should I think it's a little soon to write Trump's history but uh but Reagan of course did come in as a cold warrior um and it's kind of a Nixon goes to China sort of thing where he and Gorbachev really hit it off I Would before you respond to that I just want to play a cut\nFrom Reagan this is a very famous speech he gave in Nineteen eighty seven at the Brandenburg Gate\n... general secretary Gorbachev if you see peace if you see prosperity for the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe if you see liberalization come here to this gate Mr Gorbachev open this gates\n[noise]\nMr Gorbachev\nTear down this wall\nAnd the wall came down to ... years later yeah with the Koreans that it wasn't as well that yeah because he does the you know a lot of people say Oh yes it's because of with Star Wars and it through the Soviet Union into bankruptcy but but your\nYour caller was right I mean you know Reagan came into office as Romney rabid on a failure un yes exactly and uh you know famously saber rattling and calling the Soviet Union the evil empire\nBut um you know I when I wrote my biography of the Beatles I knew that the the Boogie Man and that book was Yoko oh no and I was wrong about that\nThroughout the whole weekend [noise]\n\nGood morning I'm Steve Fox you're listening to ...

abused by priests in six dioceses over which were presided he was also accused of covering up allegations against his predecessor D.C.'s cardinal Theodore ... character who resigned from the College of cardinals earlier this year [noise]\nThese are unsettling time for many of us Catholics no ... is a young man who grow up in Pennsylvania and one of Donald worlds diocese and moved to Washington DC this summer he joined us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it as a matter of fact on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about the Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kittens joke about oh you know priest molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about than what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever that newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd never been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ... and a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my faith in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teaching of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up\nAnyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell no I Do not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bike has a gym

com\nCertainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse the bishops and people whose names are plastered on church building\nBack in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for the the heartbreaking abused there was actually occurring to me it it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care [noise]\nDo you still believe in God are you a free flow person I Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I still have a faith and\nI just [noise] much less the connection between my personal faith and

creative writing at the University of Mississippi joins us now from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us\nThank you so much for wanting to talk to you\n[noise] when someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother's a incredible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch\nShe had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we go to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not\nMake much money she was dealing with what I Would call like shards of abuse\nAnd you know when I was around ... she started to uh with me when I didn't do\nRight and she would always say she was looked at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worse and I think that the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town from her partner also started to get regressive worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing to one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June ... from your mother the beatings that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of\nReally big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em any new eventually I started to start as a way of a tent in the hot and the symptom to disappear\nYeah in the book you kinda veer between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd it was sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police\nAs I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay with people when they see me as such a threat and I kept it up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nMan I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused ... wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating\nRoque my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me I'm sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I may from a particular date until another date probably for like six years went to\nA casino and it's hard to write about that it's harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about a new book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator in the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to eat right\nAnd especially if it's if it's a it's kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling most as my family is something\nThat we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read a teacher and my mother not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age\nAnd this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believed that reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and try to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nHere say lame in his book heavy and American memoir

Sacramento it's now ten o'clock\n[noise] someone in Manhattan is certainly covert action is a New Yorker WNYC studio ...\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour and I'm David Remnick when we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems and also the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is\nIf somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help British been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all Logan\nLamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy\nI enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election it started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems which ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election stuck in a stall dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentation and the\nThis particular search didn't turn that up instead I found it very seriously and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of agenda fire next to their name and I immediately thought wow that that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and lay found in all of that data dishonest him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen ... gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself would be a huge story but on top of that land also sound security hole to which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms databases and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIs Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza that\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be an attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the veteran just ration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromised the Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nIs right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers\nTo help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched\nThen more information started to trickle out [noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked\nAbout Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\nLook we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems in twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that\nForeign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence said the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of a national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines\nGeorgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot then there's also other machines which paper about those are all the computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter not to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet and I wonder if you just explain\nWhy it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop our regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming\nGets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep bunks that assertion which is that many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless mode and to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless\nModems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\nWe spent a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has\nTo do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections or whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data\nBase [noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls are they in turn county they use electronic poll books and people were showing up and they were being\nAnother way\nI'm Alone and see\nI'm going to miss the snow [noise]\nI'm going to miss the B um things that grow I'm gone tree\n[laughter] gonna miss [laughter] [noise]\nI'm miss the animals and I miss you ever want another way\nAnother way\nI Need to know the play\nAnd\nWill they have the need to know where\n\nThis one ... I'm going on and the other\n\nThing and all this ... um well when the when\nIt's been kissing me so long [noise] another way\nOr\nAnother what ah\nWhat other what\n\nWho's the beauty of beauty isn't it you do you ever say we checked in with a known about the songs that they do how much do tease out what the song is about\nOh I didn't know where you try I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change\nYou know but you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter] sixties than many moments in between ...\nAnd just how does this seem similar a different\n[noise] um it's just I couldn't have dreamed up\nAll the stuff I've been through and all the countries no dictatorships and uh you know I'm In through all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know that it's just you\nWhat we are facing in the administration is evil\nNow what we are facing in the administration is evil and it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you release me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life\nIt's you know which the year the bully and um do bully people now seems to be okay the lying no problem no perjury yeah not a problem I'm sure that that is a new normal\nAnd ... how does it change the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as you know proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to IT law oftentimes hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety [laughter] anxious about the state of the world which is terrible\nAnd so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial that that is great advice yeah and um don't expect much and keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary forget which one it was\nBecause the scene appears in so many documentaries of you singing at\nThe march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you visualize\nIn your mind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone in kind of lousy sound system and seen was a half million people\nOr whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and you know I think\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph\nI think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's sometimes that you were in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea I think festival a political moment yeah\nI'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like and you know they're just ... people\nAnd so I had a hint then oh this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever\nAnd in yours and mine yeah you you know this next song that you're going to do I\nWent to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these\nThese ... relatives of people who lost people in the church there in his in his slaughter and it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed\nUm that President Obama a when too it seems like a million years ago at times the idea of a\nOf a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only the crowd with him in the fields they feel like allies\nBut he's able to sing the song begins a song yeah that lifts people off as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering the song was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had down or in the future of this song just dropped out of the sky ... by the way Milford I did not know and most people didn't know and [noise] they need to tuna didn't get
