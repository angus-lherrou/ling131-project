advantage but you're pretty excited\nI Am pretty excited I Would be a even more excited if we were playing at the coliseum tomorrow night but hey at least we don't have to worry about whether clay would got the ... time to\nTo protect the field from the rain um a lot of attention to those tarps actually well yes I mean those those tarps as well but the ... on the on the seats came off all of them this season\nAnd uh it's it's really exciting to it's it's been something that are in the stands all season we keep sort of looking at each other and\nIn the stands all season we keep sort of looking at each other and saying gee do you believe this that we seem to be reading another game here it's amazing\nIt requires what a semi ... called a suspension of disbelief there's a lot of unlikely in his ear in fact Rick uh the beginning of the season people are saying well if they make five hundred there'll be pretty good for this team\nAnd I was one of those people saying that if you looked at the rotation coming into the season and it was I thought it was probably the worst and all of baseball and they lost all five of those guys and yet here they are so why were loving every minute of it especially as you said after three stray last place finishes\nWell also can't help but go back to twenty fourteen when they were a wildcard team also right before those three\nStraight years but they were the best the best record in baseball at that time and they had a lot of the not necessarily patched together a team that they have now\nThey have the best record at the all star break and then they made some very aggressive moves are trading their top prospect jobs and Russell they get adjusted to Marjah and Jason Hamel from Chicago and then they made the move to trade\nYou on a sense but it's to Boston to go to John last year and that kind of cut the heart out of the team and the AIDS survived the lab member work in this game is the last day of the season sunny greyhound to throw a complete game shutout against the rangers just to earn the second wildcard and then there was the catastrophe Kaufman as I call it because\nWell and that's an interesting example to recognize that are\nShown do little was my favorite player on the team for all the years that he played as a fan if I were given the choice between China do little in lake training I Would have I Would have Sean because I Love him but training has been amazing he's been he's been much better he's been\nMuch much more reliable than ah than do little\nBy the way I'll throw a leader in finishing her love for individual players yeah you've got to have like instead of major league record this year has oh seven eight you already has the lowest you already in the history of baseball for any picture to pitch over Seventy five innings let's go to our callers and we begin Matt from Lafayette was you could mourning\nMourning thanks for having me on\nA I just wanted to say one of the most exciting thing about it [noise] um they know how many people on the couch Stanford I grew up in the area\nAnd a market I mean and even the Scottie joining a team then than it is also local guys an exciting thing I think people I\nKnow it's a pretty cool thing when you think about it this is Rick do\nYes you've got it for ... or a valley out and pleasant and you've got Marcus ... who's from St Mary's high in Berkeley Bob Melvin course of the bay area guy and went to a lot of day on the green concerts or the coliseum went to Cal so it's a nice little local Aguilar\nAnd here's another local color Merrill joins us from Oakland, Maryland\nHi um I'm calling and asking um you know might not even if we can ever for Thirty years and I went to a playoff game in the early ... my dad and I remember the magic of twenty twelve and then twenty Thirteen and that disappointment twenty fourteen\nWhy do you think if there's anything that they can do tell like really\nPush it over the edge that the air\nGo ahead [laughter] hey thank you [laughter] um I think that\nThe magic is really there this year because when you look at the number of times that this team has come back um we've made jokes about the eighth inning and the eighth inning comeback late in games and has come back from\nYou know three four runs down and come back to tie and then eventually come back to when we've been doing less of the um pie in the face a walk off ceremonies this year we do it sometimes\nBut um it's the magic is is definitely there and this is a this is a team that does not give up\nNorth and and I I Hope you're right about that there's a lifelong fan the ... the three times before and the ... weren't emitted by the Yankees especially in Nineteen eighty one strike season they swept the royals and the first round that's because the first half way the second half winter but then they want the stadium\nAnd that was a ... a ... a series they got destroyed up two O. two more times during the big three years choking that away the gene or flip there's something about going to the Yankee Stadium that subconsciously or consciously can intimidate guys I'm with Nina thinking that they're not going to be intimidated but I Want to see it to believe it\nLet me bring another caller from Oakland non Denice that's you Hi\n[noise] Hi my thank you can really bring\nIn the morning I just want to say that I think that they are so much fun to watch the game you know my my aunt fern how are you at all\nI can do much one [noise] but then you know you drive a guy\nOn the whole like\nRight and I think you Denise isn't it\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October fifteenth MLA dot Stanford ...\nOrdinary talent uh you you you think about some really great players and now you've got some great players too but they're coming off of the three year drought\nWhile the ... that those teams in the early seventies that hall of famers at five straight divisions three straight World Series titles\nYou think about the big three in the early to thousands they were fantastic at this team I as I said ah I predicted it I I\nThought in a perfect world that they would be five hundred a little more scrappy they have youngsters who are a little ahead of schedule we didn't know that ... that's a ... and was going to hit my crazy in the second half he led all major league baseball and doubles and the second half second an extra base here it's\nA matter of a sudden we were kind of expecting more home runs we didn't expect him to be\nPlayed gold glove defense like he has but even the old guys like large thirty four and then the best season of his life like Nina said he only had four airs a whole year this is a guy who wouldn't even bend his knees\nIn the wild card game and twenty fourteen and he had Ninety nine RBI for a second baseman of his stature that's usually like a Jeff Cantor rind Sandberg type of guy jet Laurie is not a big strong guy\nNo budget Larry's that amazing season even given his past history um his a listener who writes I Love the age and I have for a long time it kinda bugs me however that we have traded away all ... teams worth of great players we are doing great with low payroll like Billy in the guise of one's gotten away with something\nBut I'm having fun watching them act like the warriors there is all that kind of warriors type experiment but people are still angry about these great players being traded away\nAnd they should be it's a defeat us mentality and for a long time they were doing it I think the sort of southern narrative that we can't afford them because we don't have any money and until we moved to San jose then we can start a forwarding and it's hard to keep a fan base that as soon as you get excited about a young guy especially got like a joke and it's all sort of Josh to Austin who still have three more years of team control and you trade them then\nSo I can understand why a lot of people turn their backs and say look calming you when you start holding on to those guys isn't that\nTrue though ah let me go to you on this new you know the day before the kind of had a plan and he went to the owners with it and they went along with it\nI I don't know that he did but I think that I think that that's probably true um but I think you know it's it's a difference in philosophy\nAnd you can look at a team like the giants who signed their great players to long term contracts and now they're stuck with some\nOld older guys who don't really have it anymore and uh people love them and they show up of remembering the great times that they had in twenty ten and twenty twelve that you know\nAn twenty four to and they have they have three rings to show for it and I'm getting at here for three a tweet from a listener so someone tell recognition of the Yankees just announced submariners or surf oh there you go\nAnd the ... knock him around last time and he also started last year as wild card game and they gave up three runs to the twins and was out in the first thing\nThat here's another caller from Oakland Dan Hi you're on the air\n[noise] hey thanks for taking my call man I Love that game I Love the way they hit\nI'll tell you what though man that that own Colosseum and one of the best kept secret in baseball I grew up in the bay area and it used to be the premier play the game you know you go to when they come out to the\nBeautiful hill I'm calling and now I'm going back again and it's ten bucks you got a whole road here so\nI don't want you know what I'm saying you\nKnow what I mean why are you grow up in New Jersey [laughter]\nYeah no I I I'm telling you I well I spent some time on the east coast I'm currently I think the February now and it's going to be a beautiful beautiful thing but\nI don't even\nKnow I thank you for that and says yes let me we've got ... you want to talk about a new stadium location go ahead\nYes I did the basic thing is I agree with that last caller first of all in the fact that the coliseum is that it's it's an excellent\nPark I live a mile away from it and I enjoy the heck out of it every time I go all but the main thing was I was I was just ... when they uh they announced they are out at college site and I thought that was going to be a wonderful site I don't think it was the\nOnly got ... seconds later good site protocol inside their view drift but it's dead now if I had this yeah Howard terminal will be great colors and all of them you say in the ground tomorrow at a quick comment from microbes\nAs it got to say I'm not that surprise you guys do this on a regular cycle they come out of nowhere and we'll go to a three four year run this was a fun team that is a team there was no ego and to explain in the early nineties the franchise drew almost three million fans this sustainable\nOh I Believe so to the top so that they always come back we're going to talk about\nSome criminal justice legislation lots of that lots to talk about say to them on Michael Krasny\nYou're hearing a rebroadcast of this morning's forum the second half hour is just ahead after we checked the road race this Tuesday night with kids in the western\nActually a tenth and he's All right good evening and I love to talk about ... right will start things off and rocket unfortunately as some\nBad news is accidents still causing delays and up to five vehicles involve west bound for right near the skyway and it is stopping do at least from McEwen also earlier accidents in the works for all those things look like they're just about wrapped up it was a big three vehicle accident right in the middle of the free way north bound one oh one it sir Francis Drake and we're still seeing some delays the\nRedwood City now construction starting to cause some problems south down one oh one beginning ran around Mars continue down towards university means you're being reduced and we're seeing some delays also an accident from Fremont three D. at those\nIf you're in there for a second you know robbery conviction right now automatically you would get an extra five years for each previous sell any that you had on your record this judge's decide you know hey in this case we don't think that's necessary or maybe we do\nAnd let me find out a little bit more about the transparency with you ... you know simply criminal justice reporter for kick you read the news a\nGood deal of a will there's been essentially a kind of shield when it comes to a officers behavior for a long time now I mean even things like charges of sexual assault lying on the job or planting evidence all those things are were shielded for the most part now\nThat's going to be transparent we talking also about a good deal of lobbying behind those ... example black lives matter groups like that was certainly\nI mean how to [noise] uh dozens of you know organizations like that like black lives matter of chapters in different cities or around the state um DAC owe you a state wide chapter Southern California northern California it has really been United around\nNot just a a Nancy scanners a Senate bill fourteen Twenty one but a years long legislative effort to try to change\nSort of the the status in California and in the instance as you mentioned because it's not\nThis legislation is not wholesale it doesn't mean that all police personnel files all records of misconduct are now subject to public records requests it's narrow where it only gets at ... findings and investigations uses of deadly force\nSustain findings meaning an investigator looked into it and said this appears to be true about a on duty sexual assault and official dishonesty lying in police reports tampering with witnesses a evidence and um perjury\nWhat would you mentioned inclusive this brings to my mind the fact that the bill with respect to forty five days on body cameras are they talking about using body cameras ordinary police work to build up trust within the community that sort of\nWell then what I hear your time and time again and I think why this bill might have resonated with legislators who are are really starting to show a changing perception around police accountability and transparency issues in particular\nIs you know you talk to people on the street and they say what is the purpose of my police department rolling your body cameras if we can't see the video when it matters most when we are uh you know when we have a concern when there's public concern\nAbout an incident oftentimes a deadly incident and I think as you know over the past few years when we've seen\nA starting with major departments and now many departments in California adopting body cameras it's very um inconsistent between departments and really between incidents whether video will be released a there was a a an interesting case in Oakland just the other day released\nVideo from a a fatal officer involved shooting three years um after that incident a much longer than this forty five day time on it\nSo I think you've got to cut hair Alex you want to tell us about it I mean it has to do was unintended consequences\nRight um and and that's just a little bit of ... so we're talking about two separate bills that are addressed transparency and I found the California police chiefs associations um position on both of those these are major a city police chiefs throughout the state\nUm they supported this bill that we're talking about opening up certain misconduct files but they were opposed to the bill that would create a timeline for releasing body camera video I talked to a police chief David Swing who is also president of that organization and he said\nThis was going to be a major costs to try to turn around the release of body camera videos in these complicated investigations that often aren't going to be done by the time that they're that departments are going to be required to release these videos and he said basically it may\nCause police departments to think twice about adopting a program or start thinking about closing their body camera programs\nIt would not surprise me if over a period of time if we see a decline in the number of new agencies are adopting body one camera and possibly some agencies are currently have ... on camera that might pull away from the program if the time constraints of the resource demands become too onerous\nAnd interestingly that's also an argument against ah the misconduct files being released um basically that smaller agencies don't feel like they have the resources to address it ah the the the bill's author says look these are on a narrow amount of records it should be something that the department's can absorb\nMore so let me give us a phone number because we've got a shorter segment here and I know people want to weigh in and give you the opportunity to do that we're talking about the governor's signing sweeping criminal justice reforms into law with a ... and ... Marshall Law goes in with your listeners if you have questions or comments\nPlease feel free to join the program you can do that right now at our toll free number it's an eight six six seven three three six seven eight six we welcome your involvement the number to call eight six six seven three three six seven eight six or email us\nFor them at ... dot org or go right to our website and post anything you care there can be done orange flesh forum or tweet us our Twitter handle is at stake reformers who you're going to say\nOh I just I I was struck when I heard Alex as news report this morning with ... you know police kept talking about the costs because I don't think that's actually the major argument they made against these cells to lawmakers\n... it's not an editor saying they're right they sort of change tactics um you know which is totally totally within their rights but I think that what they were saying to the lawmakers more with us about protecting police officers and that that was you know\nSort of unfair and that you know police officers could be targeted if you open up more records and they also mentioned Alex I think in any and fix it is that they may go back and try to get these over turn next year and the legislature and we'll of course have a new governor and\nI think it'll be very interesting to see what the what the mood in Sacramento around these issues more broadly not just police misconduct but um\nYou know criminal justice reform under a new governor under a you know any legislature arguably and then you know we could you have to couple that with the fact that the police misconduct bill\nAnd I mentioned by surely Weber of San Diego who wants to change basically the legal you know parameters around when it's OK to shoot someone that they have promised to come back to the table and not all sides and so I think it'll be kind of interesting to see\nWhere we start they the you're at and given that you do have eight years of pent up frustration from lawmakers his bills were vetoed around criminal justice and beyond [laughter]\nWell you mentioned a little earlier that there's also a juvenile justice a bill in the last couple of them in this whole package and I'd like a quick rundown and that's what our listeners know can respond to it because as you said it's been an hour on a village to it as fast as we can\nSo basically I'm two major bills that I did on that one makes it so you can't prosecute kids under the age of twelve unless they accused of something very serious like rape and murder so essentially saying if you're eleven and under that\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October fifteenth MLA dot Stanford ...\nFor crimes and the governor had a pretty veto or I'm\nSigning message on that essentially saying that he really struggled with it and we agonize yeah but he said that ultimately you know we should have a system that respects victims but also the path of redemption\nI think the agony came in governor Brown's part over the fact that he is looked at all the numbers and he realized that there was a racial former mayor of Oakland silver\nRacial a disproportionate number of those who are being tried and convicted and put it in the penitentiary also looked at ... younger people are who are put in the ... century or more likely to be lifetime criminals so those things way down a major way let's have our listeners way and now let's begin with an Oakland color Allan you're on the air good morning\nYeah get just a quick comment on body can I'm a dog fur and rubber has a camera has\nJust full of what they\nWere voting\nAllegedly real information is going to be a an idea that's for a living\nAnd have for decades and they they imagery Joel Grey is going to be what the individual what ... what they\nI think it points to a point well worth taking a an Alex you want to come and\nYeah I I think there's a couple of different ways to look at that it's absolutely true that sort of I I Would I Would cast it as the cameras\nViewpoint is limited to where it's pointed right and obviously to the caller's point a police officer depending on most of these are just melted so where their chest is facing is where the cameras more or less likely to be pointed\nAnd I'm In every example that I'm aware of of officers do have\nThe sort of discretionary ability to turn the camera on and off in certain circumstances so in some ways it has to be enforced policy is enforced after the fact if an officer is supposed to have a body camera on\nAnd ostensibly recording whatever it is that they're doing 'em and they don't then there can be discipline out of that but that wouldn't be disciplined that we wouldn't necessarily ever find out about because it's not something that would be a\nReleased even after uh the new uh misconduct a bill takes effect\nWho's a listener who writes and let me thank you Alan for your call or another call in just a moment a listener might just curious about what a

you know watching election returns in a hotel room family and friends\nAre and are just been declared the winner I had just beaten the sitting lieutenant governor is affordable you know\nPolitician in California uh I and gosh ah this is the first time I've I've ever you know health statewide office super exciting my daughter about twelve years old at the time comes up to me right when I was declared the winner looks up at me and says\nInsurance commissioner\nIs this the most boring job in the state of California and I hope Rebecca is not listening today because she'll have More Ammo to tease me about but Michael I loved being insurance commissioner\nFor two thousand seven to two thousand eleven\nAs you noted a it is a super important consumer protection\nPost it no longer reports to the governor hasn't been that way for Thirty years there is no insurance commission there's just one person one insurance commissioner fourteen hundred employees overseas like three hundred billion dollar insurance sector and that's just absolutely\nHuge every decision made by the insurance commissioner ripples around the state the country in the world it's the fifth largest insurance\nMarkets in the world and it really matters who's at the helm of this complex department\nSo tell us why you running I Know you have kind of a choice of things that you consider most important the health insurance rates and fraud and cyber security I mean those are the main things motivating you\nWell on the ...\nYes there's a lot of issues facing the state of California now where there's some connection with insurance\nOut the wildfires first and foremost states on fire sadly hundred and thirty million dead trees out there ... there's going to be a whole host of insurance issues in the home owner's insurance space and that's the last thing that the housing market needs in California are large spikes\nIn homeowner's insurance or homeowners insurance companies you know completely you know bailing out of the market completely and so I I I I dealt with these issues before and two thousand seven to two thousand eleven terrible wildfires back then\nI really want to work on a set of mitigation strategies as well as continue to focus on a disaster recovery when someone loses their home on their house burned down you know I've walked through the rubble of people's homes hundreds of times nothing worse and helping them get back up on their feet if\nAnd this is why it's important to have an insurance commissioner those kind of quite frankly look out for the consumer it is important to have that market balance but at the end of the day we're we're seeing\nA homeowner's losing their insurance having to uh search uh for international markets to be able to ensure their home a that is a reality for so many people in the bay area now and the fact is that you know as insurance commissioner my number one priority is to protect consumers are given what is happening now at the\nFederal level where our president continues to dismantle\nThe federal protection agency a it is California is left on a NF California Department of insurance being the largest consumer protection agency and the state uh when you don't have somebody who's going to have an eye for California and not the industry\nWe need to hold the industry accountable we have to make sure that uh they are fair under honest with the consumers especially now as we know that ah these wildfires are going to continue to happen and they're going to happen at an unprecedented rate\nBecause they are very very different than what we've seen before I'm talks on work with the insurance industry actually on this legislation because they also recognize that there's new information out there there's new technology there's new ways of of capturing data to make sure that we now put we have to protect these consumers\nAre at a higher rate if given the new normal and so you know this is again demonstrating how I've worked with industry with consumers to pass legislation to make sure that we are at the end of the day get the right data we need the opted they did with the most up to the technology to make sure that we protect consumers and that's a you know why I'm running for\nThis little suddenly let me ask you because I ask you before what about the under insured I said see poisoners none of the whole campaign to try to educate the public about keeping up with their insurance and working with the industry or what do you propose on that\nKnow the under insured issue is a massive problem which a no other insurance commissioner has been able to solve in my conversations with\nUh the industry is trying to figure out not only how we educate folks but how do then we go back to the individual that has a specific policy suspicious specifically folks who inherits property or folks who are starting out with their new home and understand now that they might be\nIn a potential flood zone or in a fire zone now that you know would be unprecedented\nSo as we move forward\nNot only has the education important but we need to engage the insurance industry to figure out when is it appropriate for them to outreach to folks to make sure that they understand that the policy they have is a starter policy uh or that\nWhen they make all innovation when they make changes to their home that they understand what they're um uh opportunities are than half the policy at the end of the day we want to make sure that people have the information so that they make\nKnow they want to make sure that people have the information so that they make the right decision for themselves or are they you know continue to 'em out to their property or continue to live in areas that are in danger of a climate change\nSince you mentioned that I Want to go back to Steve Poizner and Steve Poizner you're talking about higher rates were those in higher risk areas as opposed to subsidizing what do you mean\nYeah um I if I got to go back to one thing here and then I'll get to that question too but\nA recording said that you know he's the one that that the consumer protection oriented person and and what then why is he taking insurance company money there's only one of us who are completely independent of the insurance industry and I don't\nTake and I'll tell you what I was going to ask them never kind of a quick response from you on that I didn't get\nA ticket for this race any insurance money and it's unfair to say that I take a short funny I'm In my past campaign for having this campaign I have not\nOkay let me go back to see poisoners than\nUh well if if if you can look it up there I was ... the ... I absolutely\nAgree with record I was at the most important thing about uh the insurance commissioner posters consumer protection\nIs all about consumer protection because when you have a problem with an insurance company good luck because they have an army of lawyers and as you and the insurance commissioners empowered to to fight for consumers and make sure that insurance companies fulfill all their legal obligations\nThe reason I have received every endorsement of every newspaper so far including the San Francisco chronicle the San jose Mercury News\nThe bay area news group the Sacramento Bee the reason why Twenty one for Twenty one newspaper second Dorsey in this race is that they looked at my track record\nIt's easy for politicians to talk about what they're going to do it's another thing to be able to examine my track record and recorders and newspapers north and south liberal and conservative hundred percent agree that I'm the one who did an amazing job\nFighting for consumers the last time I was insurance commissioner and running as an independent you know makes makes perfect sense\nAs long as we're talking about track workers I have to ask you because I and I read all the endorsements and they\nYou know give you real props over three thousand or insurance fraud cases a savings of about two billion dollars in lower rates and so forth\nThere's a lot there but there's also a and it keeps coming up and you can express contrition Ford openly when you campaign to try to run for governor of California wanting to have lots of Meg Whitman God I'm you came up with some pretty by many people's lights a harsh statements about\nImmigrants in control of immigrants in so called the undocumented people and uh you know and that makes a lot of people who are reluctant to trust you say something about that\nYeah well thank you yes so recall that talked about his background you know I'm a second generation immigrant\nBoth of my grandparents came here from the Ukraine where they're going through a ground you know a hundred years ago and\nIt coming to the United states you know save their lives through Ellis Island the statue of liberty and they didn't have access to a health insurance either back then when I came across and so I'm I'm proud to be a second generation immigrant as well or the ... the ... ten\nWhen the state had twelve percent unemployment\nI came to the conclusion that we really should have as large of a legal immigration pipeline as possible I've been always a\nMajor advocate of expanding guest worker programs in H. one B. visa programs but in two thousand and I took a some positions that will you know we should also turned magnet Fox because you know with twelve percent unemployment that there's a serious issues\nWe were talking about you're talking about keeping immigrants whose our schools and medical care I mean there was some stuff that was proceeding very harsh\nRight and I ... and looking back now I I Would do it differently I could come to different conclusions and I do regret company that those conclusions\nBecause those conclusions you know really would make matters worse not better my my my positions today is that everyone who's in California whose undocumented should get on a path to become documented and by the way I also point for people who are trying to figure\nFigure me out on the issue when I was insurance commissioner back in two thousand ten or the insurance industry came to me asking for permission\nWhat do we do about all the undocumented drivers in California\nUh shoot what should we do and I said absolutely positively you have my permission provide them homeowners excuse me auto insurance because that's good for them and good for the state of California and so that you know with these Twenty one newspaper endorsements that I just recently have obtained in the last month or two\nThat I mentioned they all you know looked at my entire track record and background and come to the conclusion on far the most qualified here and when you look at my entire life track record that I've been a really able to be a major contributor to helping California move forward\nBut I Want to bring our listeners into this and let's do that now you can join us with any questions you have for either or both candidates are we do want to hear from you and\nYou can join us at our telephone

visit our website ... dot org slash for um [noise]\nNo other insurance commissioner has been able to really cracked the code when it comes to making a our department of insurance much more efficient and this is why technology become so critical\nYou're seeing now in his shirt tech industry that is customizing specific policy for individual and this this is the exciting time and this is talk so I'm hopeful for the insurance industry because you're having these disruptions coming in\nAnd really I'm putting pressure on insurance companies to be more transparent but to be able to conduct their business in a way that's much more efficient for the consumer which is exactly\nWhat the caller is talking about and the insurance industry the department of insurance have to do their fair share as well we have to make sure that we use technology to the best of opportunity to make sure that we have the ... the customer and the consumer's experience\nAnd the department of insurance is different and should be able to do that is\nWell within ... says he has the technology background or when he argues that he has all the backing of the newspapers in part perhaps because of that you say what\nI say look at the other day I have the experience of protecting consumers and a clear record of fighting for every California and that's what's going to put me over the top notch newspapers more of our callers\nLet's go next to Don and looks for Don you're on the air\nOn that and very sick child and he the al ... a lot for in ... county and on\nEvery plane that file added network I get half of where they will get like three or four times when I read that and I in this day and actually many of these claims stay and although the person is getting paid for their time and the insurance personally not ... they're not I'm not getting paid for my time in that\nMany like three or four hours just to get a one hundred dollar\nThey hold on I mean who have no ... and a lot of that debate marketable long enough and they pay the person well enough that the customer service and they've made money you know at the end\nI thank you for that question and I think it's important one I'd like to hear first new senator learn and thank you\nAnd I apologize for that experience again but this is the problem with past assurance commissioners that\nHaven't been able to be able to effectively moved these claims quickly as possible and investigate them\nWe know and your experience is proof positive that health insurance company the entire model to make money if the deny you care and we've seen this over and over again so we're gonna have to make sure we get somebody who's not afraid of the insurance companies\nWho's going to make sure we hold them accountable and that we get to a point where we we we put doctors conditions back into a who's deciding that type of care treatment you're getting and making sure that on our and with the department of insurance that we make sure that we not only ah\nGet get your claim process of quickly as possible get you on that sort of get the investigation going and this is an ongoing problem this is why it is important to have\nFolks that are going to continue to keep the department accountable and keep the shrimp companies accountable as well but we know that the current model that we have does not work because it is literally putting a big insurance company against your family and who's going to win in that fight\nIt's always gonna be the insurance company let me go to UC poisoning\nYeah I you know when people campaign it's easy to to talk about what they want to do or whatever I mean I had when I was insurance commissioner you can look at my relationship with consumers and how I fought for them with\nThese health insurance companies three really quick example Blue Shield\nUh canceled thousands of people's health insurance improperly including one one and young women with breast cancer going through chemotherapy they canceled her insurance because she put the wrong weight on her medical insurance application that's just wrong and I uh\nOrder it required these insurance companies to reinstate thousands of insurance policies and find them millions of dollars and that that takes a great skill to go up against their army of lawyers Blue Cross in two thousand and one in raising a health insurance produced by thirty nine percent I\nExamine their application for that found a ton of mathematical errors and they ended up raising rates by single digits that year in the final example I gave in terms of track record in the United\nThe largest health insurance company in the country huge insurance company here in California they they acquired Pacific care and other health insurance company here\nPromise not to lay off any body so that the service levels wouldn't change\nWithin weeks after the acquisition ah they laid off thousands of people complaints went through the roof on the on the on the hotline which by the way is one eight hundred nine two seven\nHelp that see your call out there if you've ever had problems with your insurance companies are questions call the ... department of insurance hotline they're great people there that will help you but when United\nOr is that what you would recommend for this caller just took all the hard line what would you regardless of the next\nStep and let me just say with United healthcare I launched the largest enforcement action against any insurance company in the country when they when they're service levels plummeted like that so it takes an insurance commissioner with the skills\nAnd and and the desire to make sure these insurance companies fulfill their obligations and yes call one eight hundred nine two seven help if you're having a problem with your insurance company today that lived apartment of insurance hotline\nSee let me go to a question from a listener Kurt who important question he says people building in flood zones fire areas in landslide areas are taking more risk to text cover their losses when\nThe new one disaster his I'd like to hear each candidate we'll hear from you perceive a describe how they would balance risk versus premium cost and who decides insurance commission the companies the market\nPremium cost and who decides insurance commissioner companies the market\nWhat ... what I Believe is that people shouldn't be subsidizing other people that people you know when they're buying insurance they should be\nPaying the premium that is associated with the risk of their situation so if you if you live in downtown Sacramento you shouldn't be subsidizing people who live on the beaches someplace and so it's a very important that the insurance companies do price the the\nThe insurance product appropriately and so then when people build in areas that are more dangerous than a ... that they take into account what the real risk is when they're making those decisions in their ... paying\nThe right price for insurance I remember dealing with one person in San Diego during the two thousand seven fires\nWhose house burned down three times in the same little wind tunnel canyon in San Diego he was thinking of building this in his house to get in there for the fourth time but the problem is his rights had been been artificially kept low and he he needs to be paying the fair market\nRate so that other people around the city California aren't subsidizing that person's decisions\nLet me go to the same question you center learn\nAbsolutely you know people should not be subsidizing ah other people who are living in in the sensitive areas and quite frankly part of our campaign strategy here is to also working with local governments the fact is\nThat we need to talk to our local cities and counties for allowing to build in these um environmentally sensitive areas and if you're going to do so they should be paying the appropriate rates\nSo as insurance commissioner look we\nHave the authority to regulate um these rates but additionally what we need to do is go far beyond that and that's actually start having conversations\nAnd with the legislature and with local governments about local planning issues and you know making sure that people are not being allowed to build in these areas that are going to be much more constantly when the next fire flood hits\nAgain we're talking with insurance commissioner candidates Carter learns Steve Poizner and here's Casey Casey you're on the air good morning\nYour morning thinks I'm I've been an independent contractor for years and years working with high tech company and\nFor the past several years the requirement\nThat uh that have sprung up around compliance and insurance have just gotten more and more and more difficult it might have started as an legislation to try to protect people like me from corporations using us like full time employees but then not hiring up but what's happened in compliance industry sprung up\nAnd it seems like there in in cahoots with the insurance and will incur who's with the legislators it looks that way I don't know that it is but it's squeezing independent contractors in a way of forcing them to go work troop placement agencies and get paid much much less money\nThe poison I\nYeah I I I I I liked the idea of independent contractors having\nThat as an option and we shouldn't take that option off the table for people who want to work for a variety of companies for a variety of clients and for whatever the reason they just don't want to be a full time employee and I I I I Would I Would love to be a strong advocate of making sure independent contractors have have have a way to make ends meet in the state\nThe sign of how you stand on this kind of ...\n... you know the issue of independent contractors is very complicated ah for one how do you see companies who utilize them as classification of independent workers to not pay federal wages and to not pay health care cost the other component to this as folks like or something for trying to you know I'm\nWork independently and and work on multiple multiple jobs or multiple issues and so the fact is again this is why having an insurance commissioner who's going to make sure that insurance industry is honest transparent and\nEnsuring that we are being fair with the rate structure he'd given this new phenomenon right as independent contractors continue to grow it becomes unimportant part of our economy ... to me you are not going to be a how you ...\nJoe's report brought to you by the alarm in support for cake you

for a best seller team of rivals the basis for Steven Spielberg's Academy Award winning film Lincoln\nAnd she joins us in Studio for this for a while and good to have you back well thank you glad to be here the light is in fact in the ... let me begin by saying you are grappling with some big questions here and that's an understatement uh [noise]\nIt's like a nature nurture our authors assuming our our leaders born or made or to the times make the leaders leader make the times these go back actually just for a personal note to your youth you're on a path pretty early\nI think what happened is when you're in graduate school those are the wonderful nights when you're thinking about these huge questions as you're reading Plato and Machiavellian Aristotle\nAnd you start asking where does ambition come from which the proper form of government you know does the times make the man or the man make the times these are the kinds of things we'd sit around in rather ... has to be with drinking wine or beer at night\nBut I've always been interested in and I think the main thing was they would ask now how much beer exactly exactly how much did your rank and what else did you do it while you're drinking and we're talking about the boring wonderful things\nBut I think what happened as well as I usually decide after I finished one person\nThat I have to move all his books out of my office one president to make room for the next and I would feel a little bit betraying that person who I'm leaving behind I feel guilty about moving from Franklin to Lincoln or from Lincoln to teddy untapped\nSo this time I decided what if I keep my four guys together and and look at them in a different way through the lens of leadership and they all lead in turbulent times\nAt them in a different way through the lens of leadership and they all lead and turbulent times but I had no idea how relevant the title leadership and turbulent times would be when I started\nThen we'll get forgot title in terms of our president a chief executive and time here because we want to hear your thoughts on that\nBut this was also um you got your quartet together here are these four presidents who as you say in your book you've spent many many hours a week there was a serious researcher day and night and go to bed with woke up with and so forth but also was fired by a student who asked you about leadership how can I be leader\nThat's right I've been generally going out and talking about leadership lessons from the White House depending on which book I had finished at the time and young students stood up and he said but wait how can I ever aspire to be one of those leaders there already on Mount Rushmore they're already on our currency it's too remote so I decided I Would start the book\nWith each one of them running for office for the first time when they're twenty three twenty five to twenty eight\nAnd they're going to make mistakes they're going to fail they're going to screw up and a lot of ways they're going to be arrogant and have to soften that are against the kind of struggle just like we do so that a young person reading it could follow the trajectory of leadership and and see themselves along the way and see the choices they made and think about it in terms of themselves I thought it may make them more relevant for them\nAnd that same thing happened when the hurricane occurred and instead of worrying about the hurricane that was in North Carolina he\nStarted mocking the idea of how many people had died in Puerto Rico and less people he said had died and they claim to die of a paper towels in Puerto Rico now it's it's a it's a quality that allows you to connect to other people to see other people's points of view\nAnd in a big democracy as diverse as ours it's essential I mean I think along with humility what humility means is acknowledging Arabs and learning from your mistakes\nAnd there was a comment at one point he made that he would acknowledge mistakes if he ever made one but assuming that he might not make one\nWhich is also a someone who said I can fix everything I mean there's just a sense of what you outlined his leadership qualities you're talking about people who want to eventually uh grow and mature in a way that they want to save others and worked for the greater good and it just doesn't fit\nIn fact there is a direct opposite to that idea if I can fix anything and Teddy Roosevelt when he first got into the state legislature he\nToo like Trump like to be in the middle of things you know they always used to tease about him that he wanted to be the bride at the wedding the baby at the baptism and the courts at the funeral hee hee hee saver that central role that Trump does and he was a colorful figure like Trump he\nCould probably be a president in today's world he could definitely do tweets Seattle those short saying speak softly and carry a big stick\nBut the difference is that he grew in office he grew out of that kind of self absorption when\nHe was in the state legislature he would constantly be yelling and pounding his death firing against his opponents with ... making headlines you became a very famous states that Senate state legislator right away but then he realized\nI'm getting nowhere I Alone can do this I Alone can fix that I Need these other people to cooperate so he he just softened his history on rhetoric and he made friends and he was able to get something done but that's how the growth in office has to take place\nSoil so how does your point out the ability to listen to other people and that's an important part of leadership is defined it as well and not necessarily follow his negative impulses which is certainly a problem that our president chief executive has totally Teddy Roosevelt though because people are probably wondering\nA Lincoln civil war United union all that I'm thinking of LBJ she said was civil rights and uh well for that matter or other legislation and he was able to put through and they identify um [noise] uh FDR was World War two and with the depression\nTeddy Roosevelt though I mean you talk about rising industry and you talk about the coal striking let's put this in perspective I mean these are extraordinary stories of people don't necessarily have that much with whom are familiar with\nYou know you know in some ways the industrial revolution at the turn of the twentieth century has the patterns that are most echoing for today\nUm you had the first time that you have a gap between the rich and the poor because suddenly these millionaires have arisen and for people who are living in tenements there's a sense of conflict between people in the rural areas and the cities\nThere's a sense that the whole economy has been shaken up with all these new inventions the pace of life is going much too quick with telephones and telegraph and automobiles and there's a sense of people wanting to feel life's life's not like it used to be so there was a populist moment at that time\nAnd and there was real real violence between the wage workers in the capitalist or lots of nationwide strikes on they were bombings in the street\nAnd Teddy Roosevelt came in and what he did smartly was the arc argued for a square deal or a square deal meaning for the rich and the poor the capitalist and the wage worker so he took down some of the big companies that weren't following the rules of the game he smashed them\nUm he got railroads regulated he regulate some of the industry\nBut he was able to keep his Republicans along with him because he mobilized public sentiment to say we have to deal with the worst aspects of the industrial order child labor ... minimum wages um and he really was able to contain all that energy and it was in the industrial revolution fighting and came away very effective president\nBut the culture I was also really quite violent the news it'll bring people into the White House says go face to face and the Jews\nAnd the amazing thing was that President had no power at that time to even intervene in a strike between labor and management because that's all private enterprise what is the government doing here so we have to pave the way to even invite the two sides to the White House and then they had a huge jargon\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's

Baron showed them up so badly that public sentiment they were saying terrible things even took teddy insane to the minus I'm Talking to you you work with your hands they got published that night and sentiment that meant wildly in favor of the miners and that helped the cold parents to say but we better solve this we're not doing too well in public relations\nSinging containing anger about what Don McGahn or the president's private attorney said about the president compared on the king Kong in terms of the\nAnger is there some kind of family treated these four presidents to I mean you're talking about the square deal and of course we associate FDR with the new deal but it just looking at their idols and their mentors at home they looked up to the most to talk about the yeah\nI don't think I realized until the end what was so interesting if you start\nUp ... with LBJ his political hero was FDR in fact he called him his political daddy it's wonderful the early meetings between the two because FDR saw something in this young bronco LBJ in fact he said at one point if he said if I Franklin Roosevelt had not gone to Harvard this is the kind of unconventional politician I might have been\nAnd he predicted if the south ever had a president that might be LBJ and the two of them really got along well just from those early meetings and then FDR's hero was Teddy Roosevelt he had known teddy since he was young because they were distantly related and Eleanor of course was the niece of Teddy Roosevelt\nEleanor who you called the secret weapon\nNo question I mean you know one of the things you want when you're building a team is that people who are strong minded around you who can argue with you and she was his secret weapon she was what he called his darn authority and it's a high always willing to argue with I'm always willing to question his assumptions that she sent so many memos to general Marshall\nAbout discrimination in World War two that he had to assign a separate general has only task was to deal with Eleanor Roosevelt\nAnd then she had weekly press conferences only female reporters it comes to an entire generation of female journalists got their start because of Eleanor Roosevelt press conferences\nShe's amazing but back to the family tree I mean yes so so then Teddy Roosevelt is the hero for Franklin routes about\nAnd then what Teddy Roosevelt zero is ... is is Abraham Lincoln in fact in the middle of\nUm of of a terrible time for that call strike he's reading the ... volumes of Abraham Lincoln's on biography by a nickel and hay and he's often thinking what would Lincoln do at this moment I'm between the radicals and the conservatives and I need a Middle Way that's what Lincoln always dead and he would quote him he would talk about him\nAnd then Lincoln's hero was George Washington the founding fathers our whole country it's banned with this family tray and it was really fun to think about that shows what a short history our country has\nAnd I think sometimes of George Washington father of our country as a kid growing up we learned he never told a lie and we learned the Lincoln was honest Abe in every president now who were being reading about lying that has a\nA sort of done in an almanac records in rural Dominic records almost on a daily basis but let me do this let me invite you our listeners to join this conversation questions or comments about these four presidents were about leadership will get to that question about our leaders made are born I've asked I think every historian risk especially recently\nUh we had the uh the lightning pleasure of having ... four and\nA and a a gym that's going to ... chips first day John John meet them and saying oh we're both on and are these things happen for the broadcasters from time to time\nA ... and I asked a question about you know history and the great men and especially unfortunately we're all great men uh up until\n... still great man in the presidential a circuit but do the men make history do the individuals make history or its history simply a product of\nAll kinds of circumstances and put that question out there and I'll put it to

transformational leadership in management leadership and turn around leadership and visionary leadership in the order of the four presidents you might have something to add about leadership or ask about it\nPlease feel free to join the program our guest Doris Kearns Goodwin from Michael Krasny [noise]\n\nThis was coming up tomorrow on foreign journalist and author or a non here to dust will join us to talk about his new book winners take all the elite charade of changing the world in October and I joined me for a special lie foreign broadcast that the Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa\nWe'll be talking about ... county residents and local leaders about how they are coping one year after the devastating well first\nFor more information to join our live audience visit our website ... dot org slash for them\nDid they feel that elites were taking too much and somehow they would not being given it even though he may not be answering their needs he somehow made them feel he was on their side but I always find that when I find somebody like that just fascinating to ask them why why do you do this and you learn from that I think that's the important thing to break down the barrier\nAnd and just be able to think about and when you think about Lincoln again what he was doing in that second inaugural\nWas not trying to boast about having the union won the war he's saying the sin of slavery was shared by both sides both sides read the same Bible both prayed to the same God neither prayers were fully answered and then with malice toward none with charity for all lettuce bind up the nation's loans\nSo I Would just think about it as you're talking to a stranger you feel like that person's a stranger because of his political views but you need to try and understand where he is just as he has to understand where you are\nAnd I keep thinking sometimes what we need is a national service program [noise]\nSomething to really bring people from different sections and races and cities together in a common mission just like the war does without a war\nHere ... soon as I agree that having humility is good and we need to learn from mistakes but how can presidents in this hyper partisan atmosphere admit mistakes were show humility and not that this current president ever would any sign of weakness was pounced on an exaggerated by the other side\nYou know on the other hand look when John F. Kennedy and maybe it was an earlier time but when he went up and told the bay of pigs was a big mistake and he took responsibility for it his pulse went up he said look I I I Do bad and my pulse go up people want you to take responsibility they'll take a mistake as long as you learn from it\nAnd they'll show a few presidents and recent history who have done that\nYet somehow it's gotten into the bones of our presidents that you will look weak by many mistakes and it's just the opposite I think of it in our own terms if you admit a mistake to somebody you've had an argument with you're going to be much better off\n[noise] Charlie Rose from a big fan of slush and Syria and this keeps me optimistic the country changed that seems after the death of John Kennedy and many of my peer group I was born in the fifties or so have expressed similar sentiments do you think we would have had a different paths and other Kennedy lived and that this would have prevented the mistakes of LBJ\n[noise] I think it's possible that if Kennedy had lived he was more rational about the war in Vietnam he'd had more experience in more than Lyndon Johnson only being there for a short period of time\nAnd would have been less afraid to fail I'm On the other hand I don't think he would have gotten the great society and the civil rights and Medicare and Medicaid through I I think he needed they needed the Congress needed that incredible driving spirit\nOf Lyndon Johnson I mean there was an interesting article in the paper right before Kennedy was killed\nSaying that Congress was deadlocked in fact the whole future of the republic was at risk because nothing could get through the Congress 'cause it's southern Democrats\nControlled so many of the committee's only Johnson as a southerner could try some of those bills and he knew what those southern Democrats needed and wanted and get them to come out so we we won a lot through Johnson being there and domestic legislation and lost a lot on foreign policy\nDoors ... and her latest book is leadership in turbulent times in our next caller is Roger Roger you're on\nYour thank you Michael a script when I'd I'd like to listen carefully what I'm saying here because I think it's important to understand our society and I don't mean to oh any way old eater\nBut the American people simply or given talent and that's caused by only feeding on information orange coin start to their belief system right wing radio\nRight we do papers if you only listen that your tenure and we'll be foreign buyers and\nTrying to understand our society people or the sum total of what they read in here they don't just get a knowledge from say near\nThe [noise] it's so important that we have some way of communicating that can people can understand that a broad swath of our knowledge in this country not just one small form of the nation represent I think the best in radio\nBut there are other stations are only concerned with how many advertisers day out how much money they can generate they don't care what they do to the American psyche and that's the reason for Trump\nOr what the question is here Roger but let me guess doors groups would want to respond to your remarks she was listening very convincingly I might you\nKnow I I think there was no question about that the way we get our news these days is exacerbating the divisions between us a call is absolutely right we know from you know from studies that are made that people are listening either to one favorite cable station or another one favorite radio station or another where the news is slanted in each direction\nI mean it was different in the old days I mean when it was way back in the Eighteen fifty so it was like this\nWhen you want it to get the news you read your part is a newspaper so you only read the newspaper or the Democratic newspaper or the Republican newspaper and they would give totally different facts about what was going on so you weren't getting a sense of what was happening was only when the civil war came\nAnd he finally had reporters that you began to have national newspapers\nAnd then from the time of that you might national newspapers you had national radios you had three TV networks and at least there was a commonality of people listening to a similar objective facts on news once that split apart with the cable networks with social media with a tendency to go toward what you want\nThan we are living in silos and it gets much harder I mean there's got to be answers for it maybe we need more civic education in high schools and lower levels so the kids are having to learn various points of view [noise]\nMaybe we just need to bring these people together more um you know just cart them around the country my my son was involved in the ... the Harvard Institute of politics and they brought a series of Institute's from all over the country from kids together for four or five days\nFrom red states blue states can service and they really had an incredible experience just looking at each other as human beings and arguing with each other without seeming like I don't know who that person is because they're so distant there's answers to this but we have to do something to undo the silo sort of created in our country and it's created the foundation for Mr Trump without a question the caller's right\nNoticed silos really echo chambers I agree with you entirely I mean the only thing that could possibly bring peace to places like well the ongoing conflict in the middle east as we have Israelis and Palestinians actually meet each other a human level right and not enough of that in fact there's very little of it [noise] let me get another caller on James with us you joined us You're on the air\n... thanked me Michael I'm I don't want to kind of a venue in like a Democrat kind of continue to stick to\nSponsorship of the cage you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature banned political science and unfolds question will be held on Monday October Fifteen your mental a Dutch Shepherd ...\nRepublican started throwing it out you know you just [noise] the only thing I'm\nAn in Twenty years\nOr something at what point do you take the fight fire with fire or you can either in the system and hope that eventually the library and I'll take my answer off year\nOkay it's a political questions ... ...\nWell I think what Democrats have to do is there has to be passion and it has to be a narrative that they're presenting to the country you can't just be a series of bills all of which they might well believe in and of all of which might help lots of people in the country but\nIt has to come together to a narrative of where the country needs to go what's happened to the country that's one thing that Lincoln was so good at he\nWas always saying I Want to know where we've come from where we are now and we're we're going he always spoke in story form so that people said why do you tell so many stories and he said because stories with beginnings middles and people can remember better than facts and figures\nSo somehow I think the Republicans have been better able at that narrative member of the summer when the Tea Party took over and they created a narrative of death panels that would be on the health care bill that Obama was passing it was never true it was never going to happen but it became part of their narrative\nAnd so I think right now we need we need real passion coming from the Democratic party as to what's happening to our country under these last under these last admits under this last administration and where they want to take the country and why it's important for young people to to land on a country that they want to be\nUm a diverse country that immigration is good for the country and that having having more minimum wage though that people can sharing things is good for the country they have to make it a more personal and more more story telling and I wish they I think they need to do it for it pretty quickly\n'cause you know the body on her roses in terms of Democratic Party leadership who's in the national spotlight who was ...\nI don't know I mean I was in Texas the other day and so they were telling me that the challenger for Cruz is a great speaker or able to do that yeah\nSo I don't know I didn't get to hear him speak but you know there will be people there are people at mayors levels there are people that\nGovernors levels there we didn't know who are bomber was until shortly before that but my always my argument is we should be looking at them as leaders we should be evaluating not just how they speak not just what what they're promising not just how much money they've raised not how good they are in a debate\nThey've all been leaders somewhere we can look and see do they have humility do they have resilience do they have empathy can they connect with people can they control their negative emotions is their ambition for themselves or something else", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "03"}
