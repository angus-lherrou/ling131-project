author Doris Kearns Goodwin in her new book leadership and turbulent times\nThe presidential historian looks at the formative roots and influence of four presidents Abraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson and explore other stories could inspire better leadership in the face of today's challenges\nDoris Kearns Goodwin is the author of numerous books including the Pulitzer Prize winning no ordinary time Franklin Delano Roosevelt home front and World War two she were in the Lincoln price for a best seller team of rivals the basis for Steven Spielberg's Academy Award winning film Lincoln\nAnd she joins us in Studio for this for a while and good to have you back well thank you glad to be here the light it in fact in the foot so let me begin by saying you are grappling with some big questions here and that's an understatement uh\nIt's like a nature nurture our authors excuse me our our leaders born or made or do the times make the leaders leader makes a times these go back actually just for a personal note to your youth you run a pass pretty early\nI think what happened is when you're in graduate school those are the wonderful nights when you're thinking about these huge questions as you're reading Plato and Machiavellian Aristotle\nAnd you start asking where does ambition come from what's the proper form of government you know does the times make the man or the man make the times these are the kinds of things we'd sit around in rather ... has to be with drinking wine or beer at night but I've always been interested in and I think the main thing\nWas they would ask now how much beer\nLike exactly how much did your rank and what else did you do while you're drinking we're talking about these boring wonderful things\nBut I think what happened as well as I usually decide after I finished one person\nThat I have to move all his books out of my office one president to make room for the next and I would feel a little bit betraying that person who I'm leaving behind I feel guilty about moving from Franklin to Lincoln or from Lincoln to teddy untapped so this time I decided what if I keep my four guys together and and look at them in a different way through the lens of leadership\nAnd they all lead in turbulent times but I had no idea how relevant the title leadership in turbulent times would be when I started\nThat we'll get to that title in terms of our president a chief executive in time here because we want to hear your thoughts on that\nBut this was also um you got your quartet together here are these four presidents who as you say in your book you've spent many many hours with as a serious researcher day and night and go to bed with woke up with and so forth but also inspired by a student who asked you about leadership how can I be leaders\nAnd I've tried I've been generally going out and talking about leadership lessons from the White House depending on which book I had finished at the time\nAnd young students stood up and he said but wait how can I ever aspire to be one of those leaders there already on Mount Rushmore they're already on our currency it's too remote so I decided I Would start the book with each one of them running for office for the first time when they're twenty three twenty five there twenty eight\nAnd they're going to make mistakes they gonna fail they're going to screw up and a lot of ways they're going to be arrogant and have to soften that are against they're going to struggle just like we do so that a young person reading it could follow the trajectory of leadership and and see themselves along the way and see the choices they made and think about it in terms of the south I thought it may make them more relevant for them\nAnd instead of worrying about the hurricane that was in North Carolina he started mocking the idea of how many people had died in Puerto Rico and less people he said it died and they claim to die about throwing paper towels in Puerto Rico now it's it's a it's a quality that allows you to connect other people to see other people's points of view\nAnd in a big democracy as diverse as ours it's essential I mean I think along with humility what humility means is acknowledging Arabs and learning from your mistakes\nAnd there was a comment at one point he made that he would acknowledge mistakes if he ever made one but assuming that he might not make one\nThere's also a someone who said I can fix everything I mean there's just a sense of what you outlined his leadership qualities you're talking about people who want to eventually uh grow and mature in the way that they want to save others and work for the greater good and uh it just doesn't fit\nIn fashion is a direct opposite to that idea of I can fix anything and Teddy Roosevelt when he first got into the state legislature he\nToo like Trump like to be in the middle of things you know they always used to tease about him that he wanted to be the pride at the wedding the baby at the baptism and the corps at the funeral he he eats saver that central role that Trump does and he was a colorful figure like Trump he\nCould probably be a president in today's world he could definitely do treat Seattle those short saying speak softly and carry a big stick\nBut the difference is that he grew in office he grew out of that kind of self absorption when he was in the state legislature he would constantly be yelling\nAnd pounding his dad's firing against his opponents without him making headlines he became a very famous states that Senate state legislator right away but then he realized\nI'm getting nowhere I Alone can do this I Alone can fix that I Need these other people to cooperate so he he just softened his history on rhetoric and he made friends and he was able to get something done but that's how the growth in office has to take place\nI also have as you point out the ability to listen to other people and that's an important part of leadership as you defined it as well and not necessarily follow his negative impulses which is certainly a problem that our president chief executive has totally Teddy Roosevelt though because people are probably wondering\nA Lincoln civil war United union all that um they think of a LBJ as you said was civil rights and a will for that matter or other legislation that he was able to go through and they identify\nUm [noise] uh FDR was World War two and with the depression Teddy Roosevelt though I mean you talk about rising industry and you talk about the cold striking let's put this in perspective I mean these are extraordinary stories of people don't necessarily have that much with ... with\nYou know you know in some ways the industrial revolution at the turn of the twentieth century has the patterns that are most echoing for today\nUm you had the first time that you have a gap between the rich and the poor because suddenly these millionaires have arisen and for people are living in tenements there's a sense of conflict between people in the rural areas and the cities\nThere's a sense that the whole economy has been shaken up with all these new inventions the pace of life is going much too quick with telephones and telegraph and automobiles and as a sense of people wanting to feel life's life's not like it used to be so there was a populist moment at that time\nAnd and there was real real violence between the wage workers and the capitalist or lots of nationwide strikes\nUm they were bombings in the street and Teddy Roosevelt came in and what he did smartly was the arc argued for a square deal or a square deal meaning for the rich and the poor the capitalist and the wage worker so he took down some of the big companies that weren't following the rules of the game he smashed them\nUm he got railroads regulated he regulate some of the industry but he was able to keep his Republicans along with him because he mobilized public sentiment to say we have to deal with the worst aspects of the industrial water child labor ... minimum wage is um he really was able to contain\nHer child labor minimum wages um and he really was able to contain all that energy and it was in the industrial revolution fighting and came away a very effective president\nBut the whole strike was also really quite violent than he was able to bring people into the White House says go face to face and adjudicated so\nYeah the amazing thing was that President had no power at that time even intervene in a strike between labor and management because that's all private enterprise what is the government doing here so he had to pave the way to even invite the two sides to the White House\nAnd then they had a huge argument when they when the White House the cold barons wouldn't even look at them and minors and he said he had to grab the the ... the hands of his couch ... to prevent him from throwing out the window but he could contain that anger and then the great thing he did he hadn't notes taking up the whole meeting\nAnd that the coal Baron show themselves so badly that public sentiment they were saying terrible things even took teddy and saying to the minus I'm Talking to you you work with your hands they got published that night and sentiment that meant wildly in favor of the miners and that helped the cold parents to say well we better solve this we're not doing too well in public relations\nAnd containing anger about what Don McGahn or the president's private attorney said about the president compared on the king Kong in terms of uh\nAngers there's just kind of family tree disease for presidents to I mean you're talking about the square deal and of course we associate with the new deal but it just looking at their idols and their mentors and whom they looked up to the most to talk about the\nYeah I don't think I realized until the end but what was so interesting if you start\nA board with LBJ his political hero was FDR in fact he called him his political daddy it's wonderful the early meetings between the two because FDR saw something in this young bronco of LBJ in fact he said at one point if he said if I Franklin Roosevelt had not gone to Harvard this is the kind of unconventional politician I might have been\nAnd he predicted if the south ever had a president that might be LBJ and the two of them really got along well just from those early meetings and then FDR's hero with Teddy Roosevelt he had known teddy since he was young because they were distantly related and Eleanor of course was the niece of Teddy Roosevelt\nEleanor who you're called the secret weapon\nNo question I mean you know one of the things you want when you're building a team is to have people who are strong minded around you who can argue with you\nAnd she was his secret weapon she was what he calls his stillborn a thorn in his eyes always willing to argue with I'm always willing to question his assumption that she sent so many memos to general Marshall about discrimination in World War two that he had to assign a separate general has only task was to deal with Eleanor Roosevelt\nAnd then she had weekly press conferences only female reporters food comes from an entire generation of female journalists got their start because of Eleanor Roosevelt press conferences\nShe's amazing but back to the family tree I mean so so then Teddy Roosevelt is the hero for Franklin Roosevelt\nAnd then what Teddy Roosevelt zero is ... is is Abraham Lincoln in fact in the middle of\nUm of of a terrible time for that call strike he's reading the nine volumes of Abraham Lincoln's um biography by a nickel and hay and he's often thinking what would Lincoln do at this moment I'm between the radicals in the conservatives that I Need a Middle Way that's what Lincoln always dead and he would quote him he would talk about him\nAnd then Lincoln's hero was George Washington and the founding fathers our whole country is banned with his family tree and it was really fun to think about that shows what a short history our country has\nYet I think sometimes of George Washington father of our country as a kid growing up we learned never told the lie and we learn to Lincoln was honest Abe and every president now who were being reading about lying that has a\nA sort of done in an almanac records in world almanac records almost on a daily basis but let me do this let me invite you our listeners to join this conversation questions or comments about these four presidents or about leadership will get to that question about our leaders made are born I've asked I think every historian ... especially recently\nWe had the uh the lightning pleasure of having ... four and\nA and a ... a ... a search term going like on the matrix first shot and they try and make sure that I'm saying you have a we had to both on and are these things happen for the broadcasters from time to time\nA ... and I asked a question about you know history and the great men and especially unfortunately we're all great men uh up until\nI was so great man in the presidential a circus but do the men make history do the individuals make history has history simply a product of\nAll kinds of circumstances and put that question out there and I put it to Doris Kearns Goodwin\nWho I Know has a thoughtful answer and also put the

leadership and I should mention that each president is identified with a different type of leadership transformed more of a transformational leadership in management leadership and turn around leadership and visionary leadership in the order of the four presidents you might have something to add about leadership or ask about a\nFish will free to join the program our guest Doris Kearns Goodwin from Michael Krasny [noise]\n\nYou're hearing the rebroadcast of this morning's forums so we can't take your calls right now but the program we'll resume and the less than two minutes right now let's check in with Ted Anthony and see how traffic is this uh to to what is it Wednesday night [laughter]\nAren't in a good evening to you will head to the Altamont Pass first reports of an accident eastbound five eighty right near grant line but we are seeing a little bit of slow traffic here no other details on his accidents each be\nMaking the drive towards the scene airfield accident the vehicle hit centered or a centered abide but it's the ... block east baton eighty right near north Texas street and for the ...\n... get the guard rail but that cars onto the shoulder north bound to forty two right at ... fortunately center's not picking up any delays scented Anthony for Kiki weedy thank you Ted his report was brought to us by compassion international\nWomen are toxic calm because being angry you mean they will sound childlike emotional and hands\nDid they feel did they come from rural areas and they felt cities were places of sand as a as they did at the turn of the twenty century\nDid they feel that elites were taking too much and somehow they were not being given it even though he may not be answering their needs you somehow made them feel he was on their side but I always find that when I find somebody like that just fascinating to ask them why why do you do this and you learn from that I think that's the important thing to break down the barrier\nAnd and just be able to think about it when you think about Lincoln again what he was doing in that second inaugural was\nNot trying to boast about having the union won the war he's saying the sin of slavery was shared by both sides both sides read the same Bible both prey to the same God neither prayers were fully answered and then with malice toward none with charity for all lettuce bind up the nation's loans\nSo I Would just think about it as you're talking to a stranger you feel like that person's a stranger because of his political views but you need to try and understand where he is just as he has to understand where you are\nAnd I keep thinking sometimes what we need is a national service program [noise]\nSomething to really bring people from different sections and races and cities together in a common mission just like the war does without a war\nHere ... says I agreed to having humility is good and we need to learn from mistakes but how can presidents in this hyper partisan atmosphere admit mistakes were show humility and not that this current president ever would any sign of weakness was pounced on an exaggerated by the other side\nYou know on the other hand look when John F. Kennedy and maybe it was an earlier time but when he went up and told the bay of pigs was a big mistake and they took responsibility\nHe went up and told the bay of pigs was a big mistake and he took responsibility for it his pulse went up he said look I I I Do bad and my pulse go up people want you to take responsibility they'll take a mistake as long as you learn from it and that was so few\nPresidents in recent history who have done that\nYet somehow it's gotten into the bones of our presidents that you will look weak by many mistakes and it's just the opposite I think of it in our own terms if you admit a mistake to somebody you've had an argument with you're going to be much better off\n[noise] Charlie writes I'm a big fan of slush from Syria and this keeps me optimistic to country changed it seems after the death of John Kennedy and many of my peer group I was born in the fifties or so have expressed similar sentiments do you think we would have had a different paths and other Kennedy lived and that this would have prevented the mistakes of LBJ\n[noise] I think it's possible that if Kennedy had lived he was more rational about the war in Vietnam you had more experience in more than Lyndon Johnson only being there for a short period of time\nAnd would have been less afraid to fail I'm On the other hand I don't think he would have gotten the great society and the civil rights and Medicare and Medicaid through I I think he needed they needed the Congress needed that incredible driving spirit\nLyndon Johnson I mean it was an interesting article in the paper right before Kennedy was killed saying that Congress was deadlocked in fact the whole future of the republic was at risk because nothing to get through the Congress because the southern Democrats\nControlled so many of the committee's only Johnston as a southerner could try some of those bills and he knew what those southern Democrats needed and wanted and get them to come out so we we won a lot through Johnson being there and domestic legislation and lost a lot of foreign policy\nStores ... is our guest and her latest book is leadership in turbulent times in our next caller is Roger Roger you're on\nThank you Michael a script and I'd I'd like to listen carefully what I'm saying here because I think it's important to understand our society and I don't mean or does it any way old eater\nBut the American people simply lack of a coward and that's caused by only feeding on information orange that coin start to their belief system right wing radio\nRight we do favors if you only listen to that your opinion will be foreign buyers and\nTrying to understand our society people or the sum total of what they read in here they don't just get a knowledge from Faye near\nThe [noise] it's so important that we have some way of communicating that can people can understand that a broad swath of our knowledge in this country not just one small form of\n... station represent I think the best in radio but there are other stations are only concerned with how many advertisers day have how much money they can generate they don't care what they do to the American psyche and that's the reason for Trump\nOr what the question is here Roger but let me guess Doris Kearns Goodwin respond to your remarks he was listening very [laughter] 'cause then suddenly I might you\nKnow I I think there was no question but that the way we get our news these days is exacerbating the divisions between us a call is absolutely right we know from you know from studies that are made that people are listening either to one favorite cable station or another one favorite radio station or another where the news is slanted in each direction\nI mean it was different in the old days I mean when it was way back in the Eighteen fifties it was like this when you want it to get the news you read your part is a newspaper so you only read the newspaper or the Democratic newspaper or the Republican newspaper\nAnd they would give totally different facts about what was going on so you weren't getting a sense of what was happening was only when the civil war came\nAnd he finally had reporters that you began to have national newspapers\nAnd then from the time of that you might national newspapers you had national radios you had three TV networks and at least there was a commonality of people listening to a similar objective facts on news once that split apart with the cable networks with social media with the tendency to go toward what you want\nThan we are living in silos and it gets much harder I mean there's got to be answers for it maybe we need more civic education in high schools and lower levels so the kids are having to learn various points of view [noise]\nMaybe we just need to bring these people together more um you know just cart them around the country my my son was involved in the Harvey Harvard Institute of politics and they brought a series of Institute's from all over the country from kids together for four or five days\nFrom red states blue states can service and they really had an incredible experience just looking at each other as human beings and arguing with each other without seeming like I don't know who that person is because they're so distant there's answers to this but we have to do something to to undo the silo so they've created in our country and it's created the foundation for Mr Trump without a question the caller's right\nNow he's silos really echo chambers I agree with you entirely I mean the only thing that could possibly bring peace to places like well the ongoing conflict in the middle east is to have Israelis and Palestinians actually meet each other on human level right and not enough of that in fact there's very little of it [noise] let me get another caller on dreams that you join us you're on the air\nI thanked me Michael I'm I don't want to kind of general opinion of like\nA Democrat is kind of continue to stick to policy and process and I'm a continuing like decorum and build interest conch trying to trust in the system that it's going to work the way it's supposed to\nEnd it feels like Republicans are kind of throwing it out and you know you're just doing whatever works no matter the cost Asher thing\nUm and in what Twenty years Democrats out in the tea or something so at what point do you kind of take the globe\nOr something at one point out of the globe fight fire with fire or you can either in the system and hope that eventually the library and I'll take my answer off year\nOkay it's a political questions first groups would\nWell I think what Democrats have to do is there has to be passion and it has to be a narrative that they're presenting to the country\nYou can't just be a series of bills all of which they might well believe in in of all of which might help lots of people in the country\nBut it has to come together to a narrative of where the country needs to go what's happened to the country that's one thing that Lincoln was so good at he\nWas always saying I Want to know where we've come from where we are now and we're we're going he always spoke in story form so that people said why do you tell so many stories and he said because stories with beginnings middles and people can remember better than facts and figures\nSo somehow I think the Republicans have been better able at that narrative I mean remember this summer when the Tea Party took over and they created a narrative of death panels that would be on the health care bill that Obama was passing it was never true it was never going to happen but it became part of their narrative\nAnd so I think right now we need we need real passion coming from the Democratic party as to what's happening to our country under these last under these last admits under this last administration and where they want to take the country and why it's important for young people to to land on a country that they want to be\nUm a diverse country that immigration is good for the country\nAnd that having having more minimum wage though that people can share and things is good for the country they have to make it\nA more personal and more more story telling\nAnd I wish they I think they need to do it for it pretty quickly\n'cause everybody on the horizon in terms of Democratic Party leadership who's in the\nNational spotlight who was ... I don't know I mean I was in Texas the other day and so they were telling me that the challenger for Cruz is a great speaker or neighbors who do that yeah\nSo I I don't know I didn't get to hear him speak but you know there will be people there are people at mayors levels there are people that\nGovernors levels there we didn't know who are bomber was until shortly before that but my always my argument as we should be looking at them as leaders we should be evaluating not just how they speak not just what what they're promising not just how much money they've raised not how good they are in a debate\nThey've all been leaders somewhere we can look and see do they have humility do they have resilience do they have empathy can they connect with people can they control their negative emotions is their ambition for themselves or something else\nHow do they deal with ordinary people how do they build a team or they gave able to have a team with strong people could argue with him all of those things are known before Tim Russert died he and I talked about the fact\nCan be bad report brought to you by lucky stores in support for cake weedy comes from San Francisco State University

October sixteen more about this summer that NPR dot org slash summer and by the listeners of cake you read e\nWe're expecting isolated showers to linger through late this morning before dry conditions returned to the bay area late in the day a further drying was a slight warming grand new forecast through the weekend respecting eyes today they range from the low sixties\nAlong the coast to the mid seventies inland and we'll have western early afternoon wins from ten to twenty miles per hour [noise]\n\nLook into this morning's forum on Michael Krasny members of the Senate are assessing the supplemental lift the background sound for Brett Kavanaugh which could determine whether key senators support the Supreme Court nominee\nSenior White house officials said the report shows no corroboration of allegations against Kavanaugh enter confident that the pastor confirmation has been eased Kevin those kind of a nation depends on Republican senators voting strictly along party lines with three Republican senators have you have to say how they will vote\nWe're going to get the latest on the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual assault made against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd we're joined first by Derek Wall back who is politics editor for Bloomberg welcome there are good to have you with us thank you so much\nWell let's begin by just updating what we know at this point the senators are in a parent's seclusion looking over this FBI report and one\nOf these you talk about their report with you but the fact of the matter is that a Senator Mitch McConnell are is trying to push this through he's even use language has suggested he wants to get a vote by Saturday what's the likelihood of that\nWell it's a pretty high actually the Senate is going to take a procedural vote tomorrow at some point that will give us a test of where senators happened to be standing right now if\nThat that vote me it's a little more than a you know than half of of the fact that it can have exactly half\nUm [noise] but once that hurdle is cleared then you get to thirty hours of debate at most and then they vote so vote really could happen on Kavanaugh's sometime Saturday\nSo we really have a those three senators who have expressed concern I'm Talking about Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and uh\nBut uh no I'm Sorry I'm [laughter] we're talking about actually three senators Jeff Flake of Arizona as well but I'm Susan Collins of Maine they they've all expressed concern about what it says the report is going to reveal but aren't we already getting comments from at least ... and a men's lake\nShore are yes ah when we have heard from Jeff like we've heard from Susan Collins both of them have said\nThat appears to be a relief thorough investigation which is you know one of the criticisms that Democrats have is that it wasn't thorough [noise] ah but they said that it appears to be thorough flake said that there's no additional corroborating formation that came up at the FBI's additional background check on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd ... comments because this entire\nProcess was sort of set out to buy some more time to talk to some more people and to see what comes up and if nothing new has come up as a Republican suggests\nThat it could give coverage to those folks just that you know what we've done our job and let's go Democrats are trying to make it an issue right now that not every one day thing should has been talk Jew won't talk to but again\nRepublicans control the majority it entirely within Republican hands whether or not this goes through they don't need a single democratic vote and if they've done enough to make Jeff Flake happy and make Susan Collins happy getting married fifty votes\nAnd it appears that they're getting in line at least some of the comments that have been made here but we're getting a lot of pushback obviously from the Democrats Senator Feinstein said that uh they should have been an interview and not only on the the people who were interviewed many who have come forward and so they want to be interviewed by the FBI there was a list originally but\nUm and then there's also been you know there were some very very detailed fact checks of\nKavanaugh's testimony and talking about his own behavior in high school and college and it is it is difficult to set aside the assault allegations in this but\nWere you to set them aside and you look at the types of things that he said about things that he did that there is dishonesty that\nWell your college roommate who came forward it up for you to not query him but who should Pacific Lee the the brick oven a lie under oath of others drinking habits\nAnd more than one person has said that in in the media and in other places now we don't a hundred percent know who the FBI spoke with we believe that the FBI did not speak to that person and we know that um people that did speaks the FBI gave\nNames of other people the FBI should talk with and that those people were not contacted but we haven't seen the report yeah you know as you're you're very detailed a deep race at the top of the show go into we don't know exactly what's in it we don't know what senators are going to learn but\nBut it all leads to the politics of this are pointing toward confirmation and I think Republicans believe that that is a good thing for them\nIt was a comment from a listener named Scott who writes the investigation was nothing but a whitewashed to a low ... Murkowski cover to vote for ... another slap in the face to all Americans was a GOP\nOn the other hand ... says it will be a great opportunity for the GOP to show was a care at all about women and women will notice and Mike Rhodes nobody as Clarence Thomas Ruth Bader Ginsburg or at the Kennedy about how the party in high school let me go to our calls and let's begin to be with you good morning you're on the air\nWarning question is why didn't cabinet or have a lie detector test\nWas offered to him who suitable and Sony oh you want to comment on the\n... yeah he was asked several times when he'd be willing to take one um but the bottom line is that the FBI didn't talk with him he was not one of the people that were added to this this investigation which Republicans like to point out is the seventh FBI background check\nOn what we have heard is that they said that they believe that bloody Ford's testimony on Thursday was extensive enough that they didn't need to speak to her but then there were requests for her psychiatric\nRecords that she had reference during her testimony and she said she would be willing to provide those and then the FBI never actually asked for them so there was a lot of back and forth on this and um you know you're\nProbably rather not permissible in in court anyone in this was not a prosecution this was not a criminal trial or even related to a criminal throws a job interview\nAnd there is also that let me get another caller border and we go to Nevada and Jim you're on the air good morning\nIt's MORNING and thank you I Love this conversation 'cause ah\nStrategically it's so interesting to me I mean yeah they've got their base all riled up but what if I mean what if they cabin I had been postponed or became a you know a non nominee that would've really secured them for the midterms by giving debates what they what are they\nGoing to have to deal with the fallout and are now the midterms even more secure for the blue it [noise]\nAnd you say ...\n... you know as I mentioned California start devoting a lot of people out here are really upset about the situation I think that has energized Democrats you had the generic ballot favors Democrats at this point for the house but the Senate races that were kind of on the margins are now seeming more solidified for Republicans this year Republican senators that word\nI'm looking at as vulnerable you know you've got in Nevada Dean Heller is you didn't all in all likelihood is going to be voting to confirm Kavanaugh and\nHe's made a judgment call that that is the right thing for him to do for his reelection and then you have these Democratic senators and so called Trump states states that voted for Trump by large margins and twenty six team you know Joe Manchin\nIs he going to vote for cabin I I'm not sure yet but if he does and he's making a judgment call that that's going to help him and his reelection bed or as he faces you know a very very tough\nSponsorship of the cage you read the live stream by deference master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature bent political science and infection will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Shepherd ... nation Germany and\nChat information on that yeah and and Kavanaugh's nomination remains popular in her state you know in ... one of the earlier callers brought the IDF cover right well there's cover for Democrats too because\nNow they can feel free to vote no to be able to complain about the process you know saying that the investigation when Thoreau enough that it was you know all of a shame because the White House controlled\nThe parameters of that investigation or that they are only given you know an hour to review it and there's only one copy it is not going to be released the public whatever those are Democrats\nHave inability to remain United in ... now and again\nThat won't matter because of the math and the fact that he he can and less a Republican senator is saying no here\nThat if he is going to become confirmed\nLet me read some more comments that are coming in from listeners when rights which was a clear case of White House administrative out of control abuse of power time for any GOP who care about justice to vote no and Roberta shows\nThe FBI background check is a shame the widows limited who could be interviewed the Senate will limit what can be reported to whom within a limited time and limited scope what are you seeing Christian in a way of protest at this point what are we uh actually observing on that score\n[noise] gosh I mean\nThere there's so many people in Washington right now\nWho are pretty unhappy about what's happening here they're tracking from all across the country they're melting down phone lines I mean if you call anyone right now you're hearing\n'em at length you know please hold we know we have long wait times are sometimes you're busy signals or the voice mails or fall and you know that if you're getting in touch with any buddy who works on Capitol Hill right now like give them some sympathy because they're being just completely bombarded by people on both sides uh with strong and passionate\nFeelings on this issue and you know the reality is that senators more than likely know how they're going about before they look at that report and the process is starting to hold this vote you know over the weekend and\nThat's that's going forward and and I think some cases I talked to some people who oppose Kavanaugh who believed that what happened on friday with the women confronting Senator Flake and the elevator you know had some and change something and giving them hope that\nPeople can make a difference right that you can convince your senator and yeah and the next couple of days may um proved that that is less likely\nThat we'll get another caller border John joined us You're on\nA they're a ... or ... years and I'm Wondering if a Democrat either report on during the obligation or to keep a confidential or whether they can disclose it and uh it's so there are any use of putting pressure on why\n... ... ... the issue of what public and what's not have been really key over the last several weeks and months here as we know I'm ... Ford initially came forward to her congresswoman Anna Eshoo from the bay area\nWho then passed assigned to Senator Feinstein somebody took that to the press and Senator Feinstein says it wasn't her and it wasn't her staff and she ended up not telling her fellow a Senate Judiciary Democrats so that's one issue right there right\nUm this report is being kept in a room it's like for reviewing confidential documents frequently used and issues of matters of national security in a place in the capital where reporters stake out the outside to stand there with our microphones and cameras and they're going to ask what was in that report so\nMy prediction is that we'll have a general sense of you know is that in\nTwelve page report is that is thirty nine page report is it a seven hundred and thirty nine page report by the time senator start coming out of that room and we might have a sense of the broad general descriptions are the broad findings but if we see it\nIt will have been one of one hundred senators who leaked it and that's a difficult position for them to be and once you involved staff and um other people or the I'm sure the White House has a copy that's not impossible that it could get leave from their at least the description of the contents could at least but I'm so that that's a long way of saying\nIt is entirely possible that democratic senator could try to do some sort of procedural maneuver to make this a public document but because Republicans have the control here that is unlikely to happen if they don't want it to be ...\nIt's also fair to say Christian of the the temperament of we're coming up on the under the segment unfortunately but the temperament and for that matter partisanship which came up uh in the hearings or for that matter lying under oath will not be part of this whole picture [noise]\nIt doesn't seem like it I think you're going to hear a lot about it on the Senate floor uh people are going to pretty rail against the nomination those who are opposed to it and that's going to be some of their data points that they mention\nPolice have you with us grateful for your time thank you present a villain Tony half a day to journalism professor a media center director of us sees Annenberg when we come back we're going to talk about\nA very shocking report to the came out about substandard care front of the California immigration facility and we're going to have to do on a decision very important decision was made yesterday on immigration state to solve it [noise]\n[noise]\nWas just coming up in our second hour of four on this morning journalist and author unarmed gear there the U.S will join us to talk about his new book winners take all religious ready to changing the world than other children I joined me for a special live foreign broadcast of the Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa\nWe'll be talking with ... county residents and local leaders about how they are coping one year after the devastating wildfires\nHow they are coping one year after the devastating wildfires\nFor more information to join her live audience visit our website ... dot org slash for [noise]\nAnd there should be people held accountable for what\nWe're talking about substandard care if I wanted to California immigration facility also talking about the decision that was a just rendered by judge enrich and it has to do with deportation are being held up now actually as I said earlier a blow against the Trump Administration was trying to get\nPeople who have temporary protected status or deported a from those four countries that free dimensional Salvador Haiti Nicaraguan Sudan\nI Do welcome your phone calls on this and you may want to come in and either read these stories and we want to hear from you so let me give you the phone number to call its toll free it's eight six six seven three three six seven eight six here your reactions who your sons who are the questions you might have and you can join us now\nAgain at eight six six seven three three six seven eight six or you can email us for them to eat out or go to our website ... dot org slash forum and click on the segment and\nPost your questions or comments there or tweet us our Twitter handle is at ...

January they sat they should have a correction in one place we'll see if that happens\nSee and also let me go back to you how they are and how does this could there's been a lot of an action from your description in from the report but there's\nSponsorship of dictate you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nAnd the beginning for the shutdown of the country center I'm like I said one year after it opened that was the first that and what we have seen is that these that have occurred um for a medical medical care and so we we um\nWe'd hoped that conditions will change but ultimately we were one for the center of senator close on because they have proven that um they're not adequate to really take care of detainees and an awful ice it's proven that they don't have the capacity to oversee the detention center\nReaders let's talk about who's in the detention center I mean you've got a ... month point or nearly a couple of thousand people these are mainly asylum seekers and those were recording caught an immigration sweeps and actually people who were arrested as well yeah well\nThat's right I mean that's very important to remember\nOn this is one of the largest facilities saying in California or the largest I've heard\nUm but it's it's got for adults at detainees and it has the capacity to hold up to one thousand nine hundred and forty people almost two thousand people and most of these people are like you said are asylum seekers are people who are fighting deportations of people who have a case in immigration court\nAnd they're detained while their case in decided this is something that the Trump Administration and ... has been doing more is denying people their ability to you know leave at the detention center and the waiting for the kids to be decided outside\nThey're keeping more people in detention centers and so ah yeah that's very important that most of these people have not commit committed a serious crime or anything it should not be in theory\nA punitive conditions but this report definitely makes a team at looks like it's it's very difficult to be in there and that's one thing I've heard\nNonstop is that the conditions at immigrant detention centers are very difficult\nVery hard she started to cross the border all the rationales lord yes and so these what I've heard is that the conditions in Adelanto are not unique that they're more than the tension centers that has a similar conditions or some of the issues\nUm that that we've been discussing and so uh yeah that's a that's that's a serious situation if you happen to be detained at one of these places\nAnd what about those two news and the new ... doesn't want to let me go back to how this on the the implication here there's a lot of these people are definitely on the verge of suicide are contemplating it are wanting to thinking that they\n[laughter] yeah so ... there's been many reports of multiple suicide of parents who kind of on the line through the last ... a person that committed to her was of modern or twenty Seventeen and um but um he actually uh\nUh you know he hung himself\nAnd so for us to see that um you know that our eyes NGO notes that people are serious considering their life and I'm not taking down the news and or off of giving and medical attention or or mental health support it's really concerning that um it it sure seems like they're encouraging that behavior encouraging them to\nTo you know to commit suicide rather than actually providing services and um another thing that these are issues that are that are happening instead of on the line though another issue that people have tried you know that for two story build a building and filling side we heard that people have\nYou know don't and felt from the from the second floor but you know I'm In and trying to\nCommit suicide they have hurt themselves in ... another issue that we have is that when the um things do happen or most time they will quote a whole a place every one in uh in um uh they will shut down the detention center and so people can make phone calls\nA until we find out two or three days later that this happened and everyone was on lockdown or because they don't go to jail and I didn't want that needs to break\nAnd they didn't want people to find out um what was happening in the detention center\nWe should mention these new shoes were made out of bed sheets are in the cells and uh we're talking about you know extraordinary kind of a rigid circumstances that have come to light was his department of homeland security report if you want to comment or if you want to find out more of them are girls severe Hernandez director of the inland coalition for immigrant rights for\nA ... Romero please feel free to join the program again the toll free number for you to join his eight six six seven three three six seven eight six or email us for them to do that or brutal\nYes no I just wanted to mention in the course of a you know our reporting this story I reached out to the attorney general's office in California because like you said they have this new authority since\nLast year I was twenty Seventeen law by senator state center with a lot\nOf that and you know gives them the power to go into this these facilities and review them which we didn't I didn't have before\nSo it was a response between journalism and they\nDid not want to comment on anything about their investigation and not even how many centers they visit it yet you know what they're doing about it uh\nWhat's the scope of via address already because it's not I mean by law they're supposed to release this report a type ... you know march twenty Nineteen but like you know that the guest said it's it's a very long time and these are earning matters that even the department of homeland security\nIs telling eyes that you know need attention immediately\nSo um we don't know exactly what at the uh\nUm attorney general's office is doing but a senator and we've got about ... said that he's expecting and he he\nHe he knows that this was a very important issue for them and that they are working on it\nThere's another side of this\nHe he knows that this is a very important issue for them and that they are working on it\nThere's another side of this that really needs to be mentioned for the public and that is that the ... review\nAlso got into third parties who are working for geo which\nWas a sort of the company has operating in running this operation and not only were all these services substandard and medical care not being administered but you had for example physicians were signing off on a\nPatients without seeing them I mean there's it sounds like there's real fraud going on as well\nWell I mean what we know from their report is that there is some guidelines right that they're supposed to be following and these are ISIS as stand races guidelines right and they're not following though so for example they mentioned people and basically asked solitary confinement which they called disciplinary segregation or something like that\nI'm at that people they're they're supposed to be checked on um you know frequently and you I mean real tax you know like at least touch a person and more and what they saw was that doctors were just asking like are you OK in English\nYou know and and of course some of these people are not English proficient and they said something else about the ... they found and this is I think it's I Am not\nExactly sure if it was just one day a visit I Know that they visited and they looked at records of the facility that the inspectors\nBut they said that there was a blind man with limited English and in one of these you know side taken assignments situations and none of the people they've found and and as a disciplinary segregation that was a valid reason for them to be there so um it it definitely suggest that uh they\nSuggested you know put someone in because you feel it's crucial to do so I mean without any reason there's no due process\nWell there there might be that perception from guard that from guards that there is some violation of the rules but that wasn't a procedure that's supposed to be followed\nUs with America priests let me get a caller on here and let me get our first caller is Greg good morning\nThe morning as well why aren't um consulates from each of those countries really making sure that they're taking care of all really I Would think that if they're us citizens in another country and climbed up conflict would be looking out for their their best you know I'm sure\nIt's a good source of question have you ever known as you hearing from an ...\nYeah so I Can't speak for the consulate themselves very well um we go to the Mexican consular here in uh in summer they know they do that for another lump though are what we found is that even um when the um when detainees bring up the issue to the conflict in the conflict brings them up to our um they're usually say um\nThanks Joe his report brought to you by Pacific catch west coast ... shells and support for cake weedy comes from Port in that the Internet have things in the cloud increase business capabilities but they also increased risk of exposure to security breaches\nFordham at security fabric works to mitigate that risk more at Fort the net dot com slash fabric this is ...

white supremacy in a way in a mainstream way that we're not talking about it five years ago we are talking about male supremacy\nIn a way that we we're not talking about it five years ago and part of what I'm trying to suggest here is the third supremacy in American Life that we don't talk about enough which is capitals supremacy\nWe talk about inequality and these things the part of what this is getting at is we are living in an economy now and this is a global phenomenon to some extent but it's really acutely true here we're we have a sexually built an economy in which\nCapitalists Supreme and if you own capital and hold capital born into capital as we learn to Donald Trump expos they yesterday than you are going to get ahead in life\nAnd if you work for a living as perhaps many of your listeners do then unfortunately things are not going to be as easy for you and we have to think about whether that's the kind of society we want and we used to think about whether we\nAre going to think about changing that in the old San Francisco way which is movements and organizing and changing\nPolitics and policy just an allele is now correct yeah or whether we want to solve that in the new San Francisco way which is creating a nap\n[laughter] the author of winners\nTake all with us in Studio the elite charade of changing the world and we're going to invite you our listeners to join this conversation it is a far reaching conversation but we do want to hear from you and uh\nYou can join us now at our toll free number let me give you that number eight six six seven three three six seven eight six please feel free to joined the program you can also join us by emailing us forum at ... dot org or go to our website ... dot org slash forum and click on the segment or tweet us ...\nKick you eat out or slash forum and click on the segment or tweet us our Twitter handle is at ... am\nKennan apps market movement or outsmart them which movement has it sparked so far\n[laughter] [noise] well you know here we get into a lot of your criticism and I've said similar things critically about\nUm in fact it's fascinating to read\nWhat you say about Facebook that calls itself the community will call itself a company which I think is very regulatory in many ways but the reality is that Facebook is connected people and they make that argument they come by you know we're connecting people all over the world but at the same time it's been weaponized the really the toxic a\nTerrible damage in the last election has help white supremacists and so forth I mean I mean all these in other words negative things that have come about\nNegatives would be but when you think about Facebook ... when he listens to think about the only thing I think there is a case to be made that Facebook is the most idealistic major company in American history right I think there's I Can't think of any other company that has all of that size and scale that has so\nAssertively declared itself to be\nA community dedicated to the man's a patient of mankind\nAnd I think it has no accident that perhaps the most idealistic company in American history is also the first company in American history to compromise a sacred federal election\nIn other words the idealism creates blindness it creates arrogance it creates a refusal to look within\nAnd the reality is General Electric never compromise an American election bank of America never compromise an American\nElection they also never cause death in Myanmar and India but the real relatives who is to the fact that there was always a downside with innovation you read about innovation a lot you bring up the fact that innovation has brought mainly rewards to those who are the wealthiest and most affluent siphons itself up words\nI mean this word innovation is everywhere I mean I I hear from teachers\nWho are trying to just teach their kids which is a pretty traditional thing you do when you actually\nDoesn't need to change that much every year to actually teach kids how to write and think and do science and these teachers are bludgeoned by this outside pressure like innovation we've gotta teach innovation without these innovation and you know the problem with this innovation cult innovation just means new stuff\nOkay that's Latin or whatever it is for new stuff and here's the problem we have made a cult of innovation\nAnd we've forgotten a word that actually matters more which is progress\nProgress is when most people's lives get better because of said new thing but we have over the last thirty forty years in America is a remarkable ... junction\nBetween innovation and progress does anybody listening to this feel like we haven't had enough new stuff\nIn America lost thirty forty years I think we're all tired of new stuff that's been too much new stuff\nYou also make a very important but it hasn't made most people's lives better make sure the machine in American Life that converts innovation new stuff\nInto progress betterment for most people that machine is broken and and what I'm arguing is the repair of that machine is our most urgent national priority and that the people who helped whoever vested interest\nIn not smoothing out\nInnovation and the progress for all who actually have a vested interest in hoarding progress for themselves those people aren't going to be the ones to save us you know I I was\nGonna say I found a strike you know you make a distinction between um generosity on the one hand injustice on the other and I think that's an important dichotomy because people can be very generous but not necessarily worked or justice but when you say repair the machine or for that matter dismantled machine I don't know what are you what are you suggesting specifically\nYou know that that may sound very dramatic and and idealistic as you said\nIt is but you know I often remind people I'm\nA lot of what I'm Talking about at a practical level is simply bringing us into line but the rest of the rich world\nRight we are you know when you look at those lists of like which countries do this versus don't and you know it's always like Saudi Arabia is always like the one on you know various human rights and things like we are that for the rich world and we don't realize that we're our social mobility is at the bottom in terms of the rich world\nUm our taxes and many cases on wealthy people are much lower than I was from the rich world our minimum wages are lower than much of the rich world are we obviously deprive health care to people many ways we become a third world country I think we've we've become two countries the the part of America that is high functioning is\nNot just first world but the the richest and most successful of the first world countries no question um I you know you're better off being in the top\nCans of America and you are being in the top ten says I think any other country in the world um if you're in the bottom half of your society are much better off being in any other rich country about America perhaps and so a lot of things I'm Talking about not rocket science we probably need to tax inheritance is more and have marginal tax rates on rich people go up to where they were\nYou know thirty forty fifty years ago we probably need to fund public schools equally we probably need to make sure that you get health care whether you work twenty nine hours of target or thirty hours a target and not have your health care kick in only if you happen to work\nThirties we probably need to make sure that uh people are not a women are not faced with decisions about do I work or not based on the fact that we don't give any kind of support with with childcare these are things that are choices that we can make and that most of the rich world makes and it's not that complicated about a break\nBut we're gonna continue is on or if you were there the U.S and you can join us a toll free number eight\nSix six seven three three six Seventy six or email us ... or ... or tweet us our Twitter handles has cake you easy for them this is from Michael Krasny [noise]\n\nThis was coming up tomorrow on foreign creator or the humorous media outlet the onion Scott decrease joins us to talk about his new book which is a parody of Ilan most welcome to the future which is mine and then that's overnight joined me for a special live foreign broadcast at the Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa\nWe'll be talking with ... county residents and local leaders about how they're coping one year after the devastating wildfires\nFor more information and to join her live audience visit our website ... dot org slash for um [noise]\nYou know when they want to on things that they want to do no one had been buddies that today more than them so I spent time in ... and how did you get from here to there and he used to have this thing and the final or his final speech to the final CGI which is this is all that works\nIn the modern world this is all that work this kind of political ... corporate poses the credit pragmatism and I yeah I ... that took the wind out of me I thought a man who's run the most powerful machinery of state in the history of human civilization is out there telling young people the only way to make change in the modern world is by\nPartnering with companies and foundation\nEvery president has said this though I mean even Obama who is looked at as a real serious potential for agents of change you would have to make compromises have to work within the system I don't have the power that people said I'm not talking about compromising\nHere I'm Talking about changing the locus of change that we ... our ... our culture has been on the receiving end of a Pluto chronic advertising campaign that has tried to convince us\nWe can't make a change in the old ways through movements and policy and law that the only change worth making our wind wind changes that put companies and foundations and rich people in the ...\nPut companies and foundations and rich people in the co pilot's seat and the problem is when rich people are your co pilot and making change they gain a veto over all types of change that would be threatening to rich people to hear from more of our listeners let's go next to you Rob joined us You're on the air\nThank you um I grew up in the seventies and we studied all it was a kid you know in public school San Francisco and we studied the social injustices that happening in the the nineteenth century and and what happens with the environment and we really thought that by talking about this and learning about it\nWe would have a better society by now\nAnd it just seems like we're starting to make a lot of the same mistakes and and running down the wages of people the unions are getting less powerful and have\nThe people that are are like the um gym is that Mr stiers ah for every one of those that's out there there's also a cop brothers\nYou know and they're trying to drive down the idea that government can help they want to make people think the government is part of the deep state and then we have to eliminate all the environmental laws older the labor laws that were\nA weird and acted to try to make this a better world and I'm not a communist I'm not a socialist capitalist myself but it think that capitalism has gone through this whole new level\nAnd that idea that you're a guest said that we have enough we don't need to be consuming more stuff we need to make the planet better\nAnd the way we're going about it I just feel like our hands are tied and it's depressing\nRob I appreciate your framing it that way and giving us your feelings are kind of depressing as what you hear a lot of people say humans\nCan I can let me address the depression and provide hope and which is when I hear Rob ... it's such a valid question he's raised me and I think\nWe are actually if you if you leave Trump aside for a second but in in in many ways because it from we are actually having a conversation in America about capitalism\nThat we haven't had an a long time a real conversation we have people running on all sides of the spectrum we have democratic socialist we have\nPeople who are not democratic socialist running a very progressive platforms but we also had an Donald Trump a Republican who ran against Wall Street\nAnd the global financial elite not caring about communities which I hate when they did with it but in some of that diagnosis he actually was naming something accurate and so I think this is a very right moment in America to be talking and thinking about capitalism and the point I Would make is in America we often talk about capitalism has some big monolithic thing\nYou either have it or you don't write capitalism is not binary\nPen capitalism comes in a lot of flavors perhaps even more than Baskin Robbins\nAnd you have Chinese capitalism which is combined with an authoritarian government in a Communist Party that still in power but is really capitalism and a bunch of ways but also restricts free trade and very creative ways where they require foreign companies have local partners which meant that they got the entire\nCorporate infrastructure of the world to mentor a generation of Chinese executives and CEOs very smart\nNo so really wasn't told much will property which gun short Trump has made a miniature\nI'm Talking about variety and diversity right you have in Europe in Germany you have capitalism that whether we think so or not to know about it or not is it Germany is pretty successful society with\nWith great wages but also great companies are really great companies car companies industrial companies of all kinds and your kitchen perhaps there's a bunch of German companies represented and\nThey have done that in a way that is not\nAt the expense of workers people have health care they don't work twenty nine hours and therefore die of preventable diseases in Germany and they have boards corporate boards that have environmental and community stakeholders on those boards so they don't care about the communities discontent only when you have a\nPopulist demagogue take power they actually hear about them in the board meetings and\nYou have in many parts of the rich world\nHealth care as a guaranteed right for people that is not that is very much part and parcel of the capital of systems they have evolved because they have actually had the intelligence to realize that having people\nStay in jobs they don't like instead of quitting to start a company because they're afraid of losing their health care is actually not very good for capitalism right so what we actually need to do is get off our\nHigh horse in America thinking we're the only capitalist society on earth and actually get out there and study the dozens of people who who are ... of societies that have practiced various forms of capitalism that have created a rainbow of capitalism\nI Would argue that that was the central frame of the Bernie Sanders' campaign to do exactly what but I think burning proposing one specific version that's that's what I'm I'm making a different point which is there's a lot of capitalism is out there 'cause they say we're going to do things like Scandinavian countries we don't even have the only model\nMy what I'm saying is there's a buffet here we can do\nTrade like one country does we can do health care like another country there's there's variety out there that we're not seeing because we are arrogant and were separated by from the rest of the world by notion on either side and we sometimes don't realize that the rest of the world is engaging experiments that would actually be of use to us if we had the humility to learn from them\nThey're selling the door or next caller good morning Salvador\nYeah Hi encouraged I really I'm a I find that I'm\nSaying I I think that one of the most ... thing I'm not George Washington was factually the power um and I like to see the elites putting their money towards building a better democracy instead of their own specific issues than I was curious um are there any um that you're aware of\nIssues than I was curious um are there any um that you're aware of that are focusing on that issue and I'll take my answer off the air\nOkay thank you for that question actually brings up a I was mentioning before we went on the air to an end about um [noise]\nA um interview he did with Kara Swisher who certainly well no one in the world of Silicon Valley on a podcast and\nShe asked you about a place in Oakland that actually works for a responsible government of democracy and everything it's a nonprofit and she said would they would the elite funded and your question was kind of I don't know because you don't know if they would find something like that\nBut I I Want to commend Salvador for that example because I think it's important to this unspoiled that for a second this country the founding president this country is exactly right was a man who's defining act\nAnd defining legacy ended up not winning the revolutionary war all those are really important thing George Washington dead but the the true legacy of George Washington was speeding power but I did want to became\nYou should we didn't want the title and breaking away from Britain would be certainly a good example I might be ... and I just\nCouldn't wait not to be king and\nI think we should just really think about that as heritage that's how this country started as a republic with someone who could have been king\nAnd ceded power and what we have now is a bunch of people who didn't even when a Revolutionary War but he won it became\nA and so I Would think about how do you get people to challenge the spirit channel the spirit of George Washington where president may want to be ember right votes or at least rights hopefully yeah I mean who hopefully not with without clothes in his case um\nI think ... you know we what we\nWhat we need more of is exactly of Salvador suggests that powerful people thinking about if I I Want to live in a society which they have less money to give away however we live where we live now there is this money a lot of money and they're going to be giving it away\nAnd and I would say the key for them it's just it's a think exactly like George Washington think about how do you give in ways that reduce your own power and a lot of that means not running organizations not being in charge not dictating terms\nNot necessarily doing issue advocacy directly because again that's putting your some on the scales but giving in ways that actually create the conditions for better self government over the long term training candidates allowing people are giving workers more power the organization that we're talking about yesterday was workers lab in Oakland giving organizations\nThat that help workers sees more worker power giving empowering those organizations so workers can go seek greater political power", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "04"}
