Stanley has spent the last decade studying fascist propaganda politics and tactics\nHe says that the formula for fascism is surprisingly simple and that's all right wing autocrats follow a similar playbook a vocal last mythic past so divisions and attacked the truth professor Stanley joins us this hour to talk about his new book how fascism works the politics of us and them\nAnd we'll also hear from him about the parallels he sees between President Trump's rhetoric and not have passed dictators and\nWhat do you make sure the president's recent declarations that he's a quote pro nationalist conditions nearly thank you very much good to have you with us this morning let's get to that nationalist characterization first or how much are we to link that or or ugly to link there to fascism\nWell I think that not national fascism requires nationalism not all nationalist movements are fascist but nationalism is the core of a fascist ideology I mean my ...\nIs a not to compare I'm not comparing the president to Hitler I bought a darn many different fascist movements only one of which was the national socialist but\nMine confident argument for a national state\nA Hitler wants to deconstruct the ah the the state to sort of bureaucratic state and replace it by a heart by a by a national state by which he means a state based on a particular nationality an ethnicity in his case Iran as them\nSo nationalism is different from patriotism patriotism the NYU a philosopher towns in Shaw recently tweeted today\nPatriotism is allegiance to a political entity that incorporates specific moral and political virtues whereas nationalism is allegiance to a real or imagined cultural or ethnic community\nAnd that's how Hitler means ... nation to nation state the nation and the national state in mind come he means a cultural or ethnic community by not say a set of doctrines our surroundings say liberty and equality of the sort of try and in the constitution\nI'm Glad you made the division between nationalism and patriotism\nBecause George Orwell made it and you made it quite a illuminating lily I should say but nationalism particularly for those who are afraid of a Trump being identified with the kind of fascism that you write about it and in particularly because of Charlottesville and because of excluding\nA different groups with different interests on the right color last and they they band together and you end up having an inconsistent group but altogether one not\nThat aims that that ends up ah looking fascists so uh I think ... so fascism is an ideology based on power loyalty and fear of the other\nUh it's harshly patriarchal the idea is that ah that at the very center of it is power is loyalty to a nation to a national like ethnic identity and which is represented in the body of a strong leader who represents and speaks for that nation\nBut when I look at the actual of\nNeo conservative estimate is more like globalism [laughter] grief but I what I look at actually you have ten a ways of looking at what constitutes fascism a kind of a deck a log of sorts a and I'm\nI'm struck by a lot of the things the charges were made against our president for example anti intellectual um unreality facts are they based without a common understanding a hierarchy fascist politicians attempt to prove natural divisions between us and them\nVictimhood any games for minorities them or a loss for us\nA law and order criminals lawlessness a native policing\nThese are the kinds of things that are they do fit to some extent patterns of many see and the president\nBut also the lying in the ... um that is identify with the president also seemed to be almost characteristic of every fascist regime but make the distinction if you would cause you make it in your book between fascist politics in the fascist state it's an important one\nRight so fascist politics is employing certain tactics to gain power fascism remmer as an ideology based on power loyalty and fear of the other so fascist tactics are\nTactics are tactics that you used to seize power once you seize power well you can do different things and historically\nPeople who employ these tactics did do different things must ... did not commit genocide in Italy a mean he killed many people in in Ethiopia and Eritrea but\nHe didn't commit genocide in in Italy he didn't focus on the Jews are people fascist tactics and fascist politics are a set of tactics that are describing how propaganda works to seize power and hold onto it what you do when you make when you get power\nWell that may not you know that's going to differ from country to country\nAnd I think what we face in the United states is very clearly fascist tactics and fascist politics and that that are that are increasingly popular and increasingly are effective in our country as we lose our democratic culture\nOr ... which does not mean that we have a fascist government we clearly did not have the fashion\nBut she makes a point that with a fascist tactics you can lead not only to serious repression freedoms are big but you're dehumanizing off in a group and\nThat can turn to justifying inhumane treatment that can also turn to a aggression of all different sorts of mess imprisonment and uh even extermination\nShouldn't have all different sorts of mess imprisonment and uh even extermination I mean you mentioned genocide is certainly lived there in Germany but it led there\nAre in Rwanda lived there in Myanmar which is curiously enough or becoming a more democratic state at the same time that it's taking their all hang out with people in a sense of committing genocide against them so we we got to democracy for some democracy for some yeah thank you for this [laughter] oh [laughter]\n... except that editorial come in because I think that's absolutely correct or wherever wonders concern but the picture gets crowded and many people's minds because\nAnd I think this is an important point that you make authoritarianism and a autocratic uh tactics which are identified with fascism can be very veiled and they can come under different or shall we say appearances and so the reality behind them sometimes is not seen\n[noise] that's right and they they are they and you know and leaders hints at them I mean\nThe president is not as explicit as I said ... and in Brazil who's openly promising a extrajudicial killings and a talks about an open and says clearly ... a so fashioned fascist politics as harshly homophobic\nHarshly patriarchal ... says he's rather said he's rather rather I'd rather have a debt some that are gay son\nAh so you have this harsh patriarchal politics because in fascism and fascist ideology the father of the nation\nStatus of the nation as the father of the fat of a patriarchal family stands to the rest of the family he has the protector he is the protector of his women and children\nSince you say in the twenties sixteen convention or you you highlight of the fact that Donald Trump's that I Am your voice\nYes that's a fascist tactics\nTo represent himself as the voice and that I mean Kanye West when he went to the White House people\nPeople criticize Kanye West for for not being coherent but I heard him being very coherent he said you know I grew up in a home without a father and you know when I put on this hot I feel like I have a father I feel like you represent\nYou played his father role and that's how fast is politics works that's of course not sufficient but it's one part a fascist politics at the leader as the father ah in in the patriarchal sense they\nThey lead by strength and dominance not by moral authority\nThere's also just the fact that facts known really work and fascism orange stirring up nationalism and the more toxic sense I'm\nThinking about ... for example who said the masses aren't necessarily convinced by the facts and when you have someone who's more fascist rolling it can be a member of a minority group in fact many that fascist states were minority groups that took over the majority of the people took over the messes with their ideas and was propaganda and this is a very important tool for fascism\nWhere you have to break liberal democracy relies on truth\nLiberal democracy is too great values\nAnd this is where my patriotism comes in to liberty and equality liberty requires truth because if you don't have truth you're not free no one thinks that the people of North Korea are free because they've been lied to they literally do not know what they're doing they don't know why they're doing what they're doing so they're not free because they're operating on the basis of\nMisinformation and equality requires truth because equality is politically quality democracy allows us to have differences in wealth but you have to be able to speak truth to power\nSo if you're going to smash liberal democracy then you need to smash truth or if it you know fascism again it's an ideology based on power loyalty and fear of the other so unique to smash truth\nYou need to make people be value truth I think it's not important you know that fascists politics is taking a grip when people don't care about the truth when they literally think it's my team it's my guy versus to them\nAnd it doesn't matter if my guy is lion that just shows that he's a strong leader that he knows that it's a war it's a struggle Hitler's book is called my struggle it's just a struggle and meaning comes from struggle and victory and is it a victory\nIs a gives you value it's all about winners and so what truth does is it levels that off truth says hey it doesn't matter what side you're on there is the world and the world makes it the case that there are no sites 'cause that's the world so you need to destroy the truth and then you just have power\nAnd fascist leaders need enemies right\nFascist leaders needs enemies because they need to be winners and they need to be losers so you need you need them you need them because it defines us to any of them are the are the threat that you need to and you need to show that you dominate them so we're ... we're\nTalking

and\nWas rejected by such a thing that I ... in American politics that the pendulum will swing back\nTo the left but the last century it\nBecause as an immigrant here Twenty years ago it was much more hostile living here in\nYou're you're asked to look by gene into your tea leaves thoughts\nSo I'm not a ... uh I I this is not what I Do look into the future a and a and I'm close to make predictions um I mean I Would just say that we've long had these inclinations or if you look at our\nIf you look at what's faced black Americans are historically in the United states take fake news think of all the fake news and the Nineteen nineties that ginned up the machine of mass incarceration a super predator theory I said you know people saying there was going to be a huge\nA super predator theory as you know people saying there was going to be a huge wave of violent crime that never materialized a but we've had all this fake news we've had all this hatred of mind of minority groups in this country we've long had these elements what we have now is we have we have\nPoliticians exploiting that these features of the United states and\n... you know making America great again returning us to a grim past\nWhen it gets away with you because you know there's some fascinating things in your book about a Hitler being inspired by the confederacy and Jim Crow which uh\nI had never to come across before um but also the idea that somehow maybe Donald Trump when he says a make America great again he's saying let's get back to slavery and Jim Crow that that that's a pretty stretch for a lot of people even people who were anti Trump\nI'm I'm not seeing what else could be meant we've struggled so hard in this country and we struggled large you know with only limited success against our\nOur demons or advocate it to me as as a patriotic American I mean it's an incredible story I mean the civil rights movement is an incredible story um\nThese are the the movement for gay rights as an incredible story and when someone talks about returning us I mean that you know they couldn't return us you know what we have here is is a subtle winking I mean they could be promising us a new deal\nBut we're not seeing that we're not seeing\nThe infrastructure plan we've been promised we're not seeing Bannon's economic nationalism we're seeing giant tax cuts and we're seeing\nA transgender rights rolled back we're seeing gay rights rolled back we're seeing a ah we're seeing a vicious anti refugee and immigrant an outsider rhetoric\nSo we are seeing we're talk we're seeing the Nineteen twenty four immigration act being revived in sort of talk about revived\nSo we're seeing the make America great again that seems to be meant is nothing new deal it's not it's not government spending on a on various projects uh for for the benefit of workers it seems to be the parts of our past that ah\nThat a liberal democracy I should overcome\nBecause it'd be a citizen many people's minds just let's go back to what we had before Obama particularly maybe when Reagan was president\nAh it ah the Nineteen eighties um could that be what's meant well a Steve Bannon in the Hollywood Reporter interview specifically referenced the Nineteen thirties\nAnd a ban in a smart or he's obviously leaves it open whether he means the new deal part of the Nineteen thirties or whether he means the time of the Nineteen thirties\nThe aspect of the Nineteen thirties\nAmerica First of folks which is the time when America America first movement was essentially the face of American fashion\nIs also the time when America was in a deep depression is less we forgot in Nineteen thirties you want to revoke the Nineteen thirties or in a well let me get some more callers of war here Daniel joined us here on the air good morning\nGood morning a Baker being guest I've read your book I like it very much and they weren't you're spending time on the chat rooms and a Fifteen Years now that there are plenty of factor in this country with an electric power and all that degree of course\nWhether that makes the entire Republican Party is sick at different question\nMy question for you or do you consider consider Japan of the Nineteen thirties and World War two as they are shifting country and have a follow up on that as well\nWell I'd like to be clear that my experts cheeses on ideology and propaganda and I think that a ... you you really need a political economist the story and a political economy\nAre adults and their story end of the structure of governments to tell you a about different about what a fascist regime looks like\nUm I think you can have fascist politics without a fascist regime are now whether there was a I think\nBased on religion I mean a lot of Japanese thought it was based on ... and its ideology as well we see you can certainly\nYou can certainly so one of the examples chief examples in my book of a fascist movement is the Hindu for movement in India\nAh which is a religious movement Hindu nationalism which is a classically it's uh our our sauce a ... a ... the party that originally sort of channel that\nUh was explicitly influenced by European fascist movements and but the idea was you know the idea is Hindu nationalism it's er religiously based movement\nUm and I think some elements of the Israeli writes\nFar far writes I'm a ... disturbingly reflect that so you can certainly have the kinds of fascism involves us politics of purity and you know where where the fear of the other is based on the other polluting you\nAnd you ... you know so you you talk about so in fact fascist ideology like foreigners are pollutants you might talk of them as sort of a horrible\nDangers to your women as rapists or or diseases or invasions and I and you can have that based on religion you as we see in India Today you can have that based on a on skin color or\nA or a variety of ethnic sources\nIs a Islamic fascism there is Jewish fascism there is fascism definitely tied to religion or culture our or nationality I mean to all of those that we've [noise] um let me get some more callers aboard here and again we're talking to Jason Stan Lee and his new book is called how fascism works the politics of us\nAnd his new book is called how fascism works the politics of us and them and here's an Oakland or Stephen you're on the air [laughter]\nHi um okay so in the last election a presidential election I'm Hillary Clinton you could say a lot more so than anything because of the lack of\nTurnout and so my question is I'm In regard to combating fascism it seems like the left has an apathy problem where the Democratic party um\nTheir platform a parallel the majority of Americans want but the voting poll a of the electorate um the Democrats don't really have that many left leaning\nVoters to choose from because a lot of the voters that aligned with Democrats are simply not voting at the same rate\nSeemingly just have one quick correction uh appreciate your question and we'll go to the professor Stanley in a moment but we did a program just yesterday was Carolyn Anderson who talked about voter suppression in the last election and made the case that\nUh Wisconsin and Florida particularly because of voter suppression probably turn the election to Trump or an electoral college I mean she does make a fairly good case for that but I mean do you live with with uh the question we're hearing from Stephen ... professor Stanley\n... so I I'm a huge admirer of Carol I understand I just want to say and I think she's absolutely right I mean\nFlorida has what and I just want to emphasize your point Michael that that one point four million\nOr people are disenfranchising in Florida for a four previous felonies we're the only country on earth practices felon disenfranchisement I mean people who've committed felonies felonies are still citizens most liberal democracies prisoners vote people in prison votes\nSo when you look at that practice that uniquely American practice that arises you know basically you know [laughter]\nThat is racially base that that means it's connected to racialized mass incarceration or when you have this current moment where we have this fear ... return to Jim Crow to to voter suppression as Carolyn Anderson\nBrilliantly documents um we have this war on our democracy what about the\nCaller's point though is a professor sent me saying there's a great deal of apathy and the EPA see if feeds into the fascist a Gemini wherever it is that's\nThat's right that's right I I mean what we're seeing as we're seeing Republican Party that seeks to rule is a minority but it's still the case that we have a problem with apathy that if we got all the voters out who could vote who would vote 'em this would be\nDefeated or not the Republican Party per se but certainly the politics that disturbing sort of politics that we're seeing\nCisco presenting new Web backs meetings used by

back to have you back and as we get into a discussion of extremism and\nRepublican Party and your conversion I Want to ask you first about the explosive devices that were sent to CNN and a number of\nProminent Democrats and President Trump's tweet which came out this morning suggesting that the mainstream media is false and inaccurate reporting as he described it is to blame in some way what do you make of the state of affairs\nI Am deeply disturbed by about what is going on Michael I'm not entirely surprising fact last week and one of my columns for the Washington Post I said that the social fabric is in danger of ripping leading to violence on the streets and sadly that seems to be coming true\nI think the primary culprit here is President Trump was engaged and incendiary rhetoric of the kind that we have never before seen from an American president\nI mean what does he think it's going to happen when he describes the the media as the enemy of the people are he says that Democrats are evil they're traders they want to destroy our borders and let in MS Thirteen and a rapist sent and killers and\nThey want to turn America into another Venezuela I mean this is poisonous rhetoric\nOr and he also in engages in vitriolic personal attacks against people like Maxine Waters and\nGeorge Soros and Hillary Clinton\nSo you know if there is some lunatic out there who has been inspired by\nBy Trump's words to try to carry out a campaign of mass terrorism against these targets that is hardly surprising I mean we don't know exactly what the story with the with the bombs those ... and we got to find that out but ah there is no question in my mind that Donald Trump is creating a very dangerous climate in this country which is\nVastly increasing the risk of political violence\nTo find the toy rhetoric is simply no doubt about that and it's also the kind of rhetoric that targets people specifically who have been targeted by these pipe bombs but\nYou're hearing from the other side from Trump supporters that this is maybe a false flag and it's I don't know where this comes from but held up really to a essentially divert people's interests are and maybe make more Democrats vote for the Democratic party or those who feel that maybe on the border that they should vote for the Democratic party\nAll of it I mean where where do you START I mean I think uh his presidency has been an abomination I mean he stands in opposition to so many of the things that I Believe in such as free trade such as American global leadership\nBut it goes well beyond a disagreement on the issues ah it's basically the fact that I think he is unfit to be president I think he is lowering our moral tone he is dividing our country use engaging and racism Xena phobia\nA massage any for political purposes use his cruelty I find to be utterly repugnant or the way that he attacks those weaker than himself like Christine Blasey Ford for example while at the same time couch talented dictators like Vladimir potent and Kim Jong on a or now to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nOr you know he is the least ethical president I think an artistry years a pathological liar who lives on average of eight times a day\nOr in spreads pig lies he insights violence he dies damage to our democracy by demonizing the media I mean I could sit here all day and talk to you about\nUh what do I what I object to about him what's what's shocking to me is that a forty percent of the population are so actually approves of him that not to me is very dispiriting\nWell you indicated before that there's a kind of fuzzy environment of the Republican Party made which is one of the things that you condemn and a speak very unfavorably about to put it mildly and that was over ... you're talking about justice isn't certainly tax cuts and all the things that have come to a passenger Trump's leadership one could argue\nBut there's also really stirring up the other ... er and getting on their side was being opposed to abortion I mean there are real issues here that really have a great deal to do is appealed don't they\nWell of course I mean he he speaks to a right wing agenda even though he violates a lot of the principles of what I Would consider to be conservatism I mean again the the kind of conservatism I grew up with in the Nineteen eighties under Ronald Reagan was pro immigration and it was pro American global leadership\nHe was getting money that rated should wanted free trade Israel\nDoubt a fiscal responsibility support for law enforcement all these things that\nThat the Republicans have have turned against than even family values I mean it's pretty rich to me that all these other ... love Donald Trump because they think he's gonna ban abortion but they're willing to overlook the fact that he is not exactly a paragon of moral ... I mean what what what would they upset if there was a Democrat who\nWas found to be violating campaign finance laws to pay off at playboy playmate and a porn star I mean you can you imagine the streaks of outrage from the right but with Donald Trump they don't care\nNext food is with us his new book is called the corrosion conservatism why I left the right and he's appearing at the commonwealth club today at noon here in San Francisco with their science to earlier on I mean let's talk about it I mean Lee Atwater for example comes to mind Newt Gingrich a you know talking about\nHow a full scale war has to go on against the Democrats all of this kind of rhetoric that seem to be the darker side I mean you could certainly say\nThe darker side was a pit of mice in some ways by Richard Nixon even going back that far I understand your enthusiasm about Reagan but\nNixon was from ms ... pretty now much understand that the darker side as well\nWe're a lot of signs along the way that I turned a blind eye to because I was very deep\nIn the tribal bubble I was very deep and in in the partisan bubble and for example in the past\nWhen Democrats would say that Republicans were ... or catering to racism I thought that was a terrible slur on the good name of Republicans because I thought hey I'm not racist my friends aren't racist what are you talking about and then of course Donald Trump went and did it so clearly\nSponsorship indicate the lady live stream thanks Sandy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in how why for ultimately there's in the home\nSouthern strategy was a way of kind of\nClogging I'm going to get there in a second but ah ah you know with with Donald Trump appealing so blatant leader racism do something I can no longer denied it made me realize wait a second\nThere is a much more substantial constituency and the Republican Party for racism for Zena phobia than I ever imagined that Donald Trump brought that into the open and because of that what I've done is I've also had to go back and rethink the entire modern history of the conservative movement and the Republican Party which is something that I Do in this book\nAnd I realized wait a second Donald Trump didn't spring out of nowhere that there are these roots uh in in this fanaticism and this bigotry on the right stretching all the way back to the birth of the modern conservative movement the Nineteen fifties and for example in the course of writing this book I went back and\nYou know read the works of people like Barry Goldwater and Phyllis Schlafly and I'd always thought it was a terrible liable to call them extremists even though\nVery Goldwater themselves so that he was an extremist at the Nineteen sixty four Republican convention but actually looking at what they had to say the fact that for example Barry Goldwater opposed the great civil rights legislation of Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty five\nThe fact that ah he called for threatening the Soviet Union with nuclear war if they tried to repress another uprising in Eastern Europe\nThese really are extremist and in fanatical concepts and they're deeply rooted in the Republican Party and the conservative movement I don't think that they defined that to a tally of conservatism because I think there are also been some positive strands of conservatism\nBut this is really made me realize that there's always been this dark underside uh which was much greater than I'd been willing to acknowledge when I thought to myself as a movement conservative and where's the Tea Party fit\nI think the Tea Party is part of the growing radicalized station or the Republican Party in recent years I mean you've seen\nUh the Republican Party get more and more extremists going back to the Nineteen nineties really with Newt Gingrich\nFox News a Sarah Palin the Tea Party these are all steps along the way that led us eventually to the final destination being Donald Trump or at least I Hope it to the final destination because they're really scary thing is there could be somebody after Donald Trump who was even worse\nTalking to Max Boot his new book is a corrosion of conservatism way left or right you are [noise]\nWe're on the right in many ways I don't want to push on the couch here but you know your father gave you a copy of National Review you or your father wrote for Sunnyside you came from Russia where there was a lot of anger at the evil empire and the Republicans seem to in many ways a pit in my eyes are\nStanding up against Russia and I have a president who John Bolton who is one of those conservatives is giving national security advice to and so forth he was very anti rationality shaken hands with putting in a\n... won't even go to the high end after he we spent an hour I had yesterday but what I'm interested in finding out about you is how much does it personal fit into your political views because you were very wedded to the political party largely because she came out of Russia and were refused they\nAbsolutely uh in in a lot of what I loved about the Republican Party under Ronald Reagan was the moral clarity the fact that Ronald Reagan called out the evil empire he spoke up for dissidents he said Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall I loved that\nBut you're talking about going to be very us as it were bombing Russia and if you miss that I mean there was a sense of I think\nReagan was actually fairly proven in his use of force he didn't go round starting wars he certainly wasn't gonna risk World War three and\nAnd one to Reagan's great credit when he finally how to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he could work with he understood that he could cut deals with him that he could in the Cold War with them and a lot of right winters are very opposed to that so Reagan was a lot more moderate in office I Would say and some of the campaign a rhetoric would lead you to suspect\nBut the irony here is of course Ronald Reagan was standing up against the evil empire and now\nA Donald Trump is is ... to\nUh to the successors or the evil empire I mean he's saying that uh that ... is a strong man he never criticizes putting he says that he is in love with Kim Jong on who was one of the worst human rights violators on the planet he has very little negative to say about the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who in all likelihood\nWas responsible for the death in December meant of a journalist just recently uh to me this was a complete loss of of the Republican Party has completely lost its way\nThat the president also says I'm a nationalist and he says you know I'm looking out for America's interests America First all that kind of argument and essentially that doesn't hold water with you\nWell that's very frightening to me because we all know what the connotations of nationalism are in the modern world this is the ideology of people like Viktor Orban and ... and I think\nDonald Trump knows that as well just as one he said that his foreign policy was America First he was invoking the failed isolationist than in in in de facto pro fascist\nMovement or in in the late thirties early forties to Charles Lindbergh going back to Charles Lindbergh he is\nPlaying with some very dangerous historical forces I never thought I Would see an American president embracing America First embracing nationalism or engaging in this kind of vilification or the opposition party incitement to violence demonization of minorities\nI mean these are very very dangerous trends we've seen in other countries\nWhere these kinds of things leading to a very ugly place\nTequila next mood and you can join us let me invite you to do that now I told the numbers available to you it's eight six six seven three three six seven eight six we welcome

participation you're listening ... Michael Krasny [noise]\n\nAny kind of criticism what are the most precious things he said was I could shoot somebody that that and the supporters of mine is based in mind would not do anything\nExactly I think that's exactly right but remember not a hundred percent of Donald Trump supporters hardcore I mean about forty percent of the country supports Trump\nI Would say about thirty percent of that is a thirty percent of the public is really hard core Trump supporters people who are very enthusiastic about him but they're also people kind of hold their nose don't like him so much but say the economy is going great so\nYou know reluctantly I support him or I don't like the Democrats I think what's going to change their minds is not anything I say or do although I'm trying my damn this then you know five any credibility as a former Republican and a lifelong conservative which I Hope I Do and I'm saying you know vote democratic I Hope a few people will be listening to that but\nYou know I'm not so conceded to think that what what I said personally is going to necessarily change the minds of a lot of Trump supporters I think what would change minds however\nIs if you see an economic downturn I mean the fact is that the stock market is down for the year housing prices are down a lot of economists are predicting the recession by twenty twenty and if that were to happen I think it would be catastrophic for Donald Trump standing when\nWe thank you for the call or here's a rubber do says this next to think that President Trump is a fascist we spent some time yesterday was chasing Stanley who is a your professors written a book on fascism and uh [noise] pretty much a outlines a lot of things to make for fascism pretty well academically but making a lot of sense from your perspective\nYou know I think you can certainly make that case in fact I think it was in the fall of twenty Fifteen when I actually tweeted Trump is advocating fascism and I think there is a lot of truth in that I mean when he says I Am a nationalist I think that's basically a code word to suggest that is the direction which he is which he is headed I mean of course you know\nCensorship that the cake you eat Eve I dream Kennedy from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV any time anywhere on any device with the Kennedy on demand\nThey should know minorities the cult of personality the incitement to violence these are a lot of the classic characteristics the fascism and do you see him you see Donald Trump exhibiting those uh I mean the the good news here of course is that\nAmerica does not have a weak political system like Italy in the Nineteen twenties or Argentina in the fifties or Venezuela and the two thousands\nOr so even if you have a president who is basically a fascist we have a much more old boss liberal democracy with much stronger checks and balances so I don't think he's actually going to succeed and implanting fascism here but there is no question that that is the direction which has sympathies lie I guess is\nMax Boot his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left to right and uh [noise]\nHere's a tweet from ... recent some Republicans don't like Trump is because he puts an ugly face on their ugly policies aside from Trump's disgusting character and idiocy he has largely been a rubber stamp for every policy and appointment Republicans have wanted they want to pass these policies but with a nice face on it\nAnd Joseph says so name a few conservative presidential candidates could run the table in the next election like Trump did in the last one I don't like the guy but he gets done as there'll be Jason at least these are SOB\nWell I think we all agree that he's not so big anyway um I I resist the notion that Trump is just a normal conservative I mean I think that there are\nSome conservative policies that he's implementing for example the tax cuts and the judge is I think any Republican president would do that\nBut I think Donald Trump is really redefining conservatism he's very different from Ronald Reagan for example who again was pro immigration he never Reagan celebrated immigrants he didn't demonize them Trump is a populist he's a national CSA ... fascist I think he is redefining the ... the Republican Party along those lines\nGetting things done that's the point of that color I mean a lot of Republicans see it that way and that's why they've fallen in love you can as a day\nI don't I don't know what he's really getting done I mean\nThe two big things that he's gotten done from the Republican prospective are he's cut taxes and he's gotten conservative judges appointed okay but he does not have a lot of achievements other than that and a lot of what he's promoting\nAre things that Republicans used to oppose like protectionism terrorists by the late ... those are tax increases on the one hand he's cutting some taxes but he's also increasing taxes and you're seeing a lot of companies right now talk about what a big hit to the bottom line is terrorists are and how that slowing down the economy so\nYou know I think Republicans are fooling themselves or they think Trump is delivering some kind of conservative agenda\nThere was a color from Texas who dropped I would've liked to have gone to him essentially he said\nUh I'm a Trump supporter and the reason I'm a Trump supporters I wanted to throw grenades at all this uh [noise]\nTerrible stuff that's going on in Washington I mean Trump did a pill a lot of people 'cause he said I'm going to drain the swamp turns out to have its own swamps because besides ... these filling up the swamp but there were a lot of people who felt that way he's a disruptor we liked disruption\nI I I find that to be just perverse and it complete misunderstanding of America historically and comparatively in the world because yeah people have always been unhappy about what's going on in Washington and I've been very unhappy about a lot of things in Washington but we need to keep things in perspective America is still\nA a vibrant democracy we are still peaceful a by and large\nCrime is very low how the economy is going very well uh we ... you know we we live by any historical standard in a very free and secure society that's what what Donald Trump inherited in in twenty Seventeen\nSo this notion that we somehow to blow everything up and everything was terrible that's just ridiculous that's nonsensical a and Donald Trump and the notion that Donald Trump would actually improve things is absurd because he is a swamp creature himself\nHe is actually a ... probably the most unethical president in our history he has full of conflicts of interest you will not reveal his taxes he was engaging obstruction of justice\nOr he lives in an average of eight times a day so the notion that somebody like Donald Trump free\nGoodness figure the eight lies a day of Washington Post fact checkers Glenn Kessler keeps a running tally it's an average of a ... a day that it was higher than that but let me get some more callers on the go to Steve Steve you're on\nYeah Hi um this is a I mean the Republican Party left me a long time ago but ah yeah the Republicans were born out of the ashes are the wigs rep and what's so ripping ripping today all brace Donald Trump\nOr you know where is there some kind of geographical next is that you know where we see the rise of this great center party that we've all been waiting for\nWell I don't know if there is a geographical nexus and I think one of the difficulties in American politics today is that there are a lot of moderates and centrists but they're spread out\nAnd there's you know there's a critical mass of Trump voters in red states there is a critical mass of democratic voters and blue states\nAnd there's a lot of disaffected independence and all those places I mean the largest political party in America's actually people who are not affiliated with any political party that's about forty two percent of the population Democrats are about twenty nine percent Republicans twenty seven percent so there's a lot of people who feel like the political parties\nAre not representing them but our system is basically gained in favor of the two party do awfully and politicians in both the Democratic and Republican Party have a major incentive to pander to their base they're afraid of losing primaries so they they want to go\nUp to the right or the left and so now you know somebody who is on the center right I feel politically homeless\nThat's the big I'm told that Trump has in terms of turning Republicans or to drink the Kool Aid is you put it isn't it that he has his base and they're afraid the vase could actually make them lose their job yes that's why\nShould they're afraid the vase could actually make them lose their job\nYes that's why jumped right that's why no politicians in Washington are brave enough to stand up to him because they can you can see you of any terror greater than losing their job and so they have given up their principles in order to keep their jobs I think it's a disgrace that more Republicans have not spoken up for conservative principles\nYou were pretty disappointed in Rubio especially it seems you thought he was a principled guy\nI was I mean I was a foreign policy adviser for senator Rubio's campaign and I\nThrilled to him when he said that Donald Trump was not qualified that he was a con man he should not be the end of the nuclear codes and as I ride on the book I was totally cops smacked when when Rubio went from saying that the saying I endorse this con man I mean how can you possibly do that but it was so common\nOr I mean you start with Ted Cruz for example who called Trump a pathological liar\nWho said that uh\nYou know the the worst things you can possibly imagine about him and then went on to endorse him it was just literally embracing him a few days ago and Houston you have to ask do these people have\nAny principles will in fact the other stuff that Trump said about uh Cruz's father and the rather egregious besides ... says about quiz his wife and yet you know you're supporting cruise now he's author of campaigning for Cruz it's\nUh it makes you really wonder where the principals are as you said this show or if they're already to begin with who shows up as soon as I challenge Max Boot unaffected Seventy percent of the public supported the Iraq War just figure is correct but only after the media and the government lie to the American public to convince them that Saddam Hussein was it part responsible for the nine eleven attacks\nWell I don't think the the uh the government or the responsible media was claiming that Saddam Hussein was responsible for nine eleven some people may have thought that I think with the current was saying was that he had weapons of mass destruction a nuclear program\nAnd I don't think that was a lie I think that was in misjudgment on the part of the CIA as well as other western intelligence agencies have critical misjudgment but even if you believe that he had W. M. D. development as\nAs these intelligence agencies genuinely did that doesn't necessarily mean you had to launch a preemptive war against them in here I plead guilty because I was certainly one of those people who was making the case for that preventive conflict and in hindsight I think that was tragically mistaken I was wrong\nI met there we'll start with that but it's live with a crash reported in Redwood City and what a window or spotted Whipple possibly suffer from a crash was already out there at willow ...

explosives to help with its investigation of Tuesday's fire at the construction site and they one hundred and twenty six unit townhouse complex\nItself is housing construction site fire in the Oakland in Emeryville area in the past two years and three of those earlier fires were started by our son is\nA group of developers suggests that the fires maybe a political act against gentrification and offered a three hundred thousand dollar reward to help catch what they are calling the urban terrorists\nToday and for them and this hour we're going to hear more about these fires what they say about possible tensions in Oakland and what the city is doing to address it joined yesterday's Libby chef mayor of Oakland welcome\nIrish and they'll always great to be here Michael\nHave you here in Denver is with us as well editor and reporter for the news will come down to morning Michael that let's begin with you or are we seeing a pattern here to stay still under investigation but there are many who feel that this is definitely linked to political action and political tensions\nWell I think people will fill in the blanks when they don't know what the reasons are\nBut uh the the context is pretty clear um we've been talking about displacement and gentrification for years in a in Oakland and elsewhere\nAnd and so people are going to see that as a theme when they see these very large a and also very vulnerable went under construction I'm a housing sites go up in flames\nUm we had a reporter out on the street at a ... across the street from the fire the other morning Raquel Maria Dylan\nAnd she talked to a neighborhood resident who was on his way to work with stop to watch and he said hey listen I grew up in this neighborhood people here are angry about a gentrification but\nYou know this isn't the way to answer it [noise] um so you know as to what really happened here it is under investigation you mentioned the Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives or agency\nThat are sent in twenty or twenty member team yesterday\nThere are going to go over the site you know are you looking for any forensic as evidence that they're\nThe opened fire department and police are looking into this and you know there are other you know there are these other adjunct incident there was another episode on Tuesday Morning where there is a fire discovered less than a mile away at a housing site under construction\nA there's a report that are in late April this very a development that burned the other morning at um Myrtle and west grand\nThat's that was outside of my control but that's why I have gotten very vocal on a regional wide basis to say that we as a region have got to put renter protections in place and have got to put regional measures in place to produce the kind of revenues that the whole bay area needs to address this housing crisis\nWhere we're getting a lot of response from colors let's get as many of us we can and let's begin with an Oakland caller named Dave Dave you're on foreign\nHow you doing today [laughter]\nSo am I going to stand up or down or ... or ... or the regular you know high rent 'em out to 'em\nAbout more affordable housing is more where when you have you got to worry about big here than it does it get out or that he thought the person and I'm looking for a job they can go get a trade\nOr not so good of you know building all these beautiful garden but how about has some you know\nAnd then you know people can actually you are like social worker who can have in order to help people to get with that or training or\nYou know you got people in the community that's going to um work together you know and fired it out\nBut I Do too important questions when we go first to down brick you on the rents and what we're talking about the well\nThe um I I Believe all of these fires that we're looking at are all market rate housing developments and generally speaking that's for people with above moderate incomes\nAnd chefs are also want to know what a smart housing and a short and long advocated Abdullah can be done on yeah well\nAnd I'm actually the ice house was Martin housing and a lot of ways um well it was kind of below market it was not protected and that's that's what we need to be unclear about kind of deed restricted\nHousing where the rent levels are protected as staying low\nEven if they're below market rate upon construction or in an ice house was smart and that it was very ecological but as far as the ... or job training and pre school\nUm we don't have a facility problem as much as we have a operations problem out what makes us a facilities expensive\nIs paying the every year operating expenses and salaries of the people that have to run them\nAnd so if you'll indulge me Michael I Want to put a pitch out for measure eight eight in Oakland measure aimed would fund preschool or for every four year old and so that's where we really have got to I'm a dentist five funding sources is not as much for the buildings it's for the people in them that work everyday\nAnd let me thank you day for the call and we go next to Dennis who actually lives there are much to talk about the fires were they were to live nude Tuesday fire does\nSay they're gearing yeah I'm I'm just as you know I'm a yeah go ahead\nI'm very close to the fire and I've seen 'em I saw the fire happen in a lab\nWith gasoline no people are going on during the ...\n[noise] well I'll tell you right after the Waverly Place a fire we had a huge convening actually is a series of meetings with all of the current builders in Oakland\nAnd we put our heads together about what the best security measures were and I want to recognize that a number of these arsons were caught because of the enhanced security measures\nAre you've heard that they had Eighteen cameras on the site we have protocols to make sure that our police department and fire department and know about projects that are in that vulnerable stage of construction that is one of the things that has been disturbing about the fires that have happened\nIt it seems like someone knows when that vulnerable stage is so we have been working together\nTo increase safety and and clearly some of that has paid off because we have caught some of these fires before they become problems\n... to Oakland fires stuffing and safety looked like post ... do\nYou know I I honestly can't give you a a good update on that I mean I Know that you know the Ghost Ship firing especially the of a fatal fire or at San Pablo and twenty fifth last year\nPut a real spotlight on a staffing and inspections safety inspections at the fire department we're doing and they have have beefed up things since then exact numbers and staffing I Can't tell you\nDo we know the causes a both these four hundred do we actually know causes of specifically as if I were talking about well\nI mean as we were saying before the one this week is officially under investigation there was a there is a I'm a big one in downtown Oakland north to big town Oakland downtown Oakland or a earlier this year that is a a I think was ruled as undetermined\nNow these three others a mirror chef just mentioned Waverly Place that's near San paddling MacArthur and then a western avenue bills or arson fires I mean I think there was evidence there's video evidence and at least one of those cases of somebody leaving the scene\nAnd I do want to point out that I mean I'm\nYou know these fires do happen um there was a big arson fire in Concord earlier this year they're burned a hundred and eighty units now I don't I haven't heard anybody ascribe a political motive to that so there are other reasons and a a a ... could be part of it that other that that people do this\nAnd I'm like I don't really want to um hit on the caller's point about this anger at newcomers um and and this this feeds into the national\nFear mongering about others and it's it's got to be very clear to people that if you want to protect Oakland families we should welcome new housing construction and attack on new housing is an attack on keeping Oakland family's house\nPeople are moving into our city\nUh they've discovered it's secret sauce uh and if we do not build new places for them to move into they have been and will continue to displace the people who are here now and that is why if you are against displacement you should be for new construction\nQuestion Marcia from a listener named Robert who says please talk about the development of the tower now under construction of MacArthur barred which

vehicles\nUm so I uh I have a different perspective on that project a we also know that Oakland does need more retail and when we require it in ground floor sometimes it takes a minute for the market to catch up but if you look at uptown those storefronts were vacant five years ago and boy are they bustling today\n[noise] say something before we close off because we're coming under this half hour Sigmund if you would ... about uh your hopes for the investigation ongoing and also the prevention of more of these fires\nLet's be clear arson is a heinous crime it is not a crime against property it is a crime against life\nAnd that's why we are putting so many resources into discovering who is responsible because as it is really a miracle that no one has died as a cause of these horrible fire\nBecause if people in Oakland have full faith and an investigation because you're working with a a Fifteen hours well\nAbsolutely we need everyone's cooperation if you see suspicious activity

again and the people in our habitat and so we're going to fight tooth and nail to make sure that we allow California's coastline\nTo be a rich resource for us in all different ways and so we're prepared to go to court if necessary uh against the Trump Administration if it tries to pursue this\nA proposed policy of drilling off the coast of our shores anymore a litigation insight here\nImmediately or imminently there there there are a number of things we're preparing for in the event that the Trump Administration tries to ah change the law by breaking the law uh and so we'll be prepared but we're hoping that though of someone a mock some sense into them or your\nUm [noise] opponent Mr Bailey says this area has been spent his time in office on frivolous lawsuits against President Trump and his policies essentially wasting the power the statewide office he's totally consumed by what's going on in Washington filing a lawsuit over\nEvery tweet that comes from Trump or this is Bailey again quote frankly when our first responders are being targeted when\nUh this is Bailey again quote frankly when our first responders are being targeted when crime is going up double digits every year Californians deserve someone as attorney general is going to look at their problems\nYou're looking for a response is yes [laughter]\nWell ah last week I announced with the uh the sheriff's down in Southern California that we had done another I'm a takedown of a gang that was infecting our communities uh we've done some seven a if not about eight a gang take down in the\nPast year or so throughout the state to try to help make our community safe or\nWe're going after sex traffickers work targeting mostly our young girls who are under age\nAnd selling them for sex or we have gone after people who have fraudulently are taking money from the hands of America or California consumers sitting here talking about getting some new tools through the Senate for sex trafficking and we got them we are waiting justified or before the U.S Senate\nLast year to so that state prosecutors like me would have the power to go after sex traffickers which the courts were given it's a tough time\nGetting that done or the Senate and house agreed and now I I can go after these guys we we took down the largest uh\nEssentially a bomb I ... in in the world are back page dot com and uh we hope to be able to do that more aggressively now that we have the tools because we went after them and we got them on things unrelated to the sex trafficking we got to conspiracy we got them on money laundering\nThe charges on sex trafficking are the ones that got dismissed so now will be able to go after them on those sex trafficking charges as well so we're doing everything we can of public safety to help uh keep people safe but uh I Would say to my anyone whether it's my opponent anyone else who thinks that California is going to just a a\nPut down its guard I've fallen forty four lawsuits against Donald Trump every single one of them is still alive not one of them has been thrown as being frivolous and I've had nothing but successes in those lawsuits and so if a my opponent wants to disarm California\nAnd keep it from being the number one creator of jobs in the in the U.S and he's he's welcome to do so but I'm going to fight tooth and nail for the things that keep our people\nOur values and our resources a number one we're going to\nInvite listeners to join us let me do that no no give you another quote from your opponent Steven Bailey and get your response to that but you can join us\nRight now like dialing in at eight six six seven three three six seven eight six we welcome your calls so please feel free if you have any questions or comments for attorney general how they are but Sarah who is running a you actually formerly congressman from the thirty fourth district in LA but now running\nTo succeed himself he was appointed by Jerry Brown of course to succeed come all the Harris you can join us also by emailing us for them at ... dot org or tweeting us our Twitter handles at kinky weedy form or going to our website kick you eat out or slash forum\nOther Bailey quote ready hey gee I'm right All right he says quote they told us that reducing drug and property crimes would make our streets and schools safer they mean presumably your office\nThey lied property cream crimes in our neighborhoods of sky rocketed but where she had drug addiction has resulted in the needless deaths of hundreds if not thousands of our citizens\nAnd children I think that that they refer to someone other than my office but I I think what I understand what he's trying to say which is wrong he's he's he should site facts\nAre accurately by talking about the Sacramento politicians meaning your fellow Democrats and I think he's talking about the move to try to um allow low level offenders who have committed violent crimes to\nAh serve their time doing service in the community versus become hardened criminals while they spend a year or two or three in in the state penitentiary so trying to reduce the number of people that we sent into our state penitentiaries\nA by taking those who have not committed the most violent or serious crimes are out of the system and actually putting them into a system that lets them\nReintegrate because at the end of the day even these hardened criminals almost all of them end up out back on the streets and I guarantee you the the last thing you learn in a state penitentiary has had to reintegrate into society so I'm the effort has been underway for now some\nClose to eight or so years to try to move away from just incarcerating our way out of a problem and I think it's a good idea to try to re incorporate offenders who have done only low level crimes if we can but the problem is you've got to make sure the resources\nFollow the individual into the community so that the services are provided if you don't then chances are you will see a cycle of of criminal activity reoccurring and that's what you want to stop and so you got to the resources follow the individual to get that person a re integrated into society\nWill hear from Mr Bailey and the course of a time before the election but he wants to reverse a that voter initiative to make a drug possession and property crime misdemeanors and feels that that's putting too many people on the street that shouldn't be on the street and you say went to the\nWell that those are the days when you if you had a an ounce of marijuana you went to a state prison or serve a long time and then when you came out not only did you buy an ounce of marijuana but you probably became a dealer and who knows what else and\nWhat we try to do is avoid getting the person who committed a low lower level drug events from becoming a hardened criminal who ends up doing for more than just buying an ounce of marijuana which today of course is no longer a crime and so I I think what we're trying to do is move California way from thinking it could have cars rate\nIts way out of a of a problem and ah right now what I think we're seeing is that there is an effort by California the people California voted for the measures to fail killer let's try this let's see if young young offenders who have committed serious violent crimes can can write themselves and let's help them by providing the resources\nDon't have enough money to bail yourself out or what should keep you detained prior to any guilty verdict\nIs Europe your danger to the public not dollars in your pocket and we had a system that depended on money on bail based on money to determine whether or not you should be allowed free you can be rich and dangerous and be on the streets under money bill\nYou could be poor and not a danger and still be stuck in prison that doesn't make sense\nWe're going to go to your calls for the attorney general and legal first Tamil valley will commute Joan Hi\nHi good morning I'm\nI really love the program I'm so thankful\nFor her I'm not sure that they're being there for our country as the attorney general for California one of the only

question um I I think you're beginning to see a change in the way we handle these cases nationwide or in Chicago there was a recent guilty verdict against a police officer\nWho shot and killed a young African American man a and while the case took several years finally to get a ... it did ah I my sense is that\nWith the technology making it possible for us to see and know more about these incidents are now our law enforcement agencies are trying to become more transparency more transparency are the more we'll be able to ensure that we weed out the bad apples are right now are speaking of San
