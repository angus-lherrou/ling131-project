we're joined now by the candidates for the fourth us congressional district which is centered in California gold country Republican incumbent Tom McClintock has a reputation as an anti tax and limited government conservative\nThe American Conservative Union rates and the client talk as the state's most conservative congressman\nFirst time candidate Jessica Morse in northern California native has worked for us a id in Iraq and later at the state department she prioritizes issues such as fire prevention policy and protection of public lands welcome so much Jessica Mars and Tom McClintock next we're having a great to be here\nSo um let's start with you a congressman McClintock just tell us why are you running for reelection\nMotor continue the work that I've been in bark done in the Congress to reduce the burdens or to taxes and regulations have placed on the economy we've made enormous progress in Washington the last couple of years doing that and we're seeing a remarkable economic expansion as a result\nUh meanwhile I chair the federal lands says subcommittee of natural resources are where we have been putting a lot of attention into a restoring our forest health\nOr we're dealing with laws that have made the ... of scientific management of our force all but impossible and we're now seeing a the Sierra carrying three and four times the timber density that the land can support in that crowded condition\n[noise] our trees are no longer a are able to sustain natural stresses like drought that disease pests joins enrollment consumed by catastrophic wildfire that work is very important as is the work we're doing on the budget to restore our national economy and the prosperity that if the shores\nAnd it's more it's what about you why are you running\nYou know our community deserves a partner and an advocate to break down barriers and bring resources back to our district and actually fight for the real challenges and solutions that challenges that the real people in our community face\nOff in our political system has become hyper partisan and congressman McClintock is an example of somebody who lives with his party over Ninety five percent of the time that those consistently against our community and this is my home community you know my family's five generations from the Sierra we still have the original homestead land and I grew up serving our ... our country all over the world\nAnd whether I was serving in Iraq or with the state department in India I always knew that when I was working for a Republican president or a Democratic president I was working for the American people\nAnd right now our community deserves somebody who will work for us whether that's improving our health care and making sure that our economies are thriving and that kids are getting trained for the jobs that are demanding here improving our forest health and actively working on creating jobs by improving our environment\nAnd you both mentioned at the forest and the Sierra um as you probably know a new un report issued today finds that the worst effects of climate change will actually be felt in the coming decades or in California some say we're already seeing the effects with these wildfires\nUm congressman McClintock I'll start with you what is your take on climate change leading to a bigger fires and what are some of the state steps that the federal government could possibly take to mitigate some of these fires\nBut I Know this uh there was absolutely no corroborating evidence to her accusations any of the other accusations which were grotesque and nature are leveled at a judge Kevin\nI'm that is you know ... one of the most fundamental principles of justice in our society is you cannot make accusations without evidence that is what\nAre what happened during the ... the Senate confirmation vote\nBut could you argue this was not a trial this was essentially a job interview\nThere's principles of justice are exactly the same I cannot accuse you of some heinous bio grotesque act right here on this program is not a trial\nWithout offering evidence if I did that you would have a right to sue me for a for slander for defamation uh and if I did and under oath or a that's a crime a that is prosecuted all um that is\nWhat we were encountering with it is and I think the reaction of the American people are has has been very decidedly against the circus that some Democrats created or when they um made these charges with absolutely no evidence behind them\nMs ... what about you would you have ... I had you been in the Senate voted to confirm justice capping off\nI think it's been an emotional week for everyone and um I Want to address like congressman and I was just talking about which is\nThe standard for survivors in our society and I think a lot of women this week felt um that our government was failing and when one in three women\nWill experiences sexual assault in their lifetime that sixty percent of those itself will go unreported the question was should be asking isn't\nWhat's wrong with the when the question we should be asking is what is wrong with our system and what is wrong with our system if we have elected officials like congressman McClintock who will he came out this week and said the doctor for the testimony was crazy talk\nAnd he voted against the violence against women act on every level he's voted to make women less safe and and to penalize survivors for coming forward and what we need to do is get people in office you will stand up for every member of our society so that when they can feel safe and what I Will do in Congress because that's what I can impact\nIs to ensure that we remove the statute of limitation on sexual assault that we Institute universal rape kit testing so that we can apprehend serial rapists and how to see and I have a database to make sure we can prosecute them\nAnd then we also need to be making sure that there is consent education so that we address the culture at its core and that we don't have a week like this again and we can move forward with women feeling safe in our society what I think\nJust heard Jessica say is a a a a system of of principles of justice and which accusation is the same as conviction\nUh I don't think most people would recognize that as a fair or just society with respect to the violence against women act I laid out my principles very clearly when I voted against it in my principal concern is that that made it possible for a United States citizen who has absolutely no connection to an Indian tribe\nA is accused of a crime on a reservation land to be tried not in a U.S court but in a tribal court\nOf of that also steps across a very bright line\nAlso the mandatory provisions involved well we're actually opposed by several women's organizations not the least of which the eagle four and a conservative women's form because they recognize that these mandated a that leaves mandates upon justices or a judge is\nA a would often lead to unjust actions fact prior to the boat on boa\nOr there was a a case in Florida where a woman\nPrior to the boat on boa or there was a case in Florida where a woman was sentenced to something like Twenty years for taking a warning shot at her abusive husband the judge protested that he had absolutely no choice because he was bound by these mandates those mandates of Melbourne placed them in and we'll\nMiss more I'm getting back do you think that justice Kevin ... should have been confirmed\nI Believe this is a hyper partisan process that actually did a disgrace to our constitution\nWhat we saw play out um was what is supposed to be nonpartisan seat that is supposed to be a lifetime appointment our Supreme Court is supposed to be above party politics and it's supposed to be the protectors of our constitution we always want someone in that seat who is going to be calm\nEven minded fair and non partisan and justice Kavanaugh demonstrated that he didn't fit\nI'm that those qualifications I think there are a lot of justices um that would have that we could have confirmed and yet this was pushed forward um requiring only fifty percent I'm only fifty votes as opposed to what was the historic hatred of sixty\nVotes within the Senate and say well we have deep based our Supreme Court and to be partisan process and I think that it's a shame for our constitution\nI don't remember adjusted for protesting when Harry Reid and the Democrats reduces sixty votes racial for a non US Supreme Court ah appointments [noise]\nUm we would like to invite our listeners to call in with your comments and questions if you live in the district what question do you have for these candidates you can give us a call at eight\nSix six seven three three six seven eight six that's eight six six seven three three six seven eight sex\nYou can also get in touch on Twitter and Facebook were at Cape Q.

[noise]\nI Do have a follow up for you congressman um ... you're talking about the the spending requests going up but the Republicans are in charge of the Senate and they are that Congress presidency I mean so how can how do you justify not if they go out are\nAbsolutely is no justification for that is why I've been opposing these massive spending increases would Jessica's been attacking before you want to know everything there is no about the budget and you know three numbers twenty six twenty nine or forty six\nTwenty six percent as the increase of inflation and population over the last ten years twenty nine percent is the increase in revenues in the same period our revenues have more than kept pace with inflation and population growth\nThe number of the killing us is that third number forty six percent\nThat the increase in spending in the same period of time\nIt is not sustainable is already starting to cause a debt spiral that this year is going to cost us about four hundred and Seventy five billion dollars a year\nJust in interest payments just reading the money we've already spent within the next several years that's going to take us to over seven hundred and fifty billion dollars a year that's more than we spend on the entire defense establishment and Jessica's only complaint is ah we're not spending it enough for fast enough\nUm it's more it's would you like to respond\nShort having worked on the federal budget firsthand I follow simple principles which is\nWe need to make sure that every tax dollar we spend has an investment that will pay off dividends for our community because often when we refuse to spend money on problems that are persisting we end up paying exponentially more due to pay for the the damages\nFor example wildfires a great example of that in California had to pay two point four billion dollars last\nThat's California had to pay two point four billion dollars last year and fire containment\nIt cost I was talking to Cal Fire chief in ... county cost about two thousand dollars to build a fire break outside of the animal column hill that saved it from the view fire\nYou know when we when we invest in fire prevention when we put money into force than in creating these jobs biomass facilities you know that can take forced waste and turn it into a job and create a system that will allow us to thin and and restore our force health will save\nWill save billions of dollars a year after year\nAnd so I agree that our national debt is is that a crisis point\nOver the next decade our national debt is is projected to actually surpassed our GDP and so we need to get it under control but allowing us to have to pay for disaster after disaster rather than actually making a wise investment and improving our economy improving our house\nAnd improving our environment and that will make our community safer and improve our local economy so that pays off dividends and allows our economy to grow\nYou know it's it's that's despite\nLiving let me let me explain why we cannot manage our forest proper ... right now because of laws that are in place of of the P. C. W. pleasure county water agency has a big watershed in the forest service land of they've got to keep it properly maintained they have no choice\nThey've got two million dollars of excess marketable timber but they're not gonna make two million dollars on that harvest is going to cost them eleven million dollars be cause of all of the permitting requirements are when you talk about fire breaks describes with the debt water command center of the day that the murder post there was a back you waited\nA their principal complaint was we know the condition of this force we know the topography we know how the fire was going to be have we been trying for years to get permits for the fire breaks so that we can put them in advance of a fire so that we we don't have to do that\nOf a ... in his lab dash matter during the fire they couldn't get the permits\nI Want to go to some callers now first we're going to go to Emily from Roosevelt Emily go ahead [noise] [noise]\nHi there are students and the district plan walk out and marches in the wake of mass shootings or earlier this year [noise] or when they went to Washington with a march for our lives congressman contact refused to meet with them\nI'd like to know how both candidates would represent our students that are scared to go to school and scared to be in the community\nWell first of all I didn't refused to meet with them or office met with them or I was not there at the time\nOr with respect to dealing with the uh these these mass shootings\nOr you know what what I find calling is you walk into any bank you'll see an armed guard there but you don't think anything of it that armed guard is there to protect our money and yet when it suggested that we should have armed guards on our campuses to ensure the safety of our children to lift goes absolutely ballistic\nWe have fifty years of experience with gun control laws they're extremely effective\nUh disarming law abiding citizens they're extremely ineffective uh disarming a criminals madman and terrorists of uh in order to secure our schools we have got to have good guys with guns prepared to stop bad guys with guns that's the only way you can you can secure a school is is to secure it uh with force\nJessica congressman McClintock had suggested arming teachers in his response after Parkland and\nAnd he said that every man woman and child needs to stand up and defend themselves I Lived in a place where everybody in armed it's called a war zone\nIf not safer and our children deserve to feel safe at school not to feel the trauma that I saw in war zones and I've been listening to our kids when they hear a book drop at school they hit the deck\nAnd because they are afraid and so we need to pies and and this has become a hyper partisan issue and it's not\nYou know I took an oath to the constitution I Love the second amendment and will protect every amendment and every element of our of our constitution I also grew up in a hunting family and I used to go duck hunting and fishing hunting with my dad all the time and I just went that target shooting when the uh\nWith the supervisors down in ... county and they're supporting me 'cause I'm a better shot than they are\nBut it's important that we have done safety as our priority and the gun safety standards that are Californian gun owners are already living under including universal background checks\nAnd um and ten day waiting period to purchase firearms\nOn end and ensuring that we're not selling um assault weapons to our community that doesn't turn that doesn't translate into anybody knocking on the door and taken away a gun which is the fear of many of our donors in California went that translates to is allowing our kids to be safer because we had a kid\nGo over to Nevada in a are Fifteen he showed up in Nineteen years old he was sending threats title went to high school or one of my cousins as a teacher\nAnd our Roosevelt police apprehended him and they found a loaded a are Fifteen in the back of his car we should not have weapons of war and the hands of\nHere and if they hadn't done that and he had showed up with that you are Fifteen on the campus there would have been nobody to stop him I've never suggested arming all teachers I did suggest that those teachers who have concealed weapons permits\nOr who have been and trusted by their local sheriff's a whisk carrying a concealed weapon should be allowed to do that on the campuses so that you've got folks who can with lethal force stop\nThe next attack and and I just don't understand why is it that that armed guards at our banks are are taking for granted\nBut but armed guards in our of a ... in our in our schools are a ... is a source of the wilderness to the left\nI'm not opposed to police officers and actual law enforcement officials um protecting our children when there is a threat or if we think there's a heightened concern for our community um I think our safety of our kids should be paramount the challenge I have and I think this comes when he never having into it\nHave and I think this comes when you never having into a war zone is that when people take direct fire you know\nYou have to have a great deal of training to be able to fire back accurately and\nWhat we're seeing is that when you're saying let's just give guns to teachers who have concealed carry permits and anybody who signed up for firearm they haven't gone to that level of training that are that are actual officials go through to be able to be responsible with a gun\nOn if there's a real safety situation and they won't be effective and so we need to have effective policies and I think that means ensuring that this the safety standards we already have here in California are brought across the kind of my\nMy I Want to get to it I Want to get to another call because we have a lot of people are calling in here we have a Christina from a course called Christina please go ahead\n[laughter] I guess I'm or quite that's more\nUm I'd like to ask her about last week you attended a public school\nWhere students were mandated to attend the talk from now during your talk it would turn into a campaign by asking the children are raised their hand it they would vote for you and if they went out their hair to vote for you\nUm then after that\nIt was chosen for that you put the pictures of the children on all your campaign fight without the permission from the parents do you have an ethical\nAnd then became a campaign fight 'em an of an event that you pay for the facility [noise]\nWe were invited by one of the students and this was part of her senior project and so we are taking direction from the school and the standard than when we got feedback from the parents we responded immediately and so I'm so sorry if I'm your children ... felt pressured to be there I Know these same kids also heard from congressman McClintock over the years\nAnd also from other candidates coming through and so I Know this has been a practice\nOf the school and I was really honored to have the opportunity to hear the question of the kids and to really listen to\nThem there you go again I have often addressed a public school students but always about constitutional principles and never as a campaign stop in fact the school officials have always been an explicit\nOf a no partisan politics this is not a campaign stop of a we want to hear your of or perspective on constitutional principles as we teach our children these principles are so so suggests there's some sort of equivalents I I think is again just another misrepresentation\nYou're listening to farm here on member supported ... San Francisco or on ... north island Sacramento the time is now ten o'clock\nThis was a special edition of ... forum a debate in the race for governor between Gavin Newsom and John Cox I'm Scott Shafer ... senior editor for politics and government knew some the Democrat is promising bold action to help families and children and he's pledging to continue California's role opposing the Trump Administration\nVoters will have a real show I saw this November between a governor who's going to stand up to Donald Trump in a foot soldier in his war on California\nBut Republican businessman John Cox is government spending is out of control with regulations and the high cost of living pricing people out of California and he says don't blame Republicans\nWasn't Donald Trump who may California the highest tax day and the country it was gap and no matter what John\nCox and Gavin Newsom one of them will be the next governor they're both here to share their vision for the state will get started right now\nAnd welcome to the special edition of cake UDs form a debate about the future of California and who should be the next governor with John Cox and Gavin Newsom\nI'm Scott Shafer cake UT senior editor for politics and government and before we hear from the candidates I just wanted to let everyone know that this will not be a formal debate with the exact same questions to each candidate and strict time limits for answers that kind of thing and said it's going to be more of a wide ranging conversation\nWith lots of give and take and hopefully by the end you'll have a better sense of who these two candidates are and what kind of governor they'd be so let's get started\nRepublican John Cox is a businessman who lives in rancho Santa Fe and San Diego Mr Cox welcome thank you for having me\nAnd Democrat Gavin Newsom as in ten of governor and former mayor of San Francisco Mr Newsom welcome to you as well great to be here thanks for having a while we flip the coin to see who's going to go first and so we're going to begin with you Mr new some um and the same question will be to you afterwards Mr ... what's your vision for California and how do you think it's different from the other guy and I'm gonna ask you keep it relatively short [laughter]\nWell I think at the end of the day we're all better off we're all better off and so any vision has to be an inclusive vision the commonwealth\nThe fact is the issue that defines all other issues from my perspective in this state is the issue of wealth disparity in income inequality issue of social mobility the California Dream\nIt's an interesting fact they're only two dreams the American dream and the California Dream there no Iowa dream New Hampshire dream right there is no Nevada dream but the California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poor state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd we're going to get to many of those issues in just a moment Mr Cox uh what's your vision\nWell my vision of California's where people can afford to buy a house or or pay rent that's affordable uh they they can afford gasoline they can afford water electricity\nThey can send their children to a school that's not failing that's not near the bottom or they don't have to live in fear of fires uh they they don't have to see a homeless all over the street or\nYou know a Gavin spent part of the political class that has led the state downward I I have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento or the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving a I represent change or we're going to start talking about reforming a are broken political system day one when I'm the governor\nAll right and we're going to talk about uh many of those things but both of you mentioned affordability so let's talk about housing I think everybody agrees there is a housing crisis in California just not enough supply to meet demand and what's out there is either on affordable to buy or in many cases to rent\nAnd California is also almost dead last in housing construction or capital I think Utah is fifty were forty nine\nAnd there are a lot of reasons for that uh but I'm Wondering do you think and I'll start with you Mr Cox uh do you think that there's too much local control when it comes to housing that enables whether it's local governments or interest groups to kill housing or slow it down so that it ends up costing too much my\nFirst of all I'm In the housing business I started at Thirty years ago when I built apartments for a living I can build apartments in other states that I operate in for a fourth or fifth\nOf what they cost a built in California and the reason this red tape taxes lawsuits ah approval process is that take forever to be clear you've\nBeen building in other states right in ... Illinois and it's\nAnd it's government that has driven up the cost of housing in California now we have to exercise leadership from Sacramento and I will certainly do that because we do need to build a lot of housing but we need to build the that housing in a cost effective way lower costs now I I certainly want local\nCost effective way with lower costs now I I certainly want local authorities to be involved in the process and they have to be involved in the process I've sat on local ... in the past\nAnd do they have too much power now you know I I I don't think they do know ah I think they should have power uh but I think there is also can be leadership that's exercise in the top of one of the things that I Would do is reform sequels which has been turned into an effort by trial lawyers to suit competitors and stopped development and that's limited and the supply of housing\nThat's the California environmental quality I absolutely cyanide with Ronald Reagan actually I think in Nineteen Seventy some what about you housing\nYou know look at it you're right we're forty nine out of fifty of them per capita housing units and you're correct Utah's the only state producing less housing\nAnd the fact is we're producing about a hundred thousand plus or minus housing units on an annual basis in order to create some price equilibrium in this state a from a production perspective we bought a developing close to four times that number so you're right it is a issue of production but it's also an issue of intention allergy or lack there are\nThere are no state wide housing goals in California and new timelines no object is no strategy to organize at the local level the kind of determination to address this legitimate affordability crisis as it relates to your question about local is yes local is I mean it's determinative\nBut there's a certain point where the nimby ism a there's a certain point with a lack of focus in terms of producing a the requisite housing that's required in this day\nThere's a certain point where the state of California it needs to intervene how incentivize good behavior or disincentive eyes bad behavior one of the specific plans of the Fifteen specific plans we have to address this housing crisis comes to the issue of allocation of tax revenue\nMayors have a perverse disincentives for housing mayors actually have an incentive for\nBig box retail mayors collect cities collect\nRetail sales tax they don't collect property tax we would like to have that debate about re allocating that tax you guys talking about reforming prop Thirteen were talking about attacks conversation around this housing conversation process you know on the table that everything's on the table as it relates to this issue this is the issue\nThat defines the affordability crisis number two\nI think you also have to be a punitive\nAs it relates to the local government I think one of the proposals that to me is most interesting and intriguing actually comes from this region the MTC metropolitan transit a commission is talking about utilizing their ability to take discretionary transit dollars in allocate those trends of dollars to municipalities that are meeting\nTheir housing production goals and taking those dollars away from those that are not that's just too specific examples of how we can address distracts\nYou grab your yeah your major league was one of ...\nBut I didn't hear any of that by the way and Yemen's been in office for sixteen years here in California and he's not\nYou know done much about this problem as it's gotten worse and worse and worse\nAh we've got to bring down the cost of housing and it's not enough just to apply incentives and disincentives well we also have to do is make sure that we shorten the approval frame we uh we got to make sure that we uh how do you do this while I think we we work with local authorities frankly to to uh basically modify a lot of the state laws\nThat are making the process longer and longer and longer it takes twelve Fifteen Years I can build in Indiana and I can get approvals within six months or other states that have Democrat governors can build housing in a lot faster a lot less costly than California\nUh I you know failed to believe that we can't build housing that's what more cost effective and available for people\n... that just because it's important point on sequence in the past John has argued for eliminating sequence\nReforming had called for its eliminate I specifically I said to eliminate it and replace it with something that's more workable in so I Believe in more categorical exceptions for socially desirable projects for ... excuse the walking is around is more programmatic\nEnvironmental impact report to address the issue of pre development risk I Do believe\nThe issue of time value of money in essence what John is getting at is an important part of the solution is well again that's why there's no one single strategy that's going to address this issue that's why we've laid out fifty and I hope we can compare and contrast to listeners compare and contrast our proposals are specific\nTangible plans because there is a profound contrast in the\nJunior high I have a lot of specific plans and of course those plans don't mean anything unless you're willing to go up against the special interest and\nYou know let me know what those these are interest groups that benefit we're going or environmental groups that fund or the legislature as well as fund a Gavin campaign uh we've got to take that money out of that a ... you know out of that game and we've got to make sure that we change the status quo I'm\nAnd by Comcast for today's students are home Internet connection is more central than ever Internet essential is from Comcast disconnected over six million low income Americans to high speed Internet at home giving every student the opportunity to succeed\n\nAnd welcome back to ... we're talking with John Cox the Republican candidate for governor and Gavin Newsom the Democrat let's switch topics and talking about criminal justice a last month a Governor Brown signed a couple of bills giving the public\nUh under certain conditions more access to police personnel records and the video from police body cameras ... would you have signed either of those ...\nNo I wouldn't have and uh let me tell you I think we have a serious crime problem right here in the city now San Francisco is the number one city for property crimes and\nYou know Gavin was mayor here for eight years or he didn't solve the homeless problem here at all and it's gotten worse and now a and not only that but Gavin was also the only statewide official to endorse prop forty seven which redefined a lot of felonies as misdemeanors\nAnd I'll give him a chance to see what we're talking about transparency those bills or specifically about transparency I've told me why you wouldn't have\nI favor transparency I certainly favorite transparency uh but I think we have to work more with our law enforcement and give them the tools and the ability to deal with a a you know this particular situation is I I regret the Gulf between the police and\nYou know uh you know people in the neighborhoods I think there has to be a lot more communication I think we have to foster that but but going after the police and are opening up a you know private personnel records I think is is a you know it's just a kind of creates a fishing expedition for a trial lawyers\nI don't know how you can be pro transparency and oppose that bill\nA twenty seven states provide quote unquote some access to those records or what we did is reconcile that\nAnd it was a lot of compromise was a lot of work with law enforcement uh before I got on the governor's desk to the governor's credit he let a lot of those efforts to find common ground and compromise it's about transparency it's also about trust\nA and I'm someone who believes very passionately are in very enthusiastically very supportive of the men and women in uniform same time you could be pro public safety and pro civil rights are and due process and I think uh we found a nice balance with the legislation the governor signed\nAnother another question on this topic up past governors at virtually every other governor except Jerry Brown ... has have reversed parole recommendations for most people who have come up for parole when they're serving life sentences with the possibility of parole Governor Brown has gone the other direction you glad about eighty percent\nOf those ... recommendations to go forward into let those uh felons out on a onto a probation or out on the streets um would you do that ... would you what would you go back to the way it was or do you think that the governor this governor's doing the right to do I think\nWe have to be very tough ah you know I I lament the fact that our criminal justice system is letting you know so many people are and doing plea bargains out or to let people out on that\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or freedom theater at ... dot com\nYeah he had this guy had a wrap sheet as long as my arm but folks\nWho have been recommended for parole by the probe already saying maybe you would why are they going to a person to\nHave no I Would look at I Would look at those judiciously of course and evaluate those on the facts and and the circumstances I mean I certainly\nBelieve in a a restoration I'm I'm On the board of a a restore the justice mediation project in San Diego so I Do believe in reconciliation but you know and and rehabilitation uh but I Want to make sure that the public is protected on each of the situation so I'll be I'll be pretty\nTough I Know you're you're also Catholic you've spoken about your Catholic great both of your cat how does that figure into I remember talking to the governor about it and he talked about redemption uh and that's one of the reasons he was giving these folks have different second chance\nI mean I I Do believe in redemption I I really do a I think uh someone who has committed a crime that's why\nThis restored of justice project is so important because it reconciled people offenders with their victims to make them understand what the hurt is their victims but I think we ought to the public to make sure that we applied parole judiciously and uh and that we have a a good set of eyes looking at this to make sure the value of well I think we do have a\nGood set of eyes and we've had a good governance done the right thing I what I'm trying to reconcile John's answer is he says he would not uh continue a I think Neal lightened a sense to policies have Governor Brown a which has been about restoration has been about second chances has been in the spirit of what John was advancing I Would like to build on that\nI also like to build on governor Brown's criminal justice reform legacy and I've been a lot of I think very enlightened reforms kept the ideological about these reforms you've got to be open to argument interested in evidence has a relates to changing conditions if you think the jury trial out on whether they bought all ... all of these things you have to be interactive\nA profit fifty seven which is about to be implemented forty seven three strikes a bee winner nine which was ... you cannot be ideological or the fundamental responsibility of a governor any chief executive is public safety so that's always top of mind\nBut just locking folks up uh being quote unquote tough on crime I don't think it's necessarily the answer and that's the old saw I think being smart on crime or and I think the example of the last few years is at an example of that I I think is a much more enlightened approach and I want to build on that approach is coming\nFrom forty seven as as widely eggs knowledge now that have been a real problem rather owners who don't know we should say every\nGallon measure that a downgrade it a lot of mostly drug crimes too from felonies to Mr\nMann you talked to a lot of small retailers and they're finding that this is really creating problems for them and\nYou know a Gavin wants to continue governor Brown's a management or or or even worse and the fact of the matter is under Governor Brown people are further being priced out of the state they're leaving the state or in droves a\nA R schools we've spent eighty percent more I Hope we talk about education because we've vastly increased spending for our schools and they're now in the bottom you know ...\nTen percent of of the states and that's just not a situation that I Would want to continue and\nWe just had bail reform signed by the governor and that's going to take effect ah next year and a um I'm Wondering\nYou know all the judges are going to get a lot more discretion or because of that and there are some people feel both sides of that where that's a good idea or not but the other thing Governor Brown is he's really diversified the bench not just in terms of race and ethnicity but backgrounds he's appointed a lot of public defenders\nAnd a lot of defense attorneys in public interest attorneys is that it is that a trend you would continue or would you\nGo for Iran having a balance is a good thing but this bail reform was not a good thing I mean what you're doing is replacing a private business with a\n... a lot more state workers and ah and that's really who uh who lobbied to get this done or why would it be more state workers well because you're going to have a lot more people that are gonna have to go out now and bring people in and make sure that they appear for a further trials and that's a that's a real issue and it and it limits and industry\nYou know listen this is all part of the same piece and that is that we have to make sure that the people are protected and it's not just rhetoric it's actual performance\nYou know let's talk about a battle reform only do tear taste Philippines and Trump's United States of America have money about California became the first state to step up and step into this debate and do the right thing\nOr is insidious from my humble perspective African Americans and Latinos are being incarcerated disproportionately for one reason the size of their ATM their bank balance not the likelihood that they'll actually commit a crime before their crimes are officially due to cater to dispel reform was an extraordinary step\nForward or in a civil rights a effort not just a criminal justice reform I applaud the governor applaud the legislature for their enlightened leadership and by the way in terms of\nMoving forward at one has to be yes very cautious about its application and implementation as it relates that judicial oversight and that is an expression of legitimate concern in the next governor will have to advance that concern by being very attentive to the implementation of that before and\nWe're not taking life calls on the show but we did through social media or solicit some questions and we got one now sort of related to this topic of criminal justice let's listen\nTo my name is Michelle and I think many and um I Would like to answer how they are going to handle them than I Am\nMr Cox gun violence\nWell you know one thing we need to do is stop publicize the names are and pictures of these perpetrators of these gun crimes are a lot of 'em are mentally ill at you know you almost have to be mentally ill to take another person's life or the way that things have happened [noise]\nUh I think California's done a lot uh to keep guns out of the hands of people that are mentally deranged uh certainly be interested to look at more ways to to keep guns out of what would you have all these things you know I don't know uh but uh I think we've done a lot of ready ah I think what we need\nYou know I don't know uh but uh I think we've done a lot of ready a I think what we need to do is we need to treat mental illness or we need to make sure that\nPeople uh you know who do commit these crimes that don't have their names and pictures publicized I think that's a mental illness as well as they got control is is useful or not well you know criminals don't care about gun control I mean they they they'll break the law that's why they're criminals or you know the more laws are not going to do the job [noise]\nUh I certainly favor keeping guns out of the hands of people who are dangerous\nPeople who are mentally ill and uh but you know the second amendment is an important amendment\n... let's let's be honest with you at Johns record he said gun safety laws are quote unquote a waste of time he pries himself in a lifetime member of the national Rifle Association doesn't believe in wait times ah and has been a strong advocate for concealed weapons concealed carry legislation\nGavin Newsom and Republican John Cox [noise]\n\nAnd we continue our conversation with the candidates for governor John Cox and Gavin Newsom I Want to say that uh before today or we reached out to a lot of reporters that we respect from places like the LA Times Cal matters San Francisco chronicle a political when our public radio partners and we got their suggestions for\nQuestions and topics and a lot of the questions you're hearing today a reflection of their inputs I Want to thank them for that\nThis question comes from one of our listeners let's listen\nHi my name is Maria I lived in last Daniel California my question to both of the ... yeah ... well they do to resolve the issue of our social every boat or folks you every city could deal with the logo or problems that\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or for him theater at ... dot com\nI think we need to have law enforcement work together to make sure the public to say I'm I've talked to a sheriff's all over the state who have told me that the sanctuary state law is an impediment\nOr to their ability to police uh their communities and to make sure that criminal activity is reduced uh they tell me that they get information and uh and they have a information about gang activity about people who are engaged in in drug dealing and other kinds of\nThings and how does the century last stop them from pursuing them because\nIf they know that they're here illegally they can't inform ice until they actually go through and get a conviction under a lot of issues that are putting into the sanctuary state law uh I think if somebody's here illegally and they're in the Asian criminal activity\nI think it's up to our public officials to to to to kick them out uh I I don't want my family to have their papers checked everywhere they are I don't want any family in California to have that we should be checking papers at the border not a yard or not in the classroom or\nYou know you get rid of a century law that I Would get rid of the ... well\nI think we need to get the legislature to do that and and if they don't do it I think we need to get it to vote or the people at this this law I think is very unpopular uh I think it sends the wrong message a I think people want to know that they're going to have their law enforcement officials worked together\nHere is that one of the ... points in contrast between myself and John Cox uh he's someone who believes very passionately and building the wall or he believes in sex or a policy should be eliminated he believes in the elimination as he refers to the chain migration which is nothing more than family reunification ... parents in almost every\nDonald Trump Trump ism and drop would have an advocate in Sacramento if he becomes the next governor as it relates to the issue of immigration here are the facts and with respect to the question I Hope the listener or has the benefit of listening to this and that is fundamentally\nA the immigrants of the state are under not over under represented in the criminal justice system\nThe fact is sexually counties are not more violent more dangerous than non sanctuary cities and counties quite the contrary sanctuary policies nothing more than this is about community policing it's about building trust a victim of crime or a witness a crime is more likely to come forward if they're not worried\nAbout local law enforcement being an arm of federal ... immigration deportation they're more likely to get their child educated drop them off at school they're not worried about a school crossing guard being part of that immigration arm accordingly they're more likely this time of year flu season to get an immunization shot and to be healthier\nAnd they're not worried about the nurse or turning them over I fear under a Cox administration working hand in glove with Donald Trump\nOr that our policies are progressive in in light and policies on immigration I Will roll back into the dark ages\nMr got you once said I think that you would arrest CEOs that hired undocumented immigrants is that does that reflect you know I think they need to\nMake sure that we provide a guest worker program and other avenues for people but yeah I think we should not be hiring people who have broken the lawn and cutting line will make a holiday I think a lot of workers I don't know\nUh when we would need to to to determine that but I think every country has a right to the tremendous borders and unfortunately the country to the south of us have twenty six thousand murders last year\nUh I don't want to see drugs guns and human trafficking come across that border and I think\nYou know a border wall is a necessary I live in San Diego and it's had some effect there but\nThe other Republican mayor of San Diego opposes the war\nMaybe so but you know it it uh a lot of people you know I think it's the right thing to do a you know uh having said that I'm not in favor of checking papers in classrooms are on people's yards and going around and taking people out who are obeying the law what about ice and ... I I Want to make sure\nThat if somebody is in involved in criminal activity that hit their he'll illegally they should be removed from the state\nYou know somebody who said it's about the wall to wall it's a monument to stupidity\nOn the wall is intended to divide this country ah John may be familiar with this I Hope others are as well forty percent of people here without documentation came here because they overstay their visa many flu\nOr this notion of a sixth century solution to twenty first century ... problem is ludicrous from my perspective\nAs it relates to sanctuary there certainly should be sanctuary\nWhen people are accessing the court system and I subscribe to a point of view that's aligned with the vast majority of judges that believe that should be neutral territory and I should not be coming in rating our court system where people are trying to access justice for participating in the justice system\nWhen you were there and I know you remember this there was a terrible murder of a father and I think two sons have committed to live in a committed by somebody was here illegally I had been in the juvenile justice system and that was not a turned over to the police are and I wonder are you know you've been implemented a policy to turnover juveniles accused of crimes before they were convicted was that a mistake\nYeah due process I mean the fact is if I had that to do over again the issue of due process was the missing link there the the point is essentially policy is not\nA shield for criminal activity no one is suggesting somehow John implied that people have the right to unfettered or violence in the state regardless of their immigration status they need to be held to account the question is due process and so the Internet for quality of these\nTo account the question is due process and so the quality of these laws require some objectivity not an ideological prism that's why Governor Brown has an example amended the sanctuary law that he was in ... that he was handed a with eight hundred specific\nConditions where we can coordinate and collaborate with ice along the lines of some of the mistakes and lessons were learned from\nOne of those conditions was that the state prisons were exempted from now that legislation would you change that I should prisons be part of it\nI I think I I I stand by what the governor did today but I'm open to argument as new evidence and new conditions present themselves [noise]\nAll right let's talk about a timely topic a climate change uh today is the one year anniversary of the wildfires up in ah the north bay dozens of people killed thousands of structures are destroyed homes and there's a new report out today from the United nations on climate change a saying that these\nTerrible changes to climate or coming more quickly than we thought and they say you can't really be addressed without\nEven like getting rid of coal altogether and so I'm Wondering you know California has taken a lot of steps or do you agree with those what additional steps on Mr Cox do you think it has to take her what were some of the mistakes we've made so far in an acting somebody's going to Burma policy well\nI'm not an idiot log on this uh uh I'm I'm a problem solver and I'm also not a climatologist upsetting to pass but I'm not a but I'll certainly listen to climatologists on this I Believe the earth is getting warmer and humans may well have a a an effect on to\nA and I want the air as clean as possible I drive an electric car I'm proud of that\nAh the point is that a are we getting enough of an impact on the world's a atmosphere or to justify the cost to the people the state India and China are dumping tons of carbon in the ad\nWas here they've also signed onto the Paris Agreement which they should because there there we pull out or as\nWell but what we're doing a lot we've done a lot in California to clean the air frankly the politicians are like you haven't you know have failed miserably or to police the uh the forest in and take care of the forest and managed to for us\nThe carbon that was released a by the fires and it's it's a one year anniversary of those fires\nThe carbon released by those fires uh was you know ... comprised months of carbon from cars and trucks that were working to try to\nReduce so having a round just signed sb one hundred which requires the state by twenty forty five to get all of its energy from clean sources would you sign up\nWith no because what we're going to do that is we're going to double electricity prices a worthy goal it's wonderful lofty goal to have I I certainly want the ear to be clean\nA but we're going to keep pounding people this state into poverty electricity prices in the states are already almost twice what Texas pays a the hundred percent renewable is a wonderful goal but it's also going to drive people further into poverty we can't keep doing it to the people the state so\nJohn Cox uh ... celebrate or at least acknowledged a enthusiastically that Donald Trump or did the right thing when he pulled out of Paris I reject that and I applaud the leadership in the state of California
