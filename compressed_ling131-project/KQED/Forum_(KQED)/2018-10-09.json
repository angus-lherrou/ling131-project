{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KQED", "content": "Stay with us for the a ... a debate that aired earlier today with John Cox and Gavin Newsom that starting next\nOn [noise]\n... San Francisco ... Sacramento it's ten o'clock\nThis is a special edition of ... forum a debate in the race for governor between Gavin Newsom and John Cox I'm Scott Shafer ... senior editor for politics and government knew some the Democrat is promising bold action to help families and children and he's pledging to continue California's role opposing the Trump Administration voters will\nHave a real choice is November between the governor has got to stand up to Donald Trump in a foot soldier his war\nOn California but Republican businessman John Cox is government spending is out of control with regulations on the high cost of living pricing people out of California and he says I don't blame Republicans\nIt wasn't Donald Trump who may California the highest hack state and the country it was\nCabin John Cox and Gavin Newsom one of them will be the next governor they're both here to share their vision for the state will get started right now and welcome\nTo the special edition of cake UDs form a debate about the future of California and who should be the next governor with John Cox and Gavin Newsom\nI'm Scott Shafer kick you the senior editor for politics and government and before we hear from the candidates I just wanted to let everyone know that this will not be a formal debate with the exact same questions to each candidate and strict time limits for answers that kind of thing and said it's going to be more of a wide ranging conversation\nWith lots of give and take and hopefully by the end you'll have a better sense of who these two candidates are and what kind of governor they'd be so let's get started\nRepublican John Cox is a businessman who lives in rancho Santa Fe and San Diego Mr Cox welcome thank you for having me\nAnd Democrat Gavin Newsom as in ten of governor and former mayor of San Francisco Mr Newsom welcome to you as well great to be here thanks for having a while we flip the coin to see who is going to go first and so we're going to begin with you Mr knew some of the same question will be to you afterwards Mr Cox what's your vision for California and how do you think it's different from the other guy and I'm going to ask you keep it relatively short [laughter]\nWell I think at the end of the day we're all better off we're all better off and so any vision has to be an inclusive vision the commonwealth\nThe fact is the issue that defines all other issues from my perspective in this state is the issue of wealth disparity in income inequality issue of social mobility the California Dream\nIt's an interesting fact there are only two dreams the American dream and the California Dream there's no Iowa dream New Hampshire dream or there is no Nevada dream but the California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd we're going to get to many of those issues in just a moment Mr Cox uh what's your vision\nWell my vision of California's where people can afford to buy a house or or pay rent that's affordable or they they can afford gasoline they can afford water electricity\nThey can send their children to a school that's not failing that's not near the bottom or they don't have to live in fear of fires uh they they don't have to see a homeless all over the street or\nYou know a Gavin has been part of the political class that has led the state down where I have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento or the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving a I represent change or we're going to start talking about reforming a are broken political system day one went under governor\nAll right and we're going to talk about uh many of those things but both of you mentioned affordability so let's talk about housing I think everybody agrees there is a housing crisis in California just not enough supply to meet demand and what's out there is either on affordable to buy or in many cases to rent\nAnd California is also almost dead last in housing construction or capital to Utah is fifty were forty nine and there are a lot of reasons for that uh but I'm Wondering\nDo you think and I'll start with you Mr Cox uh do you think that there's too much local control when it comes to housing that enables whether it's local governments or interest groups to kill housing or slow it down so that it ends up costing too much money\nFirst of all I'm In the housing business I started at Thirty years ago when I built apartments for a living I can build apartments in other states that I operated in for a fourth or fifth\nOf what they cost a built in California and the reason this red tape taxes lawsuits a approval process is that take forever\nTo have been building in other states right in ... Illinois and it's\nIt's government that has driven up the cost of housing in California now we have to exercise leadership from Sacramento and I will certainly do that because we\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the patron or freedom theater at ... dot com\nTo be involved in the process and they have to be involved in the process I've sat on local ... only ... in the past\nAnd do they have too much power now do you know I I I don't think they do know ah I think they should have power uh but I think there's also can be leadership that's exercise from the top of one of the things that I Would do is reform sequels which has been turned into an effort by trial lawyers to suit competitors and stopped\nDevelopment and that's limited and the supply of housing that's the California environmental quality I absolutely Sinai Ronald Reagan actually I think in Nineteen Seventy some what about you housing\nYou know look at it you're right over forty nights at a fifty of them per capita housing units and you're correct Utah's the only state producing less housing and the fact is we're producing about a hundred thousand plus or minus housing units on an annual basis in order to create some price equilibrium in this state\nA from a production perspective we want to be developing close to four times that number so you're right it is a issue of production but it's also an issue of intention allergy or lack there up\nThere are no state wide housing goals in California and new timelines no object is no strategy to organize at the local level the kind of determination to address this legitimate affordability crisis as it relates to your question\nAbout local as yes local ism has determinative\nBut there's a certain point where the nimby ism a there's a certain point with a lack of focus a in terms of producing a the requisite housing that's required in this day uh there's a certain point where the state of California it needs to intervene power incentivize good behavior or disincentive eyes bad behavior one of the specific plans\nOf the Fifteen specific plans we have to address this housing crisis\nComes to the issue of allocation of tax revenue\nMayors have a perverse disincentives rousing mayors actually have an incentive\nFor big bucks retail mayors collect cities collect\nRetail sales tax they don't collect property tax we would like to have that debate about re allocating that tax base you talking about reforming prop Thirteen were talking about attacks conversation around his house in conversations partners on the table that everything's on the table as it relates to this issue this is the issue\nThat defines the affordability crisis number two\nI think you also have to be a bit punitive\nAs it relates to local government I think one of the proposals that to me is most interesting and intriguing actually comes from this region the MTC metropolitan transit a commission is talking about utilizing their ability to check discretionary transit dollars\nIn allocate those trends of dollars to municipalities that are meeting their housing production goals and taking those dollars away from those that are not that's just too specific examples of how we can address distracts\nYou grab your yeah your major league was ...\nBut I didn't hear any of that by the way and get has been an office for sixteen years here in California and he's not\nYou know done much about this problem as it's gotten worse and worse and worse\nAh we've got to bring down the cost of housing and it's not enough just to apply incentives and disincentives but we also have to do\nIs make sure that we shorten the approval frame we uh we got to make sure that we uh what do you do this while I think we we work with local authorities frankly it to to ah basically modify a lot of the state laws that are making the process longer and longer and longer it takes twelve Fifteen Years\nI can build in Indiana and I can get approvals within six months or other states that have Democrat governors can build housing in a lot faster a lot less costly than California\nUh I you know failed to believe that we can't build housing that's ... more cost effective and available for people\n... that just because it's important point on sequence in the past John has argued for eliminating sequel not reforming and called for its eliminate I\nSpecifically I said to eliminate it and replace it with something that's more workable\nIn so I Believe in more categorical exemptions for socially desirable projects for ... excuse the walking around is more programmatic\nEnvironmental impact report to address the issue of pre development risk I Do believe the issue of time value of money in essence what John is getting at is an important part of the solution is well again that's why there's no one single strategy is going to address this issue that's why we've laid out fifty and I hope we can compare and contrast to listeners\nCompare and contrast our proposals are specific tangible plans because there is a profound contrast in the\nJunior high I have a lot of specific plans and of course those plans don't mean anything unless you're willing to go up against the special interests and\nYou know let me know what those these are interest groups that benefit we on a environmental groups that fund or the legislature as well as fund a Gavin campaign uh we've got to take that money out of that uh you know out of that game and we've got to make sure that we change the status quo\nI'm Brian White house counties in the state are trying to fix this tomorrow on ... MORNING EDITION\n\n\nAnd welcome back to ... we're talking with John Cox the Republican candidate for governor and Gavin Newsom the Democrat let's switch topics and talking about criminal justice a last month a Governor Brown signed a couple of bills giving the public\nUh under certain conditions more access to police personnel records and the video from police body cameras ... would you have signed either those misconduct\nNo I wouldn't have as a let me tell you I think we have a serious crime problem right here in the city now San Francisco is the number one city for property crimes and\nYou know Gavin was a mayor here for eight years or he didn't solve the homeless problem here at all and it's gotten worse and now a and not only that but Gavin was also the only statewide official to endorse prop forty seven which redefined a lot of felonies as misdemeanors\nAnd I'll give him a jazz us we're talking about transparency those builders specifically about transparency I've told me why you wouldn't\nHave I favor transparency I certainly favorite transparency uh but I think we have to work more with our law enforcement and give them the tools and the ability to deal with a a you know this particular situation is I I regret\nThe Gulf between the police and you know uh you know people in the neighborhoods I think there has to be a lot more communication\nI think we have to foster that but but going after the police and are opening up a you know private personnel records I think is is a you know it's just a kind of creates a fishing expedition for a trial lawyers\nI don't know how you can be pro transparency and oppose that bill\nA twenty seven states provide quote unquote some access to those records or what we did is reconcile that\nAnd it was a lot of compromise was a lot of work with law enforcement uh before I got on the governor's desk governors credit he let a lot of those efforts to find common ground and compromise it's about transparency it's also about trust\nA and I'm someone who believes very passionately are in very enthusiastically very supportive of the men and women in uniform same time you could be pro public safety and pro civil rights are and due process and I think uh we found a nice balance with the legislation the governor signed\nAnother another question on this topic got past governors at virtually every other governor except Jerry Brown has have reversed parole recommendations for most people who have come up for parole when they're serving life sentences with the possibility of parole Governor Brown has gone the other direction you a lot about eighty percent\nOf those throw recommendations to go forward into let those uh felons out on a ... onto a probation or out on the streets um would you do that ... would you would you go back to the way it was or do you think that the governor this governor's doing the right that oh I think\nWe have to be very tough uh you know I I lament the fact that our criminal justice system is letting you know so many people are and doing plea bargains\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or freedom theater at ... dot com\nAnd he had this guy had a wrap sheet as long as my arm but folks who have\nBeen recommended for parole by the probe already saying maybe you would why are they kind of person to\nHave no I Would look at I Would look at those judiciously of course and evaluate those on the facts and and the circumstances I mean I certainly\nBelieve in a a restoration I Am on the board of a a restore to justice mediation project in San Diego so I Do believe in reconciliation but you know and and rehabilitation of but I Want to make sure that the public is protected on each of the situation so I'll be I'll be pretty tough\nI Know you're you're also Catholic you've spoken about your Catholic great both of your Catholic or how does that figure into I remember talking to the governor about it and he talked about redemption and that's one of the reasons he was giving these folks have different second chance\nI I Do believe in redemption I I really do a I think uh someone who is committed a crime that's why\nThis restored of justice project is so important because it reconciled people offenders with their victims to make them understand what the hurt is their victims but I think we ought to the public to make sure that we applied for all judiciously and uh\nAnd that we have a a good set of eyes looking at this to make sure the value what am I think we do have a good set of eyes and we've had a good\nGovernance done the right thing I what I'm trying to reconcile John's answer is he says he would not\nUh continue a I think Neal lighting a sense to policies have Governor Brown a which has been about restoration has been about second chances has been in the spirit of\nWhat John was advancing I Would like to build on that I also like to build on governor Brown's criminal justice reform legacy and I've been a lot of I think very enlightened reforms kept the ideological about these reforms you've got to be open to argument interested in evidence has a relates to changing conditions if you think the jury trial out on whether they ... all of these things you have to be ...\nOr ... fifty seven about to be implemented forty seven three strikes a bee winner night which was ... you cannot be ideological or the fundamental responsibility of a governor any chief executive is public safety so that's always top of mind\nBut just locking folks up uh being quote unquote tough on crime I don't think it's necessarily the answer that's the old side I think being smart on crime or and I think the example of the last few years is a an example of that I I think is a much more enlightened approach and I want to build on that approach is coming from forty\nSeven as as widely acknowledged that had been a real problem\nRather owners who don't know we should say every gala measure that a downgrade it a lot of mostly drug crimes too from felonies ...\nAnd you talked to a lot of small retailers and they're finding that this is really creating problems for them and\nYou know a Gavin wants to continue governor Brown's a management or or or even worse and the fact of the matter is under Governor Brown people are further being priced out of the state they're leaving the state or in droves a\nA R schools and we've spent eighty percent more I Hope we talk about education because we've vastly increased spending for our schools and they're now in the bottom you know ...\nTen percent of the states and that's just not a situation that I Would want to continue and\nWe just had bail reform signed by the governor and that's going to take effect ah next year and a um I'm Wondering\nYou know all the judges are going to get a lot more discretion or because of that and there are some people feel both sides of that where that's a good idea or not but the other thing Governor Brown is he's really diversified the bench not just in terms of race and ethnicity but backgrounds he's appointed a lot of public defenders\nAnd a lot of defense attorneys in public interest attorneys is that it is that a trend you would continue or would you go around having a balance is a good thing but\nThis bail reform was not a good thing I mean what you're doing is replacing a private business with a\n... a lot more state workers and ah and that's really who uh who lobbied to get this done or why would a more state workers well because you're going to have a lot more people that are gonna have to go out now and bring people in and make sure that they appear for a further trials and that's a that's a real issue\nAnd and elimination industry you know listen this is all part of the same piece and that is that we have to make sure that the people are protected and it's not just rhetoric it's actual performance\nYou know let's talk about a battle reform only do tear taste Philippines and Trump's United States of America have money about California became the first state to step up and step into this debate and do the right thing\nOr is insidious from my humble perspective African Americans and Latinos are being incarcerated disproportionately for one reason the size of their ATM their bank balance not the likelihood that they'll actually commit a crime before their crimes are officially Judy Kate dispel reform was an extraordinary step\nForward or in a civil rights a effort not just a criminal justice reform I applaud the governor I applaud the legislature for their enlightened leadership and by the way in terms of\nMoving forward at one has to be yes very cautious about an application and implementation as it relates that judicial oversight and that is an expression of legitimate concern in the next governor will have to advance that concern by being very attentive to the implementation of that reform\nWe're not taking life calls on the show but we did through social media or solicit some questions and we've got one now sort of related to this topic of criminal justice let's listen\nTo my name is Michelle and I live in many and um I Would like to answer how they are going to handle them then I'll\nMention Cox gun violence\nWell you know one thing we need to do is stop publicized on names er and pictures of these perpetrators of these gun crimes are a lot of 'em are mentally ill if you you almost have to be mentally ill to take another person's life or the way that things have happened [noise]\nUh I think California's done a lot uh to keep guns out of the hands of people that are mentally deranged uh uh certainly be interested to look at more ways to to keep guns out of what would you have any other things you know I don't know uh but uh I think we've done a lot already uh\nDon't have any of the things you know I don't know uh but I think we've done a lot of ready ah I think what we need to do is we need to treat mental illness or we need to make sure that\nPeople uh you know who do commit these crimes that don't have their names and pictures publicized I think that's a mental illness as well even got control is is useful or not well you know criminals don't care about gun control I mean they they they'll break the law that's why they're criminals or you know the the more laws are not going to do the job [noise]\nUh I certainly favor keeping guns out of the hands of people who are dangerous people who are mentally ill and uh but you know the second amendment is an important them\nLet's let's be honest with with John's record he said gun safety laws are quote unquote a waste of time he prides himself being a lifetime member of the national Rifle Association doesn't believe in wait times ah and has been a strong advocate for concealed weapons concealed carry legislation\nOr in every one of these cases I think he's wrong and all I could say thankfully he's not been in a position of real leadership and influence in the state of California\nAh the forecast tomorrow sunny skies a little bit cooler than it was today and winds from the west tend to twenty miles per hour in the afternoon Wednesday partly cloudy and a little bit cooler ...\n\nAnd we continue our conversation with the candidates for governor John Cox and Gavin Newsom I Want to say that uh before today or we reached out to a lot of reporters that we respect from places like the LA Times cow matters San Francisco chronicle a Politico and our public radio partners and we got their suggestions for\nQuestions and topics and a lot of the questions are hearing today are a reflection of their input so I Want to thank them for that this\nQuestion though comes from one of our listeners let's listen\nMy name is Maria I lived in last Daniel California my question to both at the Carnegie\nYeah quite well they do to resolve the issue of our soul show every vote for folks to every city to deal with the illegal Iranian problems that\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or for him theater at ... dot com\nThe most important thing and uh I think we need to have law enforcement work together to make sure the public is safe um I've talked to a sheriff's all over the state who have told me that the sanctuary state law is an impediment\nOr to their ability to police uh their communities and to make sure that criminal activity is reduced uh they told me that they\nGet information uh and they have a information about gang activity about people who are engaged in in drug dealing and other kinds of\nThings and how does the century last stop them from pursuing them because if\nThey know that they're here illegally they can't inform ice until they actually go through and get a conviction under a lot of issues that are putting into the sanctuary state law\nUh I think if somebody's here illegally and they're in the Asian criminal activity I think it's up to our public officials to to to to keep them out uh I I don't want\nMy family to have their papers checked everywhere they are I don't want any family in California to have that\nWe should be checking papers at the border not a yard or not in the classroom or\nYou know you get rid of a century law that I Would get rid of the Hobby Lobby narrative\nWell I think we need to get the legislature to do that and and if they don't do it I think we need to get up to vote or the people at this this law I think is very unpopular uh I think it sends the wrong message a I think people want to know that they're going to have their law enforcement officials work together\nHere's one of the critters points of contrast between myself and John Cox uh he's someone who believes very passionately in building the wall\nOr he believes that sanctuary policy should be eliminated he believes in the elimination as he refers to the chain migration which is nothing more than family reunification I eat parents in almost every opportunity Donald Trump and Trump ism in Trump would have an advocate in Sacramento if he becomes the next governor as it relates to the issue\nOf immigration here the facts and with respect to the question I Hope the listener or has the benefit of listening to this and that is fundamentally\nA the immigrants with the state are\nUnder not over under represented in the criminal justice system\nThe fact is sexually counties are not more violent more dangerous than non sanctuary cities and counties quite the contrary sanctuary policies nothing more than ... it's about community policing it's about building trust a victim of crime or a witness a crime is more likely to come forward if they're not worried\nAbout local law enforcement being an arm of federal ... immigration deportation they're more likely to get\nA their child educated drop them off at school if they're not worried about a school crossing guard being part of that immigration arm accordingly they're more likely this time of year flu season to get an immunization shot and be healthier and they're not worried about the nurse or turning them over I fear under a Cox administration working hand in glove with Donald Trump\nOr that our policies are progressive and in light and policies on immigration out will roll back into the dark ages\nMisery got you once said I think that you would arrest CEOs that hired undocumented immigrants is that does that reflect you know I think they need to\nMake sure that we provide a guest worker program and other avenues for people but yeah I think we should not be hiring people who have broken the lawn and cutting line will make it ... I think a lot of them are 'cause I don't know\nUh when we would need to to to determine that but I think every country has a right to trim its borders and unfortunately the country to the south of us had twenty six thousand murders last year\nUh I don't want to see drugs guns and human trafficking come across that border and I think\nYou know a border wall is a necessary I live in San Diego and it's had some effect there but\nThe you know the Republican mayor of San Diego opposes the wall\nMaybe so but you know it's it's a lot of people you know I think it's the right thing to do a you know uh having said that I Am not in favor of checking papers in classrooms are on people's yards and going around and taking people out who are obeying the law what about ice ... I I Want to make sure\nThat if somebody is in involved in criminal activity that and hit there he'll illegally they should be removed from the state\nYou know let me just said it's about the wall to wall it's a monument to stupidity\nOn the wall is intended to divide this country a John may be familiar with this I Hope others are as well forty percent of people here without documentation came here because they overstay their visa many flu\nOr this notion of a sixth century solution to twenty first century ... problem is ludicrous from my perspective\nAs it relates to sanctuary and there are certainly should be sanctuary when people are accessing the court system and I subscribe to a point of view that's allied\nWith the vast majority of judges that belief that should be neutral territory and I should not be coming in rating our court system where people are trying to access justice for participating in the justice system\nWhen you were there and I know you remember this there was a terrible murder of a father and I think two sons have committed live in a committed by somebody was here illegally I had been in the juvenile justice system and I was not a turned over to the police are and I wonder are you know you've been implemented a policy to turnover juveniles accused of crimes before they were convicted was that a mistake\nYeah due process I mean the fact is if I had that to do over again the issue of due process was the missing link there look the point is as sanctuary policy is not a shield for criminal activity no one is suggesting somehow John implied\nOr that people have the right or to unfettered or violence in the state regardless of their immigration status they need to be held to account the question is due process and so the Internet of quality of these laws require some objectivity not an ideological prism that's why Governor Brown\nRequire some objectivity not an ideological prism that is why Governor Brown has an example amended the sanctuary law that he was in ... that he was handed a with eight hundred specific conditions where we can coordinate and collaborate with ice along the lines of some of the mistakes and lessons were learned from one of those\nConditions was that the state prisons were exempted from now that legislation would you change that I should prisons to be part of it\nI think I I I stand by what the governor did today but I'm open to argument as new evidence and new conditions present themselves [noise]\nAll right let's talk about a timely topic a climate change uh today is the one year anniversary of the wildfires up in ah the north bay dozens of people killed thousands of structures are destroyed homes and there's a new report out today from the United nations on climate change are saying that these\nTerrible changes to climate or coming more quickly than we thought and they say you can't really be addressed without\nEven like getting rid of coal altogether and so I'm Wondering you know California has taken a lot of steps or do you agree with those what additional steps Mr Cox do you think it should take her what were some of the mistakes we've made so far in an acting somebody's going to a bar my policy ...\nI'm not an idiot log on this ah I'm I'm a problem solver I'm I'm also not a climatologist upset in the past that I'm not a but I'll certainly listen to climatologists on this I Believe the earth is getting warmer a and humans may well have a a an effect on to\nA and I want the air as clean as possible I drive an electric car I'm proud of that\nAh the point is that a are we getting enough of an impact on the world's a atmosphere or to justify the cost or to the people the state India and China are dumping tons of carbon in the ass\nBut they've also signed on to the Paris Agreement which they should\nBecause they're they're we have outdoor as well but what we're doing a lot we've done a lot in California to clean the air\nFrankly the politicians are like you haven't you know have failed miserably or to police the uh the forest in and take care of the forest and managed to for us the carbons that was released a by the fires and it's it's a one year anniversary of those fires\nThe carbon released by those fires uh was you know comprised months of carbon from cars and trucks that were working to try to reduce\nSo Governor Brown just signed us be one hundred which requires the state by twenty forty five to get all of its energy from clean sources would you have signed up\nWith no because what we're going to do that is we're going to double electricity prices a worthy goal it's a wonderful lofty goal to have I I certainly want the ear to be clean a but we're going to keep\nHounding people at the state in the poverty electricity prices an estate all already almost twice with Texas pays a the hundred percent renewable is a wonderful goal but it's also going to drive people further into poverty we can't keep doing it to the people the states of John\nCox uh ... celebrate or at least acknowledged a enthusiastically that Donald Trump or did the right thing when he pulled out of Paris I reject that and I applaud the leadership in the state of California Governor brown\nJim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of lame is now through November fourth of the German or for your for your

even before the ... fire demolish thousands of homes last year now rents just sky high vacancy rates are very low and middle and low income people who used to call Santa Rosa home\nAre wondering if there is a place for them Santa Rosa is in desperate need of housing but what kind and where and should the city be developing and forested areas that have burned before and they will burn again let me tell you who is joining us for the hour we want to welcome for the mayor of Santa Rosa crisscrossing the morning they're good to be with us\nWe also have a Julie comes with us as a council member on the Santa Rosa city council good morning to you can\nAnd will say good morning a JD Morris who's also with us here local government reporter for the Santa Rosa press Democrat morning the morning glad to have you and glad to Micah Weinberg here as well who's president of the economic Institute at the bay area council morning Michael the morning welcome to all of you and let's begin a if I may mayor of course he with you and I like to begin\nBy just talking about what your senses well you can get us on board in terms of what we're moving forward in terms of rebuilding but before what about the morale of the city as you see\nI think that the morale of the city is good um you know after the fires last year we had a tremendous outpouring of of love and support from everyone in in Santa Rosa snowman county bay area around the country really are as you know\nTens of millions of dollars were raised to help folks are recovered from the fire\nThat feeling is continued throughout the past year or last night in downtown Santa Rosa we had a fairly quiet an observation of the anniversary and you could still feel the same feelings really that uh we felt a year ago\nThat's been somber I Know a year later but at the same time there's a feeling of resiliency of the community moving together and moving forward\n[noise] absolutely um you know ... it's a tough questions to say how the community is doing because the recovery is is proceeding well\nOn on the global scale you know the numbers are are large of of people who are in the rebuilding process but by ... you know what's what's not reflected as all the people who are still are really starting their own recovery\nAnd I remember asking you right after the fire what do you say to people who say you know I'd like to rebuild but I don't want to go through this again it happens fifty four years ago the ... fire or it's going to be cyclical and especially in certain areas it's really very risky\nIt is I'm In California is a risky place to live if if you live in California uh it's likely\nThat you're going to experience a fire or an earthquake or a mudslide or a flood um we weigh those risks we'd balance those risks with the the desire to live in a beautiful place and um people who are rebuilding have to make those those decisions\nLet's talk about the rebuilding of America sees specifically because uh there was a Mercury News headline and it said a a coffee park is coalescing I think they use that word coalescing a fountain grove still has a lot to do I mean there there is a kind of a a real comparison contrast between those two communities in terms of progress yeah\nYes it has concerned me also I had hoped that our council would not allow natural gas piping into the high fire risk areas in the week the written wild land urban interface\nUm so that's one of the battle so far we have not been able to move that proposal forward a and that's too bad it it just doesn't make sense to me that we would put natural gas typing into a fire area\nI Know also you've been concerned about homelessness a Santa Rosa let's talk about that with you for a moment Newark and bring the\nUh the others and and I want to go to Michael Weinberger as well and talk about the economic side of development ah but when when we're talking about a displacement now we're talking about displacement operating on a number of levels began will be displaced because the landlord wants to reclaim\nA or there'll be displaced because uh the rent is too high I mean there's all kinds of reasons so you're homeless rate as the as far as the populations increase about six percent yes it has and it's going up it had yes so what are we doing what can we do\nOh that's a that's a really a tough one um that's that's another place where we have created a joint\nA group with the\nCounty um to address homeless issues to create a um planted\nTo combine and more efficiently spend our resources with the county to solve some of our homeless issues we've adopted a housing first model so and um I for one hope that at some point we will establish as safe parking area ... city property\nUm that's another one that stuff I reach [noise]\nUm we have to have folks have a place to go while we are engaged in the rebuilding process so we need to rebuild we need to produce housing we need to protect tenants and we need to preserve the existing affordability that we have and without doing all three things will continue to have probably\nA lot of News I'm Michael Weinberger to which you have to say about these days I mean Michael Lindberg in his prison economic Institute at the bay area council what about development and fire risky areas from your perspective\nWell I mean I I think the first thing I just want to say but the city and county have done a lot of wonderful things uh and of course the people in the community rebuilding from the fire and met with block captains that a supervisor James Gore has a has been organizing and many many others um but\nWe need to say a lot of things also to help development to absolutely the waivers raises waiving fees putting together J. P. A. and\nSo on and it's not enough\nUm we just to one quick data point\nIt actually is shocking to me to Norma county out of all the nine bay area counties had the highest rate of families that have housing costs burden so over foreign time families in two thousand Fifteen before the fires happen you would think it would be to look in Bali or San Francisco no it's right here in Sonoma County\nSo we just need to understand if we say we walk development yes but it has to be X Y Z and it has to be you know this level of uh this area and and this type of development\nThat we start limiting the amount of development that we have and there are enormous implications to that you mentioned for example homelessness\nIf we do not find a way to build more homes we will build more tense\nBut there are\nLow income fountain garbage in the wild land a short haired that high income absolutely\nBut that's how this placement happens when you don't build housing for people who are higher income they out compete for people who are lower income and it pushes them out\nHigher income they out compete for people who are lower income and it pushes them out at the periphery there are so many people that were sort of you know that cat poster to hang on baby right they were already like just hanging on by their claws\nBefore all of this happened and so they end up being the people who are now\nA lot of cases no longer living here who have already been displaced who are mega commuters there are people commuting into and out of ... county chew and more and more hours each way every day so\nUm I think a lot of wonderful things have been done obviously we need to think carefully about uh whether we're going to be building and especially the unincorporated areas in the wild urban interface I think it's a harder question when you're talking inside city limits in areas where they will be building to a higher coach standard\nWell there's been a lot that's been done there's a whole suite of of rules allowing people to live in our lease for example and these tiny houses that have a\nAn occupied I'm granny units are and so forth so there's guest houses and things of that sort of I mean there's lots of ... as you suggested a lot in many ways that the city has done and move forward on that really needs to be it seems to me highlighted but\nYou've got all these people who are out of any kind of a roof over their head you've got a serious crisis on your hands and what to do about that particularly in light of the fact that developers well in fact what ... what is it what are you concerned so I think there's environmental regulations still endangered species act isn't it\nYeah well I mean any one of these concerns um and they're all important you know salamanders are important every but humans are also important and at some point we need to say\nAre all of the regulations that we have every one of which is cherish precious way by very large an organized group if everybody continues to get their way on those things were going to continue to get the outcomes that we've gotten and so we need to understand\nHow are we going to balance these competing priorities around\nResilience and around inclusion so I Will say I think that the majority of the city council made the right decision in the development and fountain grow up I think that was a good ... I understand the other competing consideration but I think that was probably the right call\nThis is a pretty delicate balance we're talking about earlier crisscross he I mean how do you get through this you got so many vested interests here and people want well can't have it all\nThree there absolutely are many vested interests and you know the the the people who live in the community now or get to have a say in in what happens to the community and the future um as far as the regulations and the the environmental constraints\nI just I Need to say that ... has a plan um has the inventory of of land available as the as owning in place\nTo build the five thousand homes that we think that we need 'em to that plan is is that of those five thousand half of them twenty five hundred will be available to people who make less than the median income [noise]\nUm the the important thing that we need to do is provide the resource to create those homes for less than than market rate\nAnd that that's what we're trying to do with measure in a November six trillion things of this\nI mean to put as it is a tricky thing to do because we need two thirds a positive vote on it and two thirds of any kind of a tax measure is is a tough bar to cross\nUm I've actually been involved in campaigns that have done that in the past though and I'm and I'm thinking that the the voters of Santa Rosa care about their neighbors their kids\nUm their friends their co workers the future I'm a ... workers of the city and that they will vote yes on November ...\nAll one piece of good news Micah Weinberg is the market starting to suffer the\nWell I mean that's good news and bad news right I mean it's good news for affordability it's potentially bad news for new developments getting talk about some of these issues are good news bad they are they um by the\nIt is really good I mean I'm excited about a measure on them excited about the prospect of the use of tax increment financing cities lost a lot of their uh ability to really be of help with these projects mean redevelopment went away as possible something like that would come back in the news administration reformed in some way\nSo there are lots of things that can be done to get more affordable housing and ... are doing a lot of them\nWere coming up on those are you in the audience if you'd like to be recognized to ask a question please raise your hand we will find you a we do want your input and this and do want to hear from you your thoughts are as well as your questions\nAnd if you would like to join us or you can do so by emailing us for like ... dot org are going to our website cake you eat out or slash for I'm not talking to the listeners obviously you can also tweet us our Twitter handle is at ... for um\nWe're talking one year after that the fires in Santa Rosa in Sonoma County talking with Chris core see who is mayor Santa Rosa Julie combs council member of the city council JD Morris local government reporter for the\nSanta Rosa press Democrat and Michael Weinberger president and the economic Institute at the bay area council Michael Krasny [noise]\nIs coming up in our second hour of form this morning one year after the devastating north say wildfires is the region more prepared at ten will look at efforts to improve emergency response systems stay with us for more of the special for them on the road broadcast from the Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa and to listen to past\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ...

I I Want to speak up for what our city does end and\nPoint out that we've done and are in the process of implementing a twenty four point housing action plan\nUm we had streamlined we had done he I ours for prevailed in we have specific plans a debt\nFacilitate the development in certain areas I'm as my my colleague that mayor mentioned we've dropped significantly dropped impact fees are in our downtown we've cut water hook up costs in half\nUm and we have come to the public asking for measure and that's in his neighbor um said that we can get a housing bonds\nSaid that we can get a housing bond on that one hundred and twenty four million dollars thirty cents a person I day\nWould go massively to stimulate the construction in our downtown to getting that taller buildings and all of it is for Ford ability so I I mean I think there is I'm not a lot\nMore that a small town well I shouldn't say small town where the fifth largest in the town to town\nOf where the fifth largest in the bay area but there's not a lot that his city can do without backup from the state and federal government and and I'm One of the things I'm doing is working regionally with the committee to has the bay area it's nine bay area consortium blue ribbon panel\nTo work with the legislature on creating the kinds of change that we need to see so we can implement housing here\nOh good luck with that we're going to go to the audience now in a welcome to the morning\n[noise]\nThese one measure I realize that the state has passed a law that allows um extra house on every law just about in the state and I wonder how that is being helped by measure in and I'm also wondering if someone knows how it's being dealt with throughout the bay area maybe make a nose\nYeah these are the ... this is just the bay area council sponsored a couple of people pieces of this legislation I every time I say accessory dwelling unit a colleague gets their wings 'em by you know I think the the interesting thing about access redrawing units as they are\nGentle density so there are lots of different you know you can go up in three dimensions or you can have these houses are on your properties and I think it's a very important part of the the housing conversation is not the only part of the housing conversation\nOften they are not eligible for a lot of the other financing mechanisms around affordability so actually in some of the consulting work that we've been doing with the public officials we've been wondering whether we could do more to create these units that are sort of affordable by design by their nature\nYou know what I'm struck by the facts and let me go back to your mayor of course the on this we haven't even discuss the zoning codes are because those has to come under scrutiny what's happening on that front\nUm before I answer that question the second part of the question was how measure and might affect ... or ... grand a year and it\nSent a measure in a requires at ... at least Seventy five percent of of the proceeds go to creating affordable rental housing for people who make less than the median family income\nBut up to twenty five percent of it can be used for uh people who qualify for on the affordability of the the income level\nOr for um assistance for um eighty you construction a for first time homebuyers downpayment assistance or four fires survivors who are able to to um uh fill all the unmet needs that they have but again this is for people\nWho are um are qualifying under the affordability restrictions\nAnd now if you would zoning codes and rebuilding I mean we're we're not\nOurs are zoning codes have have not been changed on any broad level for quite a while we're going to be looking at our general plan within the next couple of years but you know as I said before we had zoning in place to meet the needs a for housing in the city\nAnd here's Carol the west and Michael you on this can you ask your guest about the high cost of rebuilding costs of materials have skyrocketed and finding contractors as difficult folks are leaving because they can't afford to rebuild\nIts about what by the way about six percent a matter of course you know in terms of it as far as people leave there I I don't know the names of vigorous Democrat\nAt a recent analysis that said\nI'm about seven thousand people which is much less than six percent I don't know what I that figure was reached through a ... a an analysis that I'm not sure holds up with with real good scrutiny\nBut we don't have the data to to really know what the numbers are I Know a lot of anecdotal stories are people I Know of have left town uh but we don't know what the number\nI think that the first Democrat says that seven thousand was for people who actually left the county a lesson so\nFirst of all I mean the problem is there hasn't been an official estimate of that which there really needs to be I think that's information will be a hard day everybody would like to have\nSo that was part of the difficulty in arriving at that number but seven thousand um I Believe it was my colleague Martin and that's been those who did that story but I think it was that was the number of people that left Santa Rosa a lot of those people actually just went somewhere else in the county\nAnd we found that at least I think it was Thirteen hundred left the county I so um yeah but it it could have been higher I mean that would not surprise me\nI Want to speak quickly to the question on the cost of materials we've been talking about some very difficult tradeoffs but there are some issues that are easy we should not be in a terrorist base to trade war that is dramatically raising the cost of seal\nFor building some of these high density development that actually is not a difficult question\nBut we have a question for the audience or at least to come and go back to the audience this is Catherine\nI'm kind of tangential to what we've been speaking about the community of Santa Rosa and I think the greatest thing in my\nCounty area was very moved by the response of people opening up their hearts and their checkbooks and enormous amounts of money we're raised and yet we hear about people leaving the city leaving the county people had\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the

as making it to the people that need it how about\nMonitoring let me go to the U.S is the [noise]\nUm yeah I mean we've done a story about that um you know how that money or being you know distributed I'm Sorry I I think to some extent there has been there to probably be a lot more um you know there was a lot of money\nRaised definitely including through our um north bay federally funded by the press some are crowded with um redwood credit union and Mike McGuire as office but I didn't need is a lot higher than that and it may have looked like\nA you know really splashy dollar figure I forgot what it was at the end of the day but there's always gonna be a bigger need the housing costs here are just so high\nOn the market is so tough that you know that generosity I'm really needs to um keep coming is what people are telling me the folks that I talked\nTo so and then run ads that you know I've I've seen and heard\nDiscussion about what the city or the county has done with all the money that was donated a after the fires\nThe city in the ... county did not receive those donations they were made to to private entities to philanthropic organizations I I Know that those organizations have have distributed that money but it's not for the city and county to\nTo audit um so um I don't have those answers\nYou have any ideas on how much are the nonprofit sector has stepped up and maybe in a rut figure\nI Know it's in the tens of millions of dollars it's around fifty or sixty million dollars\nTo us it's extraordinary and uh certainly help people very grateful let me go back to the homeless population or if I may was usually combs\nBecause you've got people who are really vulnerable and you also have undocumented workers who haven't been able to find housing and who are not

best\nFire chief in a state with Tony ... and very grateful for everything and he dies [noise]\nUm [noise]\nThirty five thousand thirty five thousand six hundred mutual aid calls were uh advance last year eleven thousand went unanswered the chief along with a chief Jones requested about three hundred and thirty fire engine in the first twelve hours of this blaze in about a hundred and fifty arrived\nWe also have to beef up our fire response and change they the way we respond to fires which means pre positioning firefighting resources into communities are under threat\nOf a red flag ovens hot weather and high winds so that we have boots on the ground we don't have to wait for the calvary to come running can I ask you achieve customer whether to what's being done on that score\nYeah well you know when we had a red flag warning we typically wouldn't staff up unless there was a\nUm incidents around the state so we're gone down in our county we look at Cal Fire we look at other partners do we add resources on these other fires\nThe night of October ... Seventeen we're full staffing so we were in a good place the problem with that and I was we had three major fires happen in our area alone ... county in Mendocino and Lake County\nAnd they were such extreme fires that all resources were drawn down a immediately so we had Seventy extract teams or by twelve thirty at night and they really didn't show up till till the ... most of them tell the sun was coming up and that's a difficult thing to do because\nWhat we had to do is just prioritize when when we did receive a Clement we would just send them to communities I Need to go to coffee park time with his division and and you know do the best you can I Need to go to a mark less springs time with this division so now it's\nSponsorship of ... the live stream by essay Jim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth at the gym or for your theater at the gym at ... dot com\nAnd at one particular building made sure that that building and burn we had to protect Kaiser hospital so you have to deploy resources to do that so when you have three thousand houses just in the city on fire it's very difficult to to feel like you're making a\nDifference when you say very difficult maybe an understatement since ... let me let me go to achieve Jones is also with us here this morning ... like that but you're the chief was Cal Fire and the message is still coming from Cal Fire but vegetation above management of a defensible spaces and education\nWhat more I mean that's been kind of the tripod that we've had than we've heard before especially in light of this like I said the worst fires ever hit was wealth or ever hit the state\nYes it has been a very since last October and for years prior to that we've had an enormous amount of education I'm basically from drought and it's the fuel loading that we've had has been enormous um the fires that we've experienced statewide have been longer\nUm and cause more damage than ever before our fire seasons are longer um\nThere's a lot of different things that are going on in the state as we continue to\nFocus on vegetation management and uh luckily and unfortunately and by er and like never spoke on the um [noise] a couple of the grant funds that had been afforded to Cal Fire\nOn so Cal fire's able we've got I Believe it's a hundred and fifty five million dollars in forest health and fire prevention grants that are\nUm get into the communities um get into a local agency is apt to apply for 'em to do some vegetation management because here's a reality on each of us can't do it by ourselves and it's going to take a lot more we got here\nI'm from suppressing fire ... meeting Smokey the bear did a great job in his campaign is that wild land fires are bad which I think most people in my opinion um have\nA now pushed over two fires that fire is not that\nI'm prescribed fire in the right capacity and the right format is a good thing um um our forefathers used fire to help clear to land for\nUm forging and hunting and allowing those things we we don't want fire 'em in our area that we need to get back to it so prescribed fires doing some vegetation management working with um ... operators because again we can't do all by ourselves\nAre working with the fire wife's communities are working with um many at than on non government agencies in order to um put some fire on the ground and put some vegetation management is what we're focusing on some\nSort of let me just quickly or go to you on some insurance came up in the last hour or so that's about it there was all article Bloomberg and fact about shielding or those who have high premiums sets the expensive homeowners in other parts of the state this is a real issue for many people\nIt is and this is an FCC regulated a radio station so I'm not going\nTo start cussing I'm a ... a year ago a what I say this is an embarrassment an embarrassment that we cannot get real reform the insurance industry to be able to help those survivors or who have been impacted by the fire [noise]\n\nWe had a bill we had a bill that was being in advance that would have mandated across the board Seventy five percent pay out of an individual's belongings out when they lose their home in a governor declared disaster\nThe average by the way I'll say in the north a firestorm as far as insurance corporations they're paying out Seventy five percent\nSome did good and they weren't they didn't have to be browbeat and to get there so we're not\nAnd what I Would say is that uh this legislature needs to grow a backbone\nStand up to the insurance industry and make sure that we're passing legislation that will help homeowners homeowners recover and rebuild because it's going to impact or our economy and it's impacting lives and I don't say that lightly but it makes me mad as hell that we continue to fight over these\nMinimum reforms that will help individuals rebuild their lives uh and I'm\nAlso say we've also seen significant reforms in the state and just going off of work you've Jones was that is Cal fire's now for the first time in history a year round firefighting force\nWe've invested forty point two million dollars and Cal Fire McClellan air attack base which is the largest air attack this year in the state is now year round for the first time we're finally phasing out all Vietnam Era firefighting helicopters for Cal Fire and replacing them with Black Hawk air attack helicopters that confided\nNine Seventy five million has been put into mutual aid but in particular up focusing on pre position that we can get those troops on the ground that both she got her and she Jones needs a prior to the event breaking out\nBut I should have

conversation at the national level to change the federal policy in pushing the telecommunications providers to provide additional capabilities for alert warning\nAnd this includes the ability to now provides Spanish language warnings there'll be effective next year that would not have happened without the experiences that we went to an October\n[noise] let me go to another a number of our audience fall let's go next welcome thank you um my wife and I are senior citizens who are renting a home\nIn coffee part for the last ten years\nI'm an about one thirty in the morning we got out of the house of because of our personal vigilance and we were able to uh notify several of our neighbors of what was happening\nUm we got no warning whatsoever from anything ended the failure of the system was caused authored one of our neighbors died\nUm and like I say we were vigilant we did our part we really need your help\nAnd support any help that you can give us so this never happens again thank you [noise]\n\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bike has said Jim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the patron or for your theater at the gym at death dot com\nRide to nix all you may not have received the alert that is why we need new state wide standard we cannot rely just on cell phone technology and everything has to be an opt out you get the alert no matter if you like it or not\n... the city will it's in Mendocino County didn't have power so coverage landline coverage Internet and cable for the greater part of five days during the firestorm in redwood complex fire\nThe only thing that they had was radio not one alert was distributed on a radio station with this legislation or our philosophy lab and proud and his many a medium communication mediums as possible\nAnd let me ready to come from a listener named Carolyn and then maybe a you or or a Chris can tell us about where people can go with these kinds of questions as well as perhaps answer ... question\nShe says can you ask your guest why I Am not getting any of the alerts including the latest ones I received all the next ... during the fires last October once I opted in but it shouldn't stop receiving any alerts is it my carrier or phone or something else\nSo I'll jump on that as the director now responsible for the local emergency management warning systems called so call alert\nWe did get a lot of feedback as a result of our tests on September tenth\nWhere people had signed up in the past and they did not get an alert or wireless message and there may be a variety of reasons for some of them could be technical you're out of range your phone was off you didn't have it set on audible but in many cases we're finding that people that had signed up\nWe've got an incomplete record of their phone number they put it in six digits instead of seven so we're asking everyone that had an issue with that\nTo call us and let us know or go on line to confirm it so called ... dot org that their ... their accounts intact that their phone numbers are updated\nOr call the county officer emergency services I personally handled\nFour or five dozen phone calls directly addressing this issue we need to get this accurate information into our registration system and especially in preparation for the new state state mandate that we're going to capture as much information from variety of resources so you're automatically enrolled in the system in the future\nTo make a transition to the last hour and let me go to Shawn Johnson and uh to chief customer on this or just to get you to weigh in on it or are we talking about really a breaking rules for rebuilding as opposed to I'm really strictly following are strengthening the building codes I Want to find out where both of you stand to begin with you she films\nThat Cal Fire is also the state fire marshal the utilize the data I'm from the damages section and that was done on the an eight thousand plus structures that were damaged or destroyed to determine how they burn\n'em what's sad the symptoms that that particular structure burning wise\nAnd and develop new standards for um our\nFire codes et cetera um so they use that data in many ways that that primarily is one of the best ways that they use and and take that information and we also and\nIt was just talking about preparation there's going to do is not to be another fire him instead of\nFires wild land fires are going to happen it's not a matter of a question as its land so we all need to be prepared I'm there and I was ... when you asked me earlier and things that can be done on that that department's focusing on Russia focusing on education and so on there's a great app\nUm it's a Cal Fire apps and that you can use for yourself you can download it and walk around your home and take a look at your property and see what I'm you can do to provide clarity says there's also a I'm ready for wildfire dot org I encourage all of you to look at that and it gives you some opportunities to look at\nUm preparation for your home evacuation plan things that you should know people the contacts so I encourage you for that you\nTook us to go to you on this\nYeah sure you know the mayor a mentioned that Twenty one of the twenty two homes that were built that harden standard perished and we have a fire station that was two years old that was built to that standard that perished\nAnd part of the problem is not all the buildings were built to that standard so when the house catches on fire and has allowed to burn burn very hot for very long time and those houses aren't even at heart and are not designed to take that kind of heat for that to ration\nRight so I'm a big fan of if we're going to be building in these areas we need to build hardened homes\nExcuse me uh we need to build hard heart and homes and we got to pay attention to vegetation management it is a regional approach and we need to take\nUm it's I I Will remind you that fountain girls was a fire wise community they won't awards for their vegetation minute for a program coffee park was even in the wildland urban interface\nTo areas that were just decimated and just because of what happens around us as opposed to what happens in us and so part of it is is a regional approach for vegetation management and it has to include everything Bernie like Sean I mentioned chemical mechanical grazing different land use a processors and we have to harden our homes\nOr as well as we got to maintain our homes so when we build a home we'll we'll put a little plant it's as big as my water bottle and a year later it's three feet tall and four feet wide right under our the use of our house\nSo we there's ways to minimize the damage that can happen because there will be fire so we really just have to we have to educate more we have to get out more um and and there are ways to do it\nOr we just have to be a better at it\nThe worst complacency came up in the last ... hours that something you're encountering a set of problems a year later yeah\nYeah you know everybody's in a different space right um there's everyone's\nHe's in a different space right um there's everyone's busy in today's world and and I will never happen to me is what I hear a lot of and I'm here to tell you I've been\nSpoke at many different forums and and uh I'm here to tell you it can happen to you so\nPay attention have that situation awareness take care of your property do what you can make your your system are survivable that night and we had such great wins most people when they're it's windy you put all your furniture right next to the house and blow away\nThat catches embers so if there's embers blowing through the neighborhood it catches those catches on fire and then burns up into the addict\nSo there's a lot of things that just makes me think of the events to well we have special events hardened buildings have special events I I've heard sprinklers on the roof sprinklers would have done nothing for that firing at times it was just too windy\nI'm so will the tornado really right so there's a lot of there's a lot of things well this is what we can do but in reality they won't work based on what we experience but we can do is make sure our Latin landscape is taking care of our houses are harden and we're aware of what's happening\nAgain Tony ... is a fire chief of Santa Rosa and let me go to the audience and if you want to join please just raise your hand we'll go next to Nancy Nancy welcome\nHello yes um I Lived Jon Benet ridge halfway between Glen Ellyn and a Santa Rosa we've got absolutely no warnings whatsoever uh people knew that there was a fire and Ken would they knew that at our small fire station but they said it's it's it's a ways away [laughter]\n[noise] um and we got no alerts and my husband was signed up for next so he got an alert the day after the fire\nI'm there is there were sirens in a kid would and I believe in Glen Ellen at the fire stations that we could hear on Bennett ridge\nAnd people could have been able to evacuate if they had heard that and just wake up and heard that siren they would know that something was wrong most of us wiped out because we smelt smoke\nOr we heard the people driving down the road and that was all that we had so I Would urge you to consider those low tech things in places like her in jail [noise]\nFancy thank you a good yeah for the reminder anybody want to come into what I'm saying it's a it's kind of what his supervisors have really taking to heart what happened\nIn our community and they're looking at a complete revamp of all the issues emergency Miller an emergency response one of the items with the board of supervisors is currently looking looking at is deploying sirens in targeting rural areas throughout the county [noise]\nUm [noise] but [noise] I",
