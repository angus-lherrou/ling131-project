burden of war\nBut as much as he describes the mental and physical toll war takes on an individual presidents he also writes\nThen wars are increasingly being entered into the ... the president not Congress the book examines the complex decisions wartime presidents have struggled with throughout history from the war of Eighteen twelve to the present day and what they're going to war is still subject to the will of the American people Michael Beschloss has authored nine books on presidential history and it's been called\nThe nation's leading presidential historian buy Newsweek and he joins us for this for um our look at Michael Beschloss\nTime from Michael how are you I'm good and delighted to have you here I was saying thank you I Am too\nSaying one of my producer is a boy it's been so long at least a decade since we've had ... and then I realize you've been writing this book for the last and you're right it took ten years I'm Sorry [laughter] nothing to be with all of that I Would have loved to get a ... really needed to take that long as it turns out\nWhile you're covering almost two centuries and nine prisoners rights as a lot of territory and rock has a really much to recommend that it's a lot of narrative a force it really is compelling and uh before I go on a praising let's go to the actual thesis of the book which I think I just addressed\nThat is increasing sense of a more and more power for presidents when it comes to war I guess the key point really was true in\nYeah that's exactly right you know as you know when the constitution the founders wanted to make sure that presidents did not become dictators and they felt that the way that people in Europe kings and and the monarchs of Europe took power elicit lead most of all was when they got to be unpopular\nThey would come up with some reason to go to war\nThe country would go to war of the nation would be United and once again the ... the king was popular again and so the founders as you know we're trying really hard to make sure that\nPresidents never got too much power so you look at the constitution of president wants a war what the constitution says is that Congress has to be the ones to declare it but as history moved on more and more presidents took that power for themselves and you're absolutely right Michel\nThe moment that was really key was Harry Truman in June of Nineteen fifty the north Koreans invaded the south\nTruman said okay we Americans have to respond with force\nAnd his advisors said you know if you're if you've got a major war in mind Mr President you've got to go to Congress and ask for war declaration the same way but James Madison did and all these presidents all the way up to\nHe can send you messages exalted himself and get giving you orders conceivably using exactly that same mechanism you know our liberties are always in danger but they are most in danger when you've got a president in a war\nAnd you also have a president who in fact we played a kind of years where you were talking about how uh he had said at one point Obama's going to lead us into war in Iran or President Obama's going to do that because it will ensure his being re elected and he really kind of laid out the fact that he saw\nThe presidential power as a way of indeed not only conducting a war leading a war leading us into war but also a helping boost the elections likely bit uh in fact it was true about Madison or as you said earlier going all the way back so there's this is who\nCan see which which is really scary that those two ideas are in Donald Trump's had that war helps you politically and he has also said I notice he said that the great presidents in history or those who have waged war not the greatest idea to be in his head at this moment\nOf course historian says are often validated that haven't they I mean there's been this sensed it Roosevelt in Lincoln were great presidents because they let us through these terrible that rather just for\nThat is true but what I'm worried about is a president who is has the capability of\nDoing war like things may even be doing those right now [noise] feeling but to rewards for that could be number one you help yourself politically winning an election elevating your poll ratings and also you might be well rewarded by history is not wrong but I'd rather not have that in his brain right now\nWe also are facing many of us as citizens of this country that concerned about uh someone like President Trump with his hands on the nuclear weapons but there's a time that you write about were actively use of nuclear weapons has actually advanced\nYeah that was one of the scopes in the book in the early Nineteen sixty eight LBJ was\nWaging the war in Vietnam which he did mostly badly made terribly terrible mistakes but he did do one good deed it turns out from these documents I got that were just declassified and that is in January of Nineteen sixty eight his commander William Westmoreland in Vietnam said\nWhy don't we avert a defeat in Vietnam by considering the use of tactical nuclear weapons or maybe chemical warfare\nUm and move nuclear weapons to Vietnam right now when there's got to Johnson and Johnson said we're not going to do that you know that's the last thing on earth I Want you to this this war that's going so badly now going nuclear\nAnd Johnson was so adamant about it he said lock up all the documents that show what Westmoreland has asked put them in a safe I don't want some general\nLearning about this and saying I'm avoiding away\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware deletion celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nAnd and that by the way Michael is you know sometimes\nPeople say it doesn't matter who is president I Hope that no one who was lived through the last two years of our history would say that it doesn't matter who is president but in case there is one person listening who still thinks that that might be true\nYou need someone with that kind of wisdom and understanding that if a general is beginning to talk about nuclear weapons in a war that's totally peripheral our to our security as being um was civil war to agricultural country you need a president with Johnson's firmness who will shut that down\nWhat are your thoughts so Michael about the census particularly in recent vintage ah presidents have had very little experience uh obviously Eisenhower being an exception with anything in the realm of the military or even service to this country in the military particularly recent Presidents Clinton and Obama and now Trump\n[noise] that is something that is a development that's more it's it's more it's even more true generally in our society for instance if you walk down the streets of Washington D. C. fifty or sixty years ago you would see a lot of people in uniform now that's no longer true that would have also been true\nIn San Francisco even in peacetime that's what's happening to our society\nAnd now with Donald Trump we've got the first president in all of our history two hundred years who has had no governmental experience no military experience any if God Forbid we have a national emergency that threatens war we're going to be in a big National Lab experiment because we cannot predict what's going to happen\nAnd by the way we should mention was general Westmoreland who recommended the use of a new uh when Johnson was president we are talking to Michael Beschloss presidential historian and author of the new book\nPresidents of war he appears Thursday at noon at the commonwealth club here in San Francisco and seven PM at Dominican University in ... with the passage and uh\nWhat about the argument that well presidents aren't declaring war and in fact one thinks about in conjunction with smaller wars are Obama's intervention in Libya or some slamming Syria for that matter but the purse strings are still\nCongress as it's not enough I mean I the whole idea of the constitution was that if you have\nTo go to war Congress for a war declaration there's a debate\nA president has to say this is how long I think this is gonna last this is how many lives are going to be lost this is the strategy I'm going to use\nAnd also Congress has signed onto it the problem if it's just a resolution and that's what president said we easily done since Nineteen forty two forty two was the last war declaration\nUh resolutions were used by LBJ and sixty four George W. Bush for the Gulf War\nA George W. Bush for Iraq and Afghanistan the problem there and we've seen it is that senators for instance who vote for a resolution can say well that was just a resolution to use force if necessary I had not never had in mind that would be a real war\nThe whole point of this is that the best war president in history had been those who have ruthless criticism from members of Congress and also this kind of the debate we've lost that\nWell we go back to Madison for a moment because ah his predecessor Thomas Jefferson managed to avoid that war with England and you could make the argument I think you do\nThat every wars the presidential war and has been since ... and that's what it has\nBecome and the problem here is the president's oftentimes you know do this for fake reasons you know you were talking about poke\nAnd the fake incentives in Texas Eighteen Ninety eight William McKinley a ship it sunk in Havana Harbor or the ... the main and McKinley says we've got to have a big war against Spain largely in revenge for the sinking of our ship\nTurns out the ship was in San ... than it was founded by a boiler accident yes\nMcKinley exploited that for a war that made the United states world power\nYou can argue round or flat where there was a good idea for us to take the Philippines and Guam and Puerto Rico and change the regime and Cuba's and become a world power for the first time but that's what history as it ends versus means you know\nI like the fact that San Francisco is part of the United states and not part of Mexico so the reason that happened was pokes war\nProblem is pokes war was based on allied with a very bad model for later presidents problem here is that you know let's say the Gulf of Tonkin at Nineteen sixty four resolution\nLeading to that big war in Vietnam let's say the the war in Vietnam ended in victory in Nineteen sixty six and we would probably be looking at Lyndon Johnson and certainly what certain ways as a model war president which should

lavish ways [noise]\nWhatever else you think about Brett Kavanaugh he's got the most extreme fringe views of being permissive about powerful presidents of almost anyone who was on Trump's list\nSo why do you think he chose we now have a justice on the Supreme Court the deciding fifth vote a vet conservative majority who not only has those views you know not a president do almost anything he wants but also during the last couple of weeks before his confirmation he became\nYou know very indebted and very much you know bonded to Donald Trump and his people\nThey were devising strategies to get him through the confirmation a Donald Trump is not very shy about making people indebted to him when the Gorsuch his previous nominee was going before the Senate and said something in St Louis critical of Trump Trump set in public you know I can ricin these nominations too\nAnd the other thing that really is very worrisome to me is that we know that Kavanaugh was that the White House you know plotting this confirmation strategy with one of the things that they do is they say tell us your most potentially damaging damaging personal secrets\nSo that we can be prepared for them in case they come out and you have to deal with that I Am not exactly sanguine about the prospect of Donald Trump\nPossibly knowing Brett Kavanaugh knowledge most damaging personal secrets and the prospect that in the near future Brett Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote on a case that determines whether\nYou know Donald Trump Trump continues and the presidency or can use presidential power potentially in a way that's almost dictatorial that makes me very nervous\nAnd if they some more callers on Frank go ahead you're on the air\nYes I'm Wondering about the war Powers Act and why that can't be used

Powers Act that basically says that a president can send in troops but has to justify within a period of time or a number of weeks and if he doesn't do it he has to withdraw the troops\nA lot of damage can be done in that period of time and [noise]\nI don't think it really ultimate Iran's president and also it's sort of the concessions that the Congress has perfectly fine with the ... constitution being violated because the constitution doesn't say anything about that it says you won a major war you've got to come to Congress\nLet me think Frank for his call and move on to another caller and let's go to Hannah ... thanks for winning you're on\nIraq [noise] [noise]\n[noise] why why why\nWhy didn't they didn't [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat's a very important question and I thank you for it I mean you recall I Know Michael during the war in Iraq in the lead up to the war in Iraq there were citizens protesting saying weapons of mass destruction don't exist this is a lie and so forth but it didn't keep us from the floodgates of war\nAnd they turned out to be true and maybe if there had been a real debate in Congress that might've explored how shaky the evidence of weapons of mass mass destruction [noise] really was and you know remember I was talking earlier about some of the worst things the president can do\nIf a president knows that the reason for war is not true and I think the evidence still out on George W. Bush one way or the other\nBut if you how to poke for instance or if you haven't LBJ who knows that the reason for war is ally and yet goes ahead then you've got family members of dead American Soldiers you know for instance because I've I've written so much and LBJ I Can't tell you Michael how many people I have\nRun into it's heartbreaking to who say you know you studied Johnson you study the Vietnam War [noise] please tell me that my family member who died in Vietnam did not die in vain and what do I say\nSixty thousand people probably died this sounds exactly right but how can I possibly say that to someone it's the truth\nWell I think it comes down at least in terms of a kind of a polemic or use that word advisor lead but essentially an argument that the only\nReasons we should go to war on an absolute necessity and other than the support of Congress and the public\nYeah that's well that's my view and it has to be sort of a last resort and I'm really worried if you have a president who sees this as the road to political power popularity is the road to\nYou know ... potentially almost off for a teary and power you know presidents who are waging war you know\nDeclaring martial law for instance that's part of a lot of war plans on using that presidential alert announcement that we talked about a few moments ago that could be an enormous temptation and again I'm not predicting it with Donald Trump but I'm saying it's inevitable that he's going to\nAgain I'm not predicting it with Donald Trump but I'm saying it's inevitable that he's going to be tempted you know let's say six months from now\nHe's in trouble with Robert Mueller and his numbers are falling and he's looking to possibly running for reelection in two thousand twenty and he remembers that war is a short cut that can bring you a lot of dividends and your own power and also politically\nI'm a little nervous about what kind of a decision he might make\nHere is John John you're on the morning\nIt's MORNING Michael thank you vote for all your good work I Want to provide some major push back uh from my ... year old Harry Truman who by the way integrate\nMight minor oh too by the way that's why I'm so disappointed in the small\n... I Want to touch on that please okay I'm a hairy uh integrated the armed forces or when it was not a popular thing to do [noise]\nYou know I I could I could list you ten great things that Truman did but it doesn't mean that he didn't do this\nThat okay but we're going to get out of the Korean War\nIf Harry Truman went\nTo the United nations to get approval yes outta the undeniable [noise] nah a aggression by North Korea I get a real fall totally not Michael give me a second okay Lyndon Johnson\nHad gotten that George Bush had done that we would not have had a war in Vietnam or a war in Iraq so Larry Joe Louis dagger in the same category as the narrative wealth\nWell a George W.

thing is that you know it it in ... case and I agree with you he's my hero too but he did something that was sort of cheap and political and he shouldn't have done it from my point if you\nLet me

the status quo in place and that raises the question well then why do we need proposition eleven and I can talk a little bit about the history of how we got here\nI'd like you to do that because it goes back to a twenty six in California Supreme Court decision\nExactly so in that case it was a case about security guards um who also have to sit stay on call while they're on break and the Supreme Court ruled in that case like basically if you have to stay on call during a break it's not a real break\nWe're getting some important questions here let me just go to them quickly with you a role and then we'll go to our callers Franco's or other first responders employees also on call during breaks\nUm citizens one of the things that the industry is really concerned about public sector employees including public sector and cheese and police um are not that do remain on call during their break\nActually I'm going to go to a caller Sydney because a lot of people are asking the same questions and he's asking a it's a good question should they go ahead you're on the air\nI was wondering why not get salt in the legislature\nAnd indeed that's the question we're hearing from listeners so most recently about April\n[noise] ah I mean I Would ask Jason and and Carol to you to talk about that I mean it sounds like it broke down over these questions of practicality of how you you know determine what's an emergency and also this question of immunity\nWill go to Carol sources she's behind the proposition we also mentioned that uh Carol is currently affiliated with private ambulance for McCormack a Carol talk about if we get\nYes I'm also you know historically a merchant so I I understand how this work the author assembling Rodrigues never put eighty two sixty three up for a final vote\nNo question that this issue should have been resolved by the legislature but we are not able to come to an agreement and as a result the industry are ambulance industry feel very strongly that this is a public safety issue and\nThat the public safety is under threat California if this does not get resolved\nJason ... go ahead please I Would just say that it didn't go to a final floor vote a because this proposition um was authored introduced in and qualified for the ballots that the discussions broke down over the liability piece\nGay that is plain and simple and ... any discussion to the contrary um is is just factually inaccurate\nAnd as a April ... before the liability goes back to a sense we premiums and the payment of not um citizens pockets\nAbsolutely and again like I said in the very beginning we agree with that the the margins reimbursement rates are make it very difficult if not impossible for providers to add that twenty five percent\nWhich is why we were seeking a collaborative solution through the legislature to create the carve out not only to the wage order but to the Augustus ruling and the affirmation of off duty meal period because it's not a political for EMS in the private sector another caller joining us with us here on fire\nOh hold on one ... excuse me Harold I'm going to go to a caller in here and then I'll get your response Monique ahead\nHi I'm a physician and I I I recognize the spirit of wanting to have people available but honestly if you're on hold on your break you're not having a break my professional feeling and the experience that that would compromise safety more and\nIt it costs more than we had it for for fighting ... hey that that now it's not fair and not ate about ... ... ... at the profession and the professional that they are to make them work through breaks\nAnd kill more that's where I wanted to go to Carly could answer that but also you can go back to what you wanted to or needed to be so\nAbsolutely we want and chasing paramedics to get their break we also want them to be there when the public called nine one one\nBreak your not having a break my personal feeling and experience is that that will compromise safety more and it\nIt costs more than we had if I have to pay that that now it's not fair and not being able to ... as a profession and the professional that they are to make them work through breaks\nThan to them or that's what I wanted to go to the caller answer them but also you can go back to what you wanted to or needed to be so\nAbsolutely we want and chasing paramedics to get their break we also want them to be there when the public called nine one one\nSo what this does is it ensures that the EMTs and paramedics get their break in most cases and in sixty percent of the time\nThey are actually in down time now that means you know that does it mean every day some days are go go go and and in fact this requires if they don't get their breaks they get paid for their break\nSo I think that we do believe in EMTs and paramedics getting their break and that is what our systems do every day as much as possible when that's not possible just like fire and police when the public needs us we need to be there\nAnd they are going to be compensated ... right\nCorrect correct but we're we're spending a lot of time talking about a topic that we mutually agree on\nYes on duty meal periods for private sector EMS providing a public safety service is needed there's other avenues to have this what this initiative does in section eight eight eight is limits the liability of the private sector company for\nAlleged past violations understanding wage order that's what does she live Kay going forward but it's not okay going back well I I don't see I imagine individual but it Hi Laurie\nYou're both talking the same time uh she's concerned about uh your most concerned about how the retroactive fits into this new thing Jason why not well we were willing\nTo provide a mar the retroactive immunity of any new lawsuits that would be filed and perspective immunity moving forward but\nI as an individual representing four thousand providers in his state of California do not have the sole authority to take away the rights of another individual or individuals in the state of California\nTo take away their ability to seek a mediation during the civil process for grievances from their employer\nHarshly taking away ... pretty much emotion if you have the return to them\nNow I don't know a lot of the details of these lawsuits that I like I said I'm a nurse or Iran and end up system so I'm not privy to the exact details of these lawsuits but I Know that some cases have already been settled felt a lot of this as the\nLet me get another call here just a good joining us Jessica welcome you're on the air\nUm does from Oakland and I um I just wanted to say there are as someone who actually this is why would they bark versus Bernard\nThis year ah there were two blocks away from me I Would really really great that people need first responder to be available at all times I think that that's a professional game just like doctor that you just kind of know going in that you're not going to have\nNecessarily the right time and also I Do wonder if it's really an issue as far as like are there\nAre there in the ... image people who are not getting breaks or is it just um if there aren't enough the empty or something like that maybe there are enough of them um and if there are something that we need to do about ... having more people do that profession but I don't think that we should\nBe worried about giving them break but I really don't because I mean I'd be dead if it weren't for if it weren't for the people that they ...\nJust going to appreciate hearing from you and I thank you for the call what about understand seniors use and blues and the problem\nIs a it's a state wide problem\nAnd what about this uh let me go back to you Steve roads driving coach three in traffic and making split second medical decisions well hungry and exhausted use the public safety issue sufficient sensing to ensure appropriate shuffling shift links breaks a meal times is how you enhanced public safety\nWell and there is a component up this proposition that requires the providers to have sufficient staffing levels so I agree I think that you know they ... should get their breaks I was\nA nurse in an emergency room and there were many times that I didn't get breaks and that doesn't mean that\nYou're on the top but the bottom line is is that if your the person that's in your home and you know three blocks down there is somebody it's Starbucks is having a break and it's going to take\nEight minutes for somebody to get to your to you and you're having a heart attack you ... percent the calm weather then that on their break or not\nMaybe we'll let me go back to you a junior wants to know why it's probably been only apply to property in Tucson paramedics\nAnd it's a the the law is different for the public sector and um the the Supreme Court ruling was\nIs this specifically to private companies and then it's a unique thing within the ambulance industry that as you mentioned at the top of the hour that I'm Seventy five percent of nine one one calls are responding 'em by these private industry\nLet me think April Dembosky who's getting used to go to the super thank you and thanks for Jason ... here in Studio ... executive director of the United ... workers thank you for being Romesha and thanks to you a colonel martyr former director of Los Angeles county emergency medical services agency [noise]\nIt's my pleasure thank you very much and thanks you are listening\nServices agency my pleasure thank you very much\nAnd thanks to you our listeners are sorry for those you waiting on the line who couldn't get through it but we're going to have another half hour we're going to have it with ah Michael imperial league remember that name from the Sopranos [noise]\nThe ... very much so um you know I had I just did a movie where I played governor Andrew Cuomo in New York and uh so I got to meet him\nAnd we had a long conversation about this it's the movies about a prison break that happened in New York a couple of years ago but that\nWe talked a long time about what he did in the prison break why it was important why had to do what he did and then at the end of it and it was great the end of the conversation he brought up as Mario ... this is Andrew this is very recently\nAnd then he at the end of the conversation goes you know my father he goes I've never watch the Sopranos and my father never saw the godfather because and I said I Know where you're going and let me say that [noise]\nAh the Sopranos was not not met mentor represents the entire Italian American experience my father was a bus driver it's a show about outlaws and gangsters\n[noise] that said\nAll so I think a really great work of art that was you know generated by an Italian American David Chase who didn't who you know whose family changed their name generations before because of a love affair gone awry had nothing to do with the mafia or anything\nAnd I said you know you ... I think most Italian Americans that it's probably is very loving to them and they have memories of it when it was first on the air of making pasta and watching it on Sunday nights and um [noise]\nI think most people understood its place in entertainment and culture and even in a literary sense and that you know those concerns about stereotypes were much more an issue early on in the immigration experience\nIt's also I think a really great work of art that was you know generated by an Italian American David Chase who didn't who you know whose family changed their name generations before because of a love affair gone awry had nothing to do with the mafia or anything\nAnd I said you know you ... I think most Italian Americans that this is very loving to them and they have memories of it when it was first on the air of making pasta and watching it on Sunday nights and um\nI think most people understood its place in entertainment and culture and even in a literary sense and that you know those concerns about stereotypes were much more an issue early on in the immigration experience Italians of assimilated very very much into\nThe fabric of all American life from politics and law and art\nAnd everything so that's my defense and two cents or whatever it's worse well [noise] it's your defense [laughter] for shade\nBut he got what I was saying yeah we we we had a common ground and I said you should see it and just look at it for that purpose and he said okay\nLet me invite listeners to join us if you have a question or comment from Michael imperial you if you were a fan of the Sopranos if you want to talk about Lou Reed or ask him about his new novel\nThe perfume burned desire burned his eyes please feel free to join us and you can do that at our toll free number and be part of the program the number to call his eight six six seven three three six seven eight six and you can join us now again by calling in at eight six six seven three three six seven eight six you can also of course email is\nForum at ... dot org or go to our website and post questions or comments there can be de dot org slash forum or tweet us our Twitter handle is at ... for them and uh let's hear it cuts from the Sopranos or\nThis is actually a a kind of having to do with the Chris for wanting to be made man\nI'm not going to pay [noise] but yeah\nI'm Serious serious is what happens if you don't pay by my head\nIn my thoughts I use the technique of positive visualization how come I always feel undermined by what I did on the tribe or a tower situation alone I should have been made right then boom\nSnow can serious Tony the books are close did you talk the Jackie about me\nThey're not accepting any new members okay [noise]\nYou know [noise] he had a reputation for immaturity\nBut I wanted people here that could not only a get a little on the subject with of the Sopranos especially for those like me who really appreciated it and uh this whole serious and watch it from the beginning\nBut also you did kind of become a made man when are you fell over in that scene that I alluded to before was being shot by a joke ... I mean I got there was a lot of blood and you've got your hands prices liked\nMy I've seen that gets shot and I had a glass in my hand and when I hit the ground the glass split open to all my fingers so I had to be rushed to the hospital in Queens\nAnd uh I had bullet holes in my chest and blood everywhere\nSo when they saw me at the hospital they rushed me into ... on a stretcher and I was trying to tell them that it was my fingers and that I was in the movie but they thought it was delirious and\nWouldn't listen to me and find until they finally started cutting open my shirt and solve the square being and wires and stuff had to do a few ... cuts after that to a wild than they thought was in fact my fingers and put me in a corner to wait for three hours until they reach me up and then I went back and\nDid a few more tanks after that you you had\nCertainly a good line there because that's what happens when the guys are made men right it gets because they make blood by picking his fingers\nThat I always thought drew a parallel that you know when you were made into the mob they pick your finger and they take your blood and they put it on a picture of a saint and then they burn it so to me it was kind of a ritual being an Italian American actor being in a Martin Scorsese movie with Robert De Niro getting my fingers cut in a mafia movie was kind of my initiation into\nThat world well those are the actors you compare working with to playing for the Yankees [laughter] this kind of the many leagues and oh yeah\nFor me as a kid in New York kid and ... and ... you know to be an actor and starting out the those are you in those guys have tightened you know those are your hero so ... and I had done a couple of little roles in movies and a little place and it's yeah it's akin to going from\nCollege baseball to all of a sudden you're you know you're playing in the world series with the Yankees literally was was that\nTo a question from a listener named Jeff he wants to know can you talk about Lou Reid's seemingly hostile attitude toward the media versus the love and respect the engendered in his friends was little bitter well\nI think he was ... he you know people when he started out he was always asked about\nDrugs and the underworld and the I think the uh the nightlife world I mean that you know that I think\nHe felt he was defined by that by the media rather than just about his art and about his music and about poetry and about things that he really loved and he I think he just felt like the people these people are never going to understand who I Am so I'm not sure I'm I'm not going to entertain\nThey're pigeonholed view of me that's at least what I think and it kinda snowballed from the air over the years\nAnd a question from a listener named Craig or what the hell was mad dogs about besides an excuse to hang out and belief for a few months [noise]\nMad dogs was I think about friendship\nCan\nSolve a pithy enough [laughter]\nUltimately you know in about ... how far you'd go for friendship and what are the boundaries of friendship and uh\n[noise] um yeah\nOver time you know friendships from college and now you're in middle age and and how much of those friendships are really a a resonate in the present uh how much value them in the present how far would you go for your friends I think that's what it's about Spike Lee a friend oh yeah I've worked for like six times\nI think that's what it's about Spike Lee a friend\nOh yeah I've worked at like six times since going back to Nineteen eighty nine\nI remember interviewing him and a little perfectly but we got on okay after a fashion but uh he was very adamant about the fact that at the time that he thought people he hired should be African American and he was talking about how many people behind the scenes but people on the set and so forth activists well\nAt the time when he started making films a\nThere was a lot of there wasn't a lot of African Americans in in you know important positions on the crew particularly you know there there were some filmmakers but [noise]\nUm he just felt they they needed to be represented more and and especially because he was telling for a large part stories about African Americans but\nUm what is interesting was when we did some or Sam\nI'm which is more about there are some African right there was predominantly about Italian Americans\nAs ours have had to do with David Berkowitz David Berkowitz empire annoying that happened around in the ... in the Bronx particularly in some neighborhoods where killings were happening the paranoia that people started looking at each other and looking at their neighbors thinking who's the killer kind of thing but um\nBy then I mean this is Nineteen we shot that in I guess Ninety\nEight so he had you know he had been committed\nTo his mission for a long time um\nOriginally I was going to direct that movie and he was going to executive producer but we we couldn't get that sold so he decided to direct it and there was a great production designer named her as depressed who who passed away a who did I shot Andy Warhol on some great and I have I did during that three minutes or\n... and I shut 'em around that time you know and and a and a wonderful cinematographer named Ellen tourists who I wanted to use when I was going to direct it and he hired both of them and they were white women\nSo obviously he he you know was not just that you know he he was he became open to just being [noise] ...\nYou know once I think his mission was engaged she felt like he can just find the right person for the job and he felt as I did that those two people were really right for this particular piece of material so he's not just you know narrow minded as as far as that goes on I think I think he's a great American artist to be honest\nWe're talking with Michael imperial Lee or did you see uh the new film I haven't seen it yet I haven't been to the movie that was a high recommendation for

as part of our election twenty Eighteen coverage we're going to hear from both sides on proposition ... and the debate and joining us now here in Studio ... to help flesh out what is all about that is what proposition tends to hold on just kicking the reporter guy mess running guy welcome more to Michael in the morning to you will also welcomed Brian Augusta who represents\nThe yes on prop ten campaign and he's director of the California rural legal assistance foundation good to have you Brian and goes to\nThank you Michael and also good to have pets able house who also joins us for the debate or do we have guy flesh things out for his paw and pets able house or represents the no on ten campaign he's also executive director of the California counsel for affordable housing that's able house welcome\nThank you very much Michael and now that we're all assembled let me go to guy Maserati and a guy let's talk about what is in this I mean essentially you were talking about local control\nAbsolutely I think that's a really easy a good way to think about this for the vast majority of California cities\nThis is about local control if you don't have a rent control on the books if proposition tend were to pass\nThese cities would suddenly have the power to enact rent control limit rent increases on the local level something that the state has largely banned for the last few decades\nNow for the Fifteen or so cities that have rent control laws on the books it's not all about look control it's there's actually some things that could happen right away if proposition and passes you know some laws that have been kind of frozen for decades suddenly rent control ordinance that become active again\nBecause of ... which this would repeal or was passed by one vote back in Nineteen Ninety five but\nWe've had rent control ordinances are which are in effect for example in Berkeley has gone to the trouble of actually putting another proposal in in the event that proposition ten passes\nAbsolutely I think they're Berkeley's kind of far ahead of other bay area cities on this they have a plan in place as you mentioned if prop ... passes\nThey have a measure on their ballot or you know that voters would have to vote separately on locally that kind of maps out a post ... ten\nRent control future for the city basically setting a rent levels right now with a new base line and then easing buildings into rent control that is buildings that would age on their twentieth birthday so to speak with suddenly become eligible for rent control\nOr and and and that's why or even the public housing authorities association of California are are opposed to prop ten because there's there's no carve out for them uh and so we we think are another regulatory a restriction\nOn people that are involved in developing affordable housing or will will serve are no good purpose it's just another layer of monitoring right now\nThe the the five hundred thousand low income housing tax credit units or or or rent restricted by by the federal department of housing and urban development in the treasures office here in the state\nThose projects are monitored ah each and every year to make sure that they're serving people that are that make no more than sixty percent of area median income and and we don't need a another a regulatory an impediment to be imposed on\nDevelopers that have a a a difficult time now with nimby ism uh in in other opponents of affordable housing at the local jurisdiction\nLet me say with this for a moment with your pet because I'm ... UC Berkeley housing researcher uh did some day they got some data on six of area cities and\nUh it turns out that with rent control there was more housing produce per capita a between two thousand seven to ten thousand Thirteen um then without\n\nI I I I I I don't know the statistics are Michael I don't I don't know ah ah if that is the case or not I I I trust that she she did a good research on this but it was my understanding that uh\nThe rent control in in local jurisdictions that Fifteen or so that you mentioned earlier on the program\nA causes a people at the at the local level that that have just a single family unit or two that they're renting out uh to uh to basically want to take that that unit off the market because they don't they they simply don't want to go through the regulatory process that ah that rent control brings on\nNow let me go back to you on this or buying Augusta because there's a risk or of course as you pointed out of uh making vulnerable families lose their homes or but there's also make people being displaced I mean this is a serious crisis in may in many people's minds beat of number one crisis in the state of California but\nIf you if if you have a well rental units taken off the market because uh landlords don't like the fact that there's rent control or and you have perhaps a slow down and housing construction as we've been talking on the table house it's sort of antithetical to what you hope for isn't it\nWell let's talk about that and I want to address that point if I could quickly go back to a couple of points that pat has made\nNumber one um\nIf you look at who's supporting yes on ten most of the state wide and regional affordable housing groups that policy experts have been working on how to solve our affordable housing prices are low income people are supporting prop dad so I Want to make sure that your listeners are clear that this is an important\nYour listeners are clear that this is an important policy that I'm affordable housing experts support this notion about carving out a deed restricted affordable units\nEvery or California addresses that and that's an issue to be addressed at the local level and they and they have an exemption for the subsidized restriction affordable housing like what\nMr stabilizes talking about so that's I Believe that's a non issue with respect to prop tend 'em with respect to the production of affordable housing and housing overall you a\nReference to study earlier and it it does it confirms that I'm In the three largest bay area cities with rent control San Francisco San jose in Oakland\nWho only have twenty percent of the region's housing in that time period between\nA two thousand and two whiny Seventeen forty three percent\nThey built forty three percent of the new unit so they're producing affordable housing West Hollywood which has rent control has met every portion of its state mandated um housing production goals so\nRent control is not an impediment to the production of housing and it's not an impediment to the production of affordable housing\n[noise] um add to this question of um [noise]\nWhat does it do to sort of housing picture in a city um we know that when in cities average control it helps keep rents alone not obviously just for those folks who live in a rent controlled unit but it also helps keep prices low overall in the market several studies have have demonstrated that as well\nAs you say a pet said well how about a little proposition ten is not the answer to fix the housing shortage what is\nWe we think that uh in in in war we're putting our efforts into supporting a proposition one to four billion dollar bond issue in a proposition too which is the two billion dollar bond issue for for homelessness we think\nThat's where our effort should should be going if a if we're going to ... if we're going to deal with with what we we think and what the economists think is a is a supply problem or in terms of what a um\nIt was just said about um uh Brian just said about the uh the production of affordable housing and places like Berkeley or or West Hollywood\nA ... yes that that may very well be the case because if affordable housing is Brian said is is carved out from the rent control a initiative at the local level then then it's not going to be an impediment to to produce affordable housing in in those is a\nA rent controlled cities but but it could be in in in other arenas or if you're if you're talking about mixed income housing that the California housing Finance Agency\nIs is advocating a in a big way in terms of how they're going to use a Senate bill to a set of Dr Atkins bill that is the real estate tax that will produce a\nAbout two hundred and fifty million ah this this ah this first year in twenty Nineteen uh in in California housing Finance Agency is using his share of that money\nTo support the development of the\nOf mixed income housing which ah consist of a of a number

D public radio on Michael Krasny\nMm\n[noise]\nWhich is to keep in mind that when prop ... passes if the voters passed robbed and\nAll it does is restore the authority to local voters and local governments to consider additional policies and records from a policy that they don't currently have\nBut before the real estate industry pass the costs of Hawkins act and limited a local discretion around does issue we know what local voters did not mogul voters in every jurisdiction to California\nFor example with no a direction from the state legislature enacted rent control policies that exempted new construction\nMany of them adopted policies that provide that exemption for owner occupied housing or for certain forms of single family housing and there's a split among this issue of vacancy control Saddam had vacancy controls some did not so there's really no reason to assume that if we put\nA that we if we pass prop ten and restore the authority of local voters to make these choices\nProp ten and restore the authority of local voters to make these choices that they will do something different than they did when they enacted these policies ... Hawkins\nWhat we'll do is give a lot more flexibility for cities to consider their particular needs what is the housing stock in that particular city and how should we apply if we decided to adopt their rent control policy is there some\nHybrid version of vacancy control that would be a that works better than our city right now they're handcuffed they can't make those decisions because the state has for has intervened for decades and tell them they can and now it's time to give that piece back\nTo local decision makers to make decisions in this housing crisis that are tied to what is happening in their city\nI Want to bring more colors aboard we go next to Stephanie in Santa Rosa good morning\nMy all my craft and I I don't think about retirement and I guess by the time I found out and cannot credit carpet ranking out pipe line where it's pretty high in fat rents cutting Hi I'm not\nGoing to make a profit on Iran via canal equity um first hour later how I rent rent control affect pay rent it made my right at that I don't quite a while I got a lot and I like\nTo direct question you want to answer that I'm\nSure I mean I should say Santa Rosa there's been local efforts to put in place rent control in the local level in recent years that have failed so you know in in your case specifically Santa Rosa has no rent control law\nI'm On the books you know that the council or you know and our mission if could make that happen in the future but you know once this election is certified hypothetically if proposition ... were to pass nothing would change immediately in Santa Rosa\nAnd let me thank you for the call Catherine and we'll go right to an assassin excuse me who write to another caller and that's Eric Harris joins us\nOn high thank you uh uh my name's Derek and um you know I just call it a a a just a ... well how common to put up the um\nThe hypocrisy um that I feel is being set forth by the opposing prop ten side a and it echoes what we just heard from Brian ... and that it that you know the idea is to allow local governments\nTo make decisions a Republican legislature signed a peak David put into place caught the hockey and we just don't contrary to what they normally preach the idea that like local government it's got to be the head of state uh making decisions and always thinking they do tend\nTo allow local governments to make a decision and that the population in the government don't like it they of course can make changes to their local government and make changes to the decision so it's really\nA ... off in a conservative idea which is to not have government overriding a over a large overriding the decision\nOf local government and I I think that there's a lot of misinformation about that um I think that's kind of the clarity that people\nHere let me thank you for the call and go right to pass Sable ... what would you say there and sorry among pat\nI'm I Am I Am sympathetic to ah to what you're saying about about local control it except to the fact that the local governments are throughout California in many instances that have not function effectively with regard to dealing with this\nThis shortage of of of multi family housing specifically a ... you you look at the he talked about state laws being\nImposed upon local jurisdictions in in in some cases that was that was a central because local governments wouldn't wouldn't take it deal with the problem and hand ah in in one a good a good example of that is when the housing element law of the general plan was [noise] was passed a some twenty five years\nAgo that it that imposed upon local government ... the requirement that they had to to to determine what kind of housing needs they were facing in their jurisdiction and then they had to lay out a plan and find a enough sites are properly zoomed in in order to be able to have developers come in\nAnd develop both single family multi family housing and in many instances even today you have local jurisdictions that are that are not complying with the uh the housing element a requirement of their of their local a local\nA general plan they're they're just not doing the job so uh in in some instances local control of works very well and in other instances you you have to have the state stepped in\nAnd in and require demand local governments do their fair share of of ah of making housing available in their jurisdiction as opposed to passing it on to the to the jurisdiction next door\nAnd let me think for the call them as running was\nYeah it was just going to say it's it's it's a pendulum you know the ... the for years you know the state\nUh you know in recent years the state legislature has concluded that local governments have not done enough to support the construction of of housing so they've stripped tower from local governments now we see\nYou know rental advocates saying the state government has not done enough to address rental issues that they're seeking to get power back to the local level so I you know I Do think this is a pendulum has swung back and forth over time\nAnd we're going to go to more cause for a couple of tweets though in guy let me go to you and these are listeners tweets and the argument is that rent control is to provide immediate relief to the housing crisis and why not place a time limit on it\nAnd I think you're going to see some cities unlikely do that you know I think ... cities may introduce we already see Berkeley doing this but put kind of a time limit that says you know new can we don't want to discourage\nImmediate development we don't want to scare away developers who we are going to put a time limit to say maybe a buildings cannot be rent controlled for their first Fifteen year for the first twenty year for the first Thirty years to try to give developers a you know to not give them a way to say you're they're going to have an ability to make back profits within the first couple of decades\nAnd Scott wants to do with ... prevent the state from ever again an acting laws related to rent control without first seeking voter approval\nSponsorship of the cake you mean the live stream

be protecting ... renders and people who\nAre just trying to have some stability or is it people who are uh landlords I agree that they should be able to make a share returned but that's already protected\nBy law well does it come down to that new judgments ... must be very I mean are you from the tendency for the landlord life think even more specific way she may in fact I was just looking at some numbers is with sixty percent of right here in San Francisco or\nLiving in rent control well yeah I mean right and I think even more specifically when we talk about right control is really for current renters there's the you know the research has been done that says you know if you are passed rent control your possibly preventing future renters from having an affordable housing stock\nAt the rental level but who you're really helping or people in homes you know currently um who who are at risk of being priced out things about seniors on fixed income\nOn people who were really close to being kind of on the edge when it comes to housing that's who rent control would help you know right away if prop Denver to pass in many jurisdictions um and then in others you know you'd have to wait for local action\nTo actually over sixty percent by the way I think that uh let me think the caller and move on to more calls actually move on to a comment first\nTime since I Lived in Berkeley for Eighteen years old I benefited from rent control but it doesn't really work except for people who are already entrenched in their apartments if you're in a rent controlled rumor apartment you never leave the kind of people who benefits a mostly white collar professions who can pay for their own home repair\nYeah I think that's the you know a fair criticism because there is no means testing for rent control right like you you uh if you're in a rent controlled apartment I'm you may not necessarily be low income and there is no incentive to leave 'em you know that works for people who are you know like I said maybe on a fixed income\nBut again if you're let's say you're a single senior living in a three bedroom apartment you may not need a three bedroom apartment but you're certainly not
