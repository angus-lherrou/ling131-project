nomination an investigation is Ryan Lucas justice correspondent for NPR welcome Ryan looms look it's good to have you\nThank you for having me I guess the place to begin as a sorting out what are the FBI has been given in the way of its marching orders here I mean certainly they come from the White House but uh there's reports it was very limited in scope and other reports of the the president's tweet is free rein help us [noise]\nUh well unfortunately there isn't a lot of clarity on this and and it's important to understand first off how these investigations work one this is not a criminal investigation is has a background check investigation\nUh and it is the FBI that conducts these at the behest of the White House they work in a sense of the contractor for the White House or in the White House really does it get to decide what the parameters of that investigation is going to look like\nI'm so if if the White House says we want you to look at a doctor for delegations and Deborah Ramirez has invested in a allegations but we don't want you to look at uh the allegations that a third woman named Julie sweat Nick I'm has made\nAt uh the allegations that a third woman named really sweat Nick\nI'm has made than the White House technically has the ability to do that now what the White House has said so far what Sarah Sanders said yesterday the White House press secretary for example\nUm is that she's not aware of any limitations that have been put on this or the FBI is to look at uh what it needs to that Senate Republicans who are deciding a specifically what they want\n'em so we don't have a lot of clarity at this point uh I can say that I'm Deborah Ramirez who made allegations about a sexual misconduct\nOr by Brett Kavanaugh back in the early eighties while she was at a Yale as well as a Cavanaugh I'm that she spoke to the FBI yesterday\nUm and gave them a number of uh witnesses to the alleged incidents and people who heard about it uh contemporaneously so I'm the FBI has started moving forward but as far as the exact Brett ah of the investigation at this point it's very hard to say\nThere were reports though that the FBI was a limited for example could not go to the Safeway where mark ... who was apparently at least according to Christine Blasey Ford's testimony a part of the sexual assault or the cheese charged or\nYou had a whole group on his part the whole group is in one man credibly accused by not one but three women of sexual assault and\nThe the the group on the other side is women saying you need to take these these are stories and these allegations seriously um I mean his yes he might lose his job on on the DC circuit court um if if the country believe that he is\nA both credibly accused of sexual sexual assault and also revealed himself to be a partisan in a way that no other I'm no other justice um nominee has done before\nYou know nobody is accused Neil Gorsuch a sexual assault no women know yell classmates no prep school classmates he was the same prep school is Kevin ... nobody's come forward about him I'm no Democrats\nNo no I wasn't going to have sorry again I just have to repeat that in your in your statement there you're conflated to things and issue about partisanship which I think it's\nPerfectly legitimate as far as it's sitting next to sit on the Supreme Court but then also in an active sexual assault which is the RAVE Act of misconduct subject to criminal penalties and I don't think you can get a flight but you honestly wonder and the other are very very very significant and drink\nAnd when we began to say okay well I Hope this guy because he has struggled judicial philosophy with which I disagree but also he's probably a serial falter\nAnd that's ... that's not what I said what I said is that he revealed I uh uh he displayed a sense of partisanship different than being a conservative jurists um when he accuses some sort of vast left wing Clinton led conspiracy for trying to keep them off the bench\nThat's just that's just black helicopter talk I mean that's just crazy I'm ... and you didn't just lay the temperament and talking to you and me closer to shore um you know asking for the child of an alcoholic out drunk you know I mean this was this was not a good performance except for the audience of one for him it was intended\nAnd let me change if I may with you know are awesome because uh you you even says with the Democrats won here in your article you said as a confession and they're probably not going to get it because he has too much to lose whether he's telling the truth or not but there's a real question about his veracity and as far as it should those are real factors in this whole confirmation are they not know that more\nA part of conservative absolutely or a factor here and I like the fact that Democrats have said that pretty solid ground so much despair that are a part of the judges don't confirmable although that would render quite a few jobs which has already gone to court\nBut this is my man I just got racial hearings who she said I'm a partial I'm like an empire unlike an empire I mean how do you balance that with the snake ... strikes yeah\nRight well the problem here with the idea that a justice should be impartial in the face of allegations involving his own conduct potentially criminal conduct for strikes me as an unrealistic and like you should be nonpartisan and the fate of accusations of being involved in a gang rape\nA group um seems to me to be unrealistic to the point of denying the fact that we have refusal process women judges are personally involving cases they are to withdraw themselves for those cases um and again we're we conflate any idea\nThat the individual can serve on the court and have a partisan views which by the way it is a rather common practice where what our again criminal allegations that you think we have to make a giant distinction between those\nTwo they're not allowed to gauge it in but if you were hiring an intern and one person was accused of sexual assault credibly and another was not you would hire the section [laughter] I mean it's not a yard and you would go to the police on the other one\nUh you you got a job and you might I mean you might not have standing and you're in you know I mean I I think again to to try and say that this nice to meet a criminal trial standard is crazy and that's particularly crazy\nYou're not willing to do a serious investigation so when he was asked when Kevin\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October fifteenth MLA dot Stanford di di di you\nKnow rather than the scope of this has been somewhat limited in and really constrained\nWell according to New York times or we don't have any evidence that this has been constrained by the White House and it would not be a comment if that were the case start for the executive branch to limit\nThe scope it which I Would have seven background investigation into a if a judge Kavanaugh was conducted I again we have no evidence the data for those who are making that claim at all do credit by the way I'm tiered justice correspondent who said earlier I Believe\nThat that notion that you perjured himself and that by the way up there with the federal one way or the other about bereft effect\nOn the Senate will say one way or the other whether or not they believe ... district for the family of course part of that for example that he had testified that he never passed out that it's not true is that I went to sleep quote unquote when he got to fight under oath that its colloquially\nHappening out when he started by never locked out and a lot of people had to say okay well that is really unlikely an unrealistic given what we know about his drinking history for customers for his friend ... interviews or what have you and that's perfectly natural and fine and the conclusion that I think I agree with\nBut that does that mean we perjured himself with his parents you're not say anything to the contrary\nI alluded to President Trump saying at a press conferences is just minutes ago he was answering a question on whether the White House has imposed limits on the FBI investigation and here's what he said\nMy White House will do whatever the senators want\nI'm open to whatever they want the one thing I Want to speed now this is the sevens investigation of judge Kavanaugh number seven this is number one\nThey started on friday they worked all weekend they've gone late into the evenings the FBI's really working hard\nWell they're discouraging for you I mean the president said would we just heard from Nell Rodman seven investigations\nWell I mean that is completely disingenuous because when you go to a normal background check the the as I said effects that um\nThat Ryan was referring to before I mean they do they call a few associates some of the food names you provide to them they said you know they do the sort of basic due diligence and if nothing pops up on their radar you know you kind of pass through your background check and you move on\nBut as we saw with Rob Porter if something does pop up\nLike credible sexual assault claims or a credible claims of domestic violence than they dig deeper so you know we can talk about whether or not judge Kavanaugh's previous background checks were sufficient but at this point we have credible accusations of sexual assault\nCredible a accusations of certainly not telling the truth to Congress and not just about drinking and the ... there was also you know sort of dirty tricks and other other things that he completely dissemble about\n'em but you know so now we'll see if the FBI is is empowered 'em to do an actual investigation that the country desperately

minute left here but could you just address the whole question that I brought up earlier about\nUm the the um ... case it's a on the docket I'm Talking about gamble versus the United states [noise]\nYeah I I'm not sure what the traditional philosophy is regarding that any I heard the case before him either if I don't think it's appropriate to prejudge\nA case like hearing the merits of the arguments and that's probably something that I think Democrats are not going to accept they'd rather hear a philosophical opposition to what is going to be before the court but that's also not to do a do justice to the individuals who are involved in that case they're argument to be heard before there was German\nAnd your thoughts about what you just heard from a from a large effort quickly if\nThe guy every with Claire that I think the Senate is looking for some sort of covers either have a smoking gun here that's got all the nomination in order to have a cigarette break having a clear to not is not what they're going to be presented with senators are going to have to make the call\nAnd when they do is going to alienate millions of people on either side of this divide there were just going to be postponing the condition of you know I we were out of weeks ago\nI think you've called it a zero sum game well we'll hear from our listeners when we return on Michael Krasny\n[noise]\nComing up we've gotten more uh forums and stay with us but first let's go see if there are any traffic problems on the road with kidney with strum\nActually acted Anthony ... good hearted Ginny ... start things off in Fremont where the cleanup continues after an earlier action in South down eighty eighty right at the total road ...\nThree car accidents one of the cars knocked down a light also the clean up their continues ... made a time\nWhen you have this wrapped up in a wrapped up in looks like that ran is currently shut down San jose first reports of an accident south bound to waiting Winchester already seen a little bit of slow traffic there and for the East Bay back to the east make rocket accident involving a car in a band fortunately both onto the shoulder eastbound eighty\nThe treatment of the individual and the notion that you can all somehow just get rid of him and replace him with another justice after the corruption up its process but it's actually a band and again and and beaming him having been a partner at that evidence suggesting that you think age and gross sexual misconduct and sexual assault\nAnd it'd be I'm corroborated rumors and they are absolutely uncorroborated there is no pretty temperate if corroborated witness who can say these things happened or even that they were there a then you can say okay this can happen just about anybody any allegation even back in childhood when you're a minor\nCan be summed up and eat without substantiate evidence can uh can ruin a reputation or otherwise sterling legal career and it's not as though that's going about establishing president conservative record by that so yeah maybe a couple of weeks ago Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there a guy\nThen one in eighty Coney Barrett or whoever rather justice is on the federal worthless but he's the guy now and it doesn't have anything to do with their judicial philosophy\nOn Iraq and the freshly ended up being established no residents associate editor of commentary I Want to get another caller border Carolyn joined us here on the air\nYeah hello Hi so taking my call and I'm so I'm here's my point I'm ... why the White House and the key not allow a whole and unfettered investigation critics charge\n'em why um\nWhy limited what got a lot who's going to be investigated and we're we're we're going to let the scope of this go eat what kind of have an investigation like normal people in the United states yet when they're charged with the bomb in one of the things we just had a very prominent man walked\nInto partisan west\nOn a lot of on\nSubstantiated um because of the statute of limitations and not having 'em some critical evidence walked into jail why can't we have an unfettered investigation one story of us myself included how can a salt pulled\nOur lifetimes one tweet winning so I don't see warning shots across conservative men spouse once we have a son or hearing about it\nHave bother hearing about this for others have goals ... grandfather had boy when I hear about this\nAnd they're taking it personal and it is not about women's sabotaging entitled men who are you hearing about it and they are the are drinking man yeah football watching men and they are upset\nAnd they want to hear from you\nAs well as the women ... thank you\nThank you for that state manure rather than response\n[laughter] yeah I I hear this legitimate and searing pain in the voice and I believe that her and I believe that something happened to her and I believe that there were there to check that one and three million or why don't treat women have suffered or this kind of dignity and youth\nAnd that the we're in the middle of a societal recognizing\nThat has been a about the private institutions that have shielded men in powerful position from the responsibilities what you do that should be taken for their actions from the consequences however\nIt is a grave injustice to do collective recruit you have justice to a man based on the allegations against other man\nThis is about an individual and look is about a crime and by the way he has not been charged with anything\nBecause their investigation into the gentleman background yes and it could have legal exposure at the end of the day but right now it is purely an investigation interviewing witnesses and the witnesses testimony for going to be critical to the Senate walk with a up or down whether or not they think\nPartnering with evidence suggests Brett Kavanaugh in engaged in criminal activity now getting getting prosecuted but it is still criminal activity and so this man and his two young daughters minors and his wife will have the reputation of permanently ruins\nSo the stakes are very serious for these individuals and that is that that's what's in the balance here real genuine justice for either Dr Ford\nOr rec having our and his family and that's why it is here are some game somebody is going to win here and someone is going to lose that whoever comes out of this one way or the other up or down millions of people are going to feel like that caller just still\nWhile I'm lettering against women are not to be believed and that is a grave injustice\nApropos what you just said let me go to Jeffrey on this uh Roger calling from New York Times you might as soon as the millions of Americans saw this unfold as an upstanding middle aged judge and his family victims of gender politics and uh the me too revolution\nAnd aren't really have anything to say that this is Roger Cohen's yeah million side I mean obviously you didn't see it that way\nBut I'm probably right about millions of\nMy I I don't know I don't see that I see I see conservative columnist talking about that and trying to sleep stand the flames of that but I'm not seen some great hue and cry that I mean most men\nDo not sexually abused women and therefore they're not afraid of being accused of sexually abusing women\nWomen have been around men who um you know plenty of women who have been around men who are drinking and um those men don't attack them you know\nJust sort of say let anybody can be accused ... is just another way of saying boys will be boys this man is being accused for things that she specifically um is alleged to have done and\nWe need to look at that and I'm Sorry like it it you know on the one side there is Brett Kavanaugh and his family and his career\nOn the other side there's not just because she left before there is\nOne in three American women who had been raped or severely sexually assaulted those women are not just Democrats and they're not just liberals\nAnd I I I think it is frankly a sin nominal strategic mistake for the Republican Party to go down this road but you know they've been going down the road for two plus years specifically with sexual assault allegations and\nAs a result we've seen women sweep into power and son campaigns and run for office and that is just you know increase now\nLet me read

and say gee do you believe this that we seem to be waiting another game here it's amazing it requires\nWhat a seminal callers call the suspension of disbelief and it is a lot of unlikely in his ear in fact Rick or the beginning of the season people are saying well if they make five hundred there'll be pretty good for this team\nAnd I was one of those people saying that if you looked at the rotation coming into the season it was I thought it was probably the worst than all the baseball and they lost all five of those guys and yet here they are so uh we're loving every minute of it especially as you said after three straight last place finishes\nWell also can't help but go back to twenty fourteen when they were a wildcard team also right before those three straight years but they were the best the best record in baseball at that time and they had a lot of the not necessarily patched together team that they have now they have the\nBest record at the all star break and then they made some very aggressive moves are trading their top prospect outs and Russell the good jobs ... and Jason Hamel from Chicago and then they made the move to trade you want to suspend his to Boston to go to John last year and I kind\nCut the heart out of the team and the AIDS survived the ladder member work in this game is the last day of the season sunny greyhound to throw a complete game shutout against the rangers just during the second wildcard and then there was the catastrophe Kaufman as I call it\nWe don't want to trade away at our young players anymore we've been doing it for Twenty years and now we're going to stop so the proof is in the putting we'll see if they do stop doing that in a\nWhile and it that's an interesting example to recognize that are\nShown do little was my favorite player on the team for all the years that he played as a fan if I were given the choice between ... and I would have I Would have Sean because I Love him but training has been amazing he's been he's been much better he's been\nMuch much more reliable than uh than do a little\nAbout anyway I'll throw a leader in finishing her love for individual players yeah you've got to have like instead of major league record this year has oh seven eight you already has the lowest you already in the history of baseball for any picture to pitch over Seventy five innings\nLet's go to our callers and we begin Matt from Lafayette was you good morning\n[noise] get morning thanks for having me on\nUm I just wanted one of the most exciting thing about it [noise] um I Know how many people on the couch Stanford I grew up in the area\nAnd market I mean and even Scotty joining a team at the local guys an exciting thing I\nThink people would come up\nYeah it's pretty cool thing when you think about it isn't the rec do\nYes you can post guy from Amman or a valley out and pleasant and you've got mark a semi and who's from St Mary's high in Berkeley by males and of course the bay area guy and went to a lot of day on the green concerts or the coliseum went to Cal so it's a nice little local I go there\nAnd here's another local color Merrill joins us from Oakland, Maryland\nHi I'm calling and asking\nOn you know my family and the number for Thirty years and I went in ... in the early ... my dad and I remember the magic of twenty twelve and then twenty Thirteen and they point manned twenty four and what do you think there's anything that they can do help like really push it\nOver the ad in the air\nGo ahead [laughter] hey thank you [laughter] um I think that\nThe magic is really there this year because when you look at the number of times that this team has come back um we've made jokes about the eighth inning and the eighth inning a has come back late in games and has come back from\nYou know three four runs down and come back to tie and then eventually come back to when we've been doing less of the um pie in the face a walk off ceremonies this year we do it sometimes but um it's the magic is is definitely there\nAnd this is a this is a team that does not give up\nIts end and I I Hope you're right about that there's a lifelong A's fan the days the three times before and the ... were intimidated by the Yankees especially in Nineteen eighty one strike season they swept the royals and the first round that's because the first hour flight the second half winter but\nEspecially in Nineteen eighty one strike season they swept the royals and the first round that's because the first time the second half winter but then they went Yankee Stadium and that was a ... a as a series they got destroyed up two O. two more times during the big three years choking on away the Jeter flip\nThere's something about going in the Yankee Stadium that subconsciously or consciously can intimidate guys I'm with Nina thinking that they're not going to be intimidated but I Want to see it\nTo believe it let me bring another caller from Oakland non Denise too high\n[noise] I think you can\nBring in the morning I just want to say that I think that there are so much fun to watch the game you know my first how are you know\nI hadn't thought much one [noise] but then you know you drive a car guy\nFormed on you can't get there you know like\nAll right and I think you Denise ... than other longtime while you're both longtime fans hunting great this team or how do you assistance team when you think about yesterday or when you think about Raleigh finger and Ricky Henderson and I mean\nYou know extraordinary talent uh you you you you think about some really great players and now you've got some great players too but they're coming off of a three year drought\nWell ... that those teams in the early seventies that hall of famers at five straight divisions three straight World Series titles\nYou think about the big three in the early to thousands they were fantastic at this team I as I said uh I predicted it I I\nThought in a perfect world that they would be five hundred a little more scrappy they have youngsters were a little ahead of schedule we didn't know that ... that's a match and was going to hit like crazy in the second half he let all the major league baseball in doubles and the second half second an extra Basij\nMatt Olsen we're kind of expecting more home runs we didn't expect him to be\nPlayed gold glove defense like he has but even the old guys like well Irish thirty four in the best season of his life like me and said you only have four areas the whole year this is a guy who wouldn't even bend his knees\nIn the wild card game and twenty fourteen and he had Ninety nine RBI for a second baseman of his stature that's usually like a Geoff Canada Ryan Sandberg type of guy jet Lowry is not a big strong guy\nNo budget resent amazing season even given his past history um there's a listener who writes I Love the age and I have for a long time it kinda bugs me however that we have traded away all ... teams worth of great players we are doing great with low payroll like Billy in the guise of one's gotten away with something but\nI'm having fun watching them act like the warriors there is all that kind of warriors type experiment but people are still angry about these great players being traded away\nAnd they should be it's a defeat us mentality and for a long time they were doing it I think the sort of sell the narrative that we can't afford them because we don't have any money and until we moved to San jose then we can start a forwarding and it's hard to keep a fan base that as soon as you get excited about a young guy especially got like a joke and it's also just Austin who still have three more years of team controlling you trade them then\nSo I can understand why a lot of people turn their backs and say look calming you when you start holding on to those\nGuys isn't it true though let me go to you on this new you know the day before the kind of had a plan and he went to the owners with it and they went along with it\nI I don't know that he did but I think that I think that that's probably true um but I think you know it's it's a difference in philosophy\nAnd you can look at a team like the giants who signed their great players to long term contracts and now they're stuck with some old older guys who don't really have it anymore and uh\nPeople love them and they show up of remembering the great times that they had in twenty ten and twenty twelve but you know\nAnd twenty four to and they have they have three rings to show for it and I'm getting at here for three a tweet from listening to someone tell recognition or the Yankees just announced submariners or surf oh there you go\nAnd the ... knock him around last time and he also started last year as wild card game and he gave up three runs to the twins and was out in the first thing\nThat here's another caller from Oakland Dan Hi you're on the air\nHey thanks for taking my call man I I I Love the game I Love the way they hit I'll tell you what though man that own Colosseum and one of the best kept secret in baseball\nI grew up in the bay area and it used to be the premier play the game you know you go to Glen became big things come out to the beautiful hill I'm telling you now I'm going back again and it's ten bucks you got a whole row yourself\nI don't want to spend ... bucks [laughter] guys I'm saying you\nKnow what I mean why you after you grow up in New Jersey\nYeah no I I I'm telling you well I spent some time on the east coast bunker I think the February now and it's going to be a beautiful beautiful thing but but the stadium to count on David and I\nKnow I thank you for the Suzie innocent ... let me we've got ... bill you want to talk about a new stadium location go ahead\nYes I did the basic thing is I agree with that last caller first of all in the fact that the coliseum is that it's it's an excellent\nPark I live a mile away from it and I enjoy the heck out of it every time I go up but the main thing was I was I was just ... when they are they announced the Peralta college sites and I thought that was going to be a wonderful site are cells that get what they\nDo we got seconds later good site thrilled to college or the review Rick new evidence dead now running on this and you know Howard terminal will be great just colors and all of them you can only around tomorrow at a quick coming from like\nThis has got to say I'm not that surprise you guys do this on a regular cycle they come out of nowhere and we'll go to a three four year run this was a fun team that is a team there is no ego and to reach point in the early nineties the franchise drew almost three million fans vicious sustainable\nOh I Believe so to the top so that they go ways will come back we're going to talk about\nSome criminal justice legislation lots of that unless you're talking about states in how Michael Krasny\nThis is coming up in our second hour this morning as part of our election twenty Eighteen coverage we discuss proposition six which would repeal five billion dollar you're a gasoline tax and fee increase the legislature approved last year to report California's roads\nAnd an October night joined me for a special line foreign broadcast that the Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa\nWe'll be talking with ... county residents and local leaders about how they were coping one year after the devastating wildfires\nFor more information and to join our live audience visit our website ... dot org slash for them [noise]\nIf you're in there for a second you know robbery conviction right now automatically you would get an extra five years for each previous felony that you had on your record this judge's decide you know hey in this case they don't think that's necessary or maybe we down\nAnd let me find out a little bit more about the transparency with you ... you know something's criminal justice reporter for ... news or\nThere's good deal of a will there's been essentially a kind of shield when it comes to a officers behavior for a long time now I mean even things like charges of sexual assault lying on the job or planting evidence all those things were shielded for the most part now\nThat's going to be transparent we talking also about a good deal of lobbying behind this resemble black lives matter groups like that\n[noise] well certainly I mean it had a [noise]\nA dozens of you know organizations like that like black lives matter of chapters in different cities around the state um the ACLU or\nThe state wide chapters Southern California northern California has really been United around not just a a Nancy scanners a Senate bill fourteen Twenty one but a years long legislative effort to try to change\nSort of the the status in California and in the instance as you mentioned because it's not\nThis legislation is not wholesale it doesn't mean that all police personnel files all records of misconduct are now\nSubject to public records act requests it's an era where it only gets at\n... findings and investigations on use of deadly force sustained findings meaning an investigator looked into it and said this appears to be true\nAbout a on duty sexual assault and official dishonesty lying and police reports tampering with witnesses a evidence and um perjury\nWhat would you mentioned inclusive this brings to my mind the fact that the bill with respect to forty five days on body cameras or they're talking about using body cameras ordinary police work to build up trust within the community that sort of well\nWhat I hear your time and time again and I think why this bill might have resonated with legislators who are are really starting to show a changing perception around police accountability and transparency issues in particular\nIs you know you talk to people on the street and they say what is the purpose of my police department rolling out body cameras if we can't see the video when it matters most when we're you know when we have a concern when there's public concern\nAbout an incident oftentimes a deadly incident and I think as you know over the past few years when we've seen\nA starting with major departments and now many departments in California adopting body cameras it's very um inconsistent between departments and really between incidents whether video will be released a there was a a an interesting case in Oakland just the other day released\nVideo from a a fatal officer involved shooting three years um after that incident a much longer than this forty five day time one\nSo I think you got to cut hair Alex you want to tell us about it I mean it has to do was unintended consequences\nRight um and and that's just a little bit of ... so we're talking about two separate bills that are addressed transparency and I found\nThe California police chiefs associations um position on both of those these are major a city police chiefs throughout the state\nUm they supported this bill that we're talking about opening up certain misconduct files but they were opposed to the bill that would create a timeline for releasing body camera video I talked to a police chief David Swing who is also president of that organization and he said\nThis is going to be a major costs to try to turn around the release of body camera videos in these complicated investigations that often aren't going to be done by the time that they're that departments are going to be required to release these videos and he said basically it may\nCause police departments to think twice about adopting a program or start thinking about closing their body camera programs\nThey would not surprise me it over a period of time if we see a decline in the number of new agency is her adoption body weren't camera and possibly some agencies are currently have body on camera that might pull away from the program if the time constraints and the resource demand become too onerous\nAnd interestingly that's also an argument against ah the misconduct files being released um basically that smaller agencies don't feel like they have the resources to address it uh the the the bill's author says look these are on a narrow amount of records it should be something that the department's can absorb dreamer\nSo let me give us a phone number because we've got a short segment here and I know people want to weigh in and give you the opportunity to do that we're talking about\nThe governor signing sweeping criminal justice reforms into law with a ... and ... and with you our listeners if you have questions or comments\nPlease feel free to join the program you can do that right now at our toll free number it's an eight six six seven three three six seven eight six we

org slash forum or tweet us our Twitter handle is at stake the former so you're going to say\nOh I just I I I was struck when I heard Alex ... news report this morning with ... you know please give talking about the costs because I don't think that's actually the major argument they made against these cells to lawmakers\nAnd it it's not in it are saying now right they sort of change tactics um you know which is totally totally within their rights but I think that what they were saying to the lawmakers more about the about protecting police officers and that that's where the you know\nSort of unfair and that you know police officers can be targeted if you open up more records on and they also mentioned to Alex I think in any can fix it is that they may go back and try to get these over turn next year and the legislature and we'll of course\nThey may go back and try to get these overthrown next year and the legislature and we'll of course have a new governor and I think it will be very interesting to see what the what the mood in Sacramento around these issues more broadly not just police misconduct but um\nYou know the criminal justice reform under a new governor under a you know any legislature arguably and then you know we could you have to couple that with the fact that the police misconduct bill\nAnd I mentioned by surely Weber of San Diego who wants to change basically the legal you know parameters around when it's OK to shoot someone that they have promised to come back to the table and not all sides and so I think it'll be kind of interesting to see\nWhere we start they the you're at a given that you do have eight years of pent up frustration from lawmakers who those were vetoed around criminal justice and beyond [laughter]\nWell you mentioned a little earlier that there's also a juvenile justice a bill in the last couple of them in this whole package and I'd like a quick rundown and that's our listeners know can respond to it because as you said it's been an hour on a village to it as fast as we\nCan yeah so basically I'm two major bills that I did on that one makes it yeah and you see you can't prosecute kids under the age of twelve unless they accused of something very serious like rape and murder so essentially saying if you're eleven and under that you're ... anything you do should not be dealt with in the criminal justice system it should be dealt with outside of that system\nThe other one um says that fourteen and Fifteen year olds may no longer be charged with adults for crimes um the governor\nHad a pretty veto or I'm signing message on that essentially saying that he really struggled with it and I can I say I was very of yeah but he said that ultimately you know we should have a system that respects victims but also seek the path of redemption\nI think the agony came in governor Brown's part over the fact that he looked at all the numbers and he realized that there was a racial former mayor of Oakland silver\nRacial a disproportionate number of those who are being tried and convicted and put in a penitentiary also looked at ... younger people are who are put in the ... century or more likely to be lifetime criminals from those things we a major way let's say if our listeners way and now let's begin with an Oakland color Allan you're on the ... good morning\nYeah get just a quick comment on body again on ... and rubber camera has just full of what they\nWere voting allegedly real information is going to be a an idea that's for a living and have for decades and the\nThe imagery than what grade is going to be what the individual what ... what they\nI think Eli points are well we're taking A L if you want to come up\nYeah I think there's a couple of different ways to look at that it's absolutely true that sort of I I Would I Would cast it as the cameras\nViewpoint is limited to where it's pointed right and obviously to the caller's point a police officer depending on most of these are just mounted so where their trust is facing is where the cameras more or less likely to be pointed\nAnd I'm In every example that I'm aware of of officers do have the sort of discretionary ability to turn the camera on and off in certain circumstances so in some ways\n... it has to be enforced policy using force after the fact if an officer is supposed to have a body camera on\nAnd off sensibly recording whatever it is that they're doing 'em and they don't then there can be discipline out of that but that wouldn't be disciplined that we would necessarily ever find out about because it's not something that would be a\nRelief even after uh the new um misconduct a\nBill takes effect who's a listener who writes it let me thank you Alan for your call another call in

Michael Krasny last year the Democratic controlled state legislature approved a five billion dollar your tax on gasoline vehicle fees\nThe measure raise fuel tax was twelve cents per gallon diesel taxes twenty cents per gallon in order to repair the state's highways and roads proponents say the move was necessary to fund much needed infrastructure projects but the Republican led opposition says the fees or a financial burden for California residents\nNow voters will get to decide whether the tax should be repealed and us any further fuel tax or vehicle the hike will need the voter approval and in the show reform we're going to debate the proposition proposition six but first we're going to go to Katie Orr Sacramento politics and government reporter for communities\nNews and heavily things up frozen good morning Katie\nGood morning Michael well we should mention first of\nAll this was on the November sixth ballot what it took a million signatures to get it there but essentially and repealing SP one we're talking not only about has to be one increasing gasoline and diesel fuel taxes as I said but also it immensely constitution requires voters to approve of any future increases in fuel vehicle Texas where I can\n[noise] yeah that's right um it would repeal you mentioned the tax which went into place a last November and it would require any future attacks has to be approved by two thirds vote a of the people in addition to having to be approved by the legislature and the governor so it's another step\nEssentially I'm currently getting two thirds vote now or in the legislature is difficult as we saw with this a gas tax increase so then having to go to voters as well would be a pretty big hurdle for lawmakers to get past\nThe by the way it's Katie Orr who's with us not catty or that huh [laughter] um let me let me talk to you a bit about how this has\nBeen framed because it's being framed or even by the Jarvis people is being looked proposition Thirteen which passed back in Nineteen Seventy eight with a two thirds approval on a ballot measure they're saying this was a tax revolt\n[noise] um that is how ah yeah the Republicans would like to frame this this\n[noise] um that is how ah yeah the Republicans would like to frame this this um this measure\nUh this is something that is a they're hoping really will energize their voters and get them to the polls um it's been a it's a bit of a tough election for them again we have two Democrats running for an open Senate seat here\nIn California um be so we don't see a Republican getting people to the polls in that race um governor or ... given a tour oh candidate John Cox is not as well known in California certainly facing a heavy push against lieutenant governor Gavin new some in the race for governor\nSo they were hoping that this would be something that get their voters out and really energized them um however a recent poll from the public policy Institute of California shows that might not quite the working I'm ... six right now was\nA fifty two percent of voters saying they would vote against it and only thirty nine percent saying they would vote for it so it has a quite a bit of ground to make up and the next five weeks\nAnd then we should have measuring gubernatorial candidate Cox is a supporter as well as a donor of a proposition six but\nAddressing that problem but uh the sense of the traffic of relief a and public record of traffic relief in public safety so far for the spending of money under as the one you say what\nI say you can't trust these people because look at their behavior look at their past they've always diverted the money and the little crumbs that actually make it into road projects are so efficiently spent\nWhen you take this intern I find it absolutely offensive that the people who want to raise your taxes are right now threatening you by saying if you don't give us more of your money\nWhere we're going to cancel projects projects that you've already paid for Michael\nWe already had one of the highest gas taxes in the country prior to the gas tax increase giving us the second highest gas tax in the country we went from the feds highest gas tax to the second highest gas tax are you telling me oh you really think that we can't have good roads without\n'em a massive tax increase or you really saying that with the fourth or fifth highest gas tax in the country that we can't do what other states are able to do even though they got rain snow sleet\nOr on their roads the reason foundation does an annual survey of cost per mile maintenance costing construction costs\nFor state highway programs it found that California is spending two and a half times the national average per vehicle mile of road maintained and constructed and in the overhead accounts the bureaucracy\nThree point six times the national average now a lotta money doesn't even get into those inefficient bureaucracies that money is diverted to high speed rail\nOr two hundred twenty million dollars of sb one money's over the next ten years or being diverted\nInto a UC system for college and university grants I don't know what that has to do with the road repairs we see money diverted into parking wrecked programs farm programs and so for for for a ... you know to come here and say we're going to cancel your project that's what we call hostage taking it's inappropriate\nAnd we know that these people are going to threaten us I tried to bully us into raising taxes and scare us\nBut there are projects under way though I mean we're recognizing and what you called crumbs I Want to go right to that because uh\nYou know I I don't know how you respond to this because you've been putting the blame on the politicians and feel that they squarely deserve it but you had for example a number of the newspapers are now what do you make about the Los Angeles times saying hard to overstate how destructive this would be this repeal for California\nHe had the same newspapers that have been for the tax increase all along the same newspapers that\nUh we're against proposition ... proposition Thirteen in Nineteen Seventy eight look at the end of the working families out there are hurting and this is a regressive tax adding to their cost of living\nAnd if the money that we already give California was not sufficient then we could talk about this but the reality is we pay one of the highest gas taxes in the country prior to this increase\nAnd the money has been diverted and let me just say you say well the programs projects are out there\nThat can you tell me how much money we spend on roads prior to the SP one increased ever existing gas tax\nMichael you know what it is it's twenty percent\nTwenty percent of the gas tax prior to the increase went to roads we think it should be a hundred percent\nSo don't you dare sit here and threaten our safety and try to say that you're going to cancel projects for projects that we've already paid for with one of the highest gas taxes in the country are you kidding me with the sort of tactics that you folks are engaging in it's shameful\nThat's right you cargo didn't respond please\nYou and I'll bring the volume down a little bit here and when people yell at me I respond by lowering my tone so let's get to the facts rather than the fiction or friction that Mr demarco is

political she cannery\nThe Sacramento Bee ... is a reckless measure that plays politics with California's future so let's go to the truth of\nThis measure prop six\n... prop six would take away funds already being used for transportation it's locked in through article fourteen of the California Constitution for that purpose prop sixty nine that we just passed by eighty one percent of the vote\nLocked in the SP one funds for that purpose\nGirls who have been all due respect what about the accusation from Mr demise that\nMoney is being diverted to other things we asked essentially what he's on the record as saying here\nAnd that's what I'm responding to again article fourteen the California Constitution does not allow gas tax funds to be used for anything but our roads proposition sixty nine inches I Hope not true I didn't interrupt John ... I didn't interrupt\nYou really not true let me get\nBack there was a minister to let him finish the sentence place it was his point\nAnd proper proposition twenty two\nIn two thousand and ten locked in our transportation funds as well at the California transportation commission on which I served\nFor our fifty one thousand state highway miles we need eight billion dollars a year\nTo keep them in at least a fair or good condition current funding we have to point two billion we lose five point eight billion every year in our roads crumbling further because we don't currently have the phone so I'll give you some history\nFor cake you read the listeners the gas tax the state gas tax started in California in Nineteen twenty three at two cents a gallon that amount today\nIs the equivalent of where we are now after Senate bill one with past when you account for inflation the state gas tax is the same\nBecause we're a state of thirty nine million people who are tired of potholes who are tired of traffic and we're willing to invest to address it and there is no other funding source as Mr ... tries to claim\nWell I'm going to go back to ... miles before I Do that however called them I

that\nOh I'll be very specific because you know when you have someone representing the no side that just outright lies it's it's very easy to actually explain to people where they go to look at the facts and the truth\nFirst and foremost let me read from prop sixty nine which is what he keeps fighting it says except as provided in sections one six three one zero and one six three eight one of the government code\nThe legislature may not take any action that temporary there permanently diverts are appropriate these revenues for other purposes other than described in this division you what those two sections are one six three one oh one six three eight one\nIt provides the governor the ability to transfer money\nTo cover the shortfall in the general fund and so you know look you know ... you know if you're going to go on the air and light you're going to be caught in the region the actual tax also he says it's dedicated to roads it's not\nIt's transportation programs which includes high speed rail transit bike paths walk path and anything that the legislature deems related to transportation so please be honest with the people because\nHe got you been lying all along and we're going to have to break\nHere when we come back we'll hear with regard to the house has to say about being called a liar among other things here and we'll also hear from you our listeners so please stay to them you're listening for online cake in B.D on Michael Krasny [noise]\nThis is coming up tomorrow on foreign in our second hour Pulitzer Prize winning author and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin will join us\nTo talk about her latest book leadership in turbulent times it's an account about four presidents other countries to be dark periods in us history now that's overnight joined me for a special live for and broadcast as Luther Burbank Center for the arts in Santa Rosa\nWe'll be talking about ... county residents and local leaders about how they are coping one year after the devastating wildfires for more information to join our live audience visit our website ... dot org slash poor [noise]\nTax hikes and also we're not talking about so twenty twenty here on this right right but we have a better plan when when Mr Gore dino says oh you know they don't want to fix the roads oh quite the contrary we are upset because our money has been stolen year after year diverted from the roads\nAnd these guys are now coming along after they stole the money saying oh trust me again as they raise your taxes and I I pinkie swear this time I'll put it into the roads and then they sit here in a forum like this an outright lie\nBecause of my I got a lot of callers here and uh we we can maybe a voice suddenly had how much Michael Krasny\nHe's called me a liar about twelve times so far man had against Rhode Island Thirteen times may I at least respond\nTo that place quickly though if you have because we have lots of people want to join us\nHere's how the five point two billion roughly already being collected is being spent by categories and smart kick you read the listeners can decide whether they like this investment\nOf side point two billion state highways one point nine billion local streets in roads one point eight billion transit like I said the bird extension Cal train modernization et cetera seven hundred and fifty million\nTrade court orders five hundred and sixty million combined with congested court or programs as I mentioned on highway one oh one active transportation which Mr demarco doesn't seem to like that's\nThat's bicyclists pedestrians safety in St improvements is a hundred million a year he talked about parking egg programs that's rough road vehicles\nAnd egg vehicles that's a hundred and eight million dollars he talked about workforce development is a bad thing that's five million out of five point two billion to train future workers for our transportation jobs university research that he doesn't seem to like that's researching new technology\nAnd I should say this was all on your website and do you do see and they're going to go see the lock box plan that a College of violence a team is put out that let's go to our callers here and let's begin with you good morning REO Hi\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em my question\nIs about three point six times that we spend on\nTen minutes ago I'm I'm Wondering if that do cost of living that dude chronically underfunded our road um it does seem high and I can see where the argument is that we're wasting money but at the same time you know the problem is\nI make like somebody other transportation housing problem to California I'm just curious\nWell maybe I could get the two cars so Grant's on the other costs here higher than they are in other states\nBecause of the waste fraud and abuse let me say Ariel I think that's a great question which is why in our lock box proposal not only do we dedicate a hundred percent of the gas tax to roads which is a two billion dollar increase over what the tax hike or want to give us\nA we do a hundred percent of the sales tax on cars to transportation systems which is a six billion dollar increase over what the tax hikers are willing to get us\nBut we also call for efficiency reforms performance audits it'd be done regularly we'd call for a major shift in how the projects are managed by making it more a multiple control issue and what you'll find is a lot of the waste that we're we're we're we're seeing as identified by the legislative analysts office the nonpartisan LA oh\nThey found over thirty five hundred\nCaltrans engineers where we're not assigned any work whatsoever they were not actually doing things and that was a half a billion dollars of waste annually the reason foundation has cited the bloated bureaucracy and the overhead costs as the main problem in California that's driving the or two and a half\nTimes per project or three point six times per a overhead to charge per mile of road maintained or construct\nA permit me to go to another call here because I get as many as I can go next to Sean or excuse me go ahead John\nHi there my call 'em a comment on that question and comment is I'm a biker or I've been riding my bike in that area for my whole life and I I just\nThe roads are in disrepair so just right away a we have an address that issue at all for cyclists in an urban area which is an alternative to driving the my question is art I'm willing to power for housing authority I'm\nNot going to go in the office of transportation is just one more thing that's going to be that could be diverted with foreign and I'll take my\nThank you for that question I Know you want to respond to Mr de mild but you can also respond or the color if you can pack those two together for us ...\nI'd be happy to Michael Krasny thank you first Mr demarco was is twice cited the reason foundation let me give you an example of when facts are actually friction the\nReason foundation study that um repairing of miles of road miles of road costs more in California\nIs one that is not counting lanes where we're often four lanes of traffic and other states aren't always as robust and second we have to remember through our ports bridges et cetera\nThat twenty percent of the phrase that comes in the United states come in comes in to\nLA Long Beach Oakland and the beatings that our road takes\nA are expensive to repair I Want to go back though to a ... a key statement about accountability one of the provisions that Mr demarco says he wants to fix and twenty twenty with they measure\nNot on the ballot this time we should be debating prop sick and why it's bad for California\nIs he wants to do away with the accountability provisions that were in SP one it has a new independent office of audits and investigations reporting from ... to the governor and the legislature it will be a six year term\nYou said knew how new is well\nThat was in the Senate bill one legislation that passed in April of twenty Seventeen with an inspector general [noise]\nUm ... the local streets in roads phones to go to our four hundred and eighty two cities four hundred and eighty one already receiving those funds they have to maintain their level of effort requirements so that we are supplementing nuts planting the funds\nThat they are using their or five different categories that\nYou can find on the no one's six dot com website to go over all the accountability provisions that Mr de Maya wants to take away along with five billion a year and transportation finds\nA level of funding that brings us back with inflation to where we started in Nineteen twenty three with our state that yes tax in California so that we can improve our roads rebuild the sixteen hundred right now deficient\nAnd unsafe bridges that are in California so that we can continue to grow our state\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October fifteenth MLA dot Stanford di di di you\nNeeded road repair going on in Oakland in Sonoma County is where's the money coming from with those were fair stop with a yes vote on this initiative [noise]\nYes they would stop because if those are funded through the five point two\nBillion dollars in as the one fund since last November first remember one point nine billion of that is for fifty one thousand state highway miles one point eight billion is for our local street in road miles and we already have more than thirty seven hundred of those\nProjects funded out on the street now\nAnd before we go to our callers again Carl DeMaio let me go to you about something else has been a\nA good deal of a spotlight on this proposition that you are in favor of being political because it was designed some say to get more Republican voters out did you answer them\nThat well that's what are the politicians in Sacramento want to say because they liked the vis of politics here the facts over a million Californians are work together to get this on the ballot they signed a petition half of those signatures were from Democrats and independents you can't get more of a bipartisan than that\nBut let me respond nothing improper six on does any of the inspector general requirements in fact all we do is lower the tax back to the original rate or the inspector general office will continue to exist but Carl guardian was no funding have no funding to do anything with well you know what let's talk about that\nSo you sit there and say well all these projects are going to be canceled you realize Karl where do you know there are alternative plan does not require a tax increase in fact you already have all the money's in our alternative plan\nBut you choose not to find the road repairs this is a choice that you and your buddies in Sacramento have made to not fun not prioritize rubber Paris the only time you want road repairs or when you want it to your TV commercials to convince people to give you more of their money\nEither like Lucy and Charlie Brown into football you keep telling us that you're going to give us the football but you always take it away and so you know damn well that you have every single penny you need to finish does this project you know why because we released a plan last week and the LA oh\nScored our plan showing that our plan adds up and you can actually from the project\nI get a response to a listener about here plan a listener named Chris a curled up ... there should never be any measure that absolutely locks in spending to the single purpose California has a lot of earthquakes mudslides and fires the state government under this question of the executive should always be able to transfer funds as emerging needs them in\nOh Chris I I understand some of the argument there but here's the reality you can't trust these politicians because they've lied they've diverted they've stolen in the past and I think that if you talk about our roads we know that they are in disrepair uh but we already pay for good roads so how do you fix that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Forum (KQED)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
