institutions and elected officials\nAnd that's one of the central question as a journalist and political analyst on under there does brings to the fore here and exploring in his new book winners take all the elite charade of changing the world\nHere or there does joins us here in Studio to discuss the ways that entrepreneurs philanthropists and tech billionaires are affecting the world and\nPerhaps making things worse welcome to the program and great to be here good to have you here well this is essential your thesis that this global elites are taken over many foundations or trying to do good at least as they put it out they're solving problems with philanthropy but not coming up with solutions\n[noise] they come up with the kinds of solutions that are in their interest uh we live in this age Michael in which\nThere is unquestionably are enormous amount of wealth and we're sitting here in the San Francisco bay area which has been the greatest new engine of that wealth in our generation and and\nA very generous age by many measures a lotta these rich people want to give back want to solve problems signed the giving pledge plan to solve the diseases fixed public schools go to space and homelessness\nMake these big declarations and put real money behind them we also live in an age in which young people not billionaires but just young people on campuses at the elite campuses all seem to want to change the world and go to Africa to start a social enterprise and this and that and yet we can't avoid the hard\nData that this has also been the most punishing era for middle and working class Americans in a hundred years and this has also been the era of greatest inequality and last year alone Michael this is I Want your listeners to think about this for a second to last year\nContinue a pattern in previous years eighty seven percent of new wealth created last year was cornered by the top one percent in the world so this is not\nA set of just past injustices that we're not rectify and fast enough the injustices ongoing the very people who are claiming to be fixing our schools and ending diseases and helping others are at this very moment at this very our cornering the fruits of the future\nAnd guaranteeing the continued a struggle of an America in which most Americans can achieve the American dream\n... just gave is a pretty shocking one as well so shocking when you point out that\nA hundred and Seventy million Americans in the lower quadrant or or really below the what we consider the middle class uh haven't moved forward and wages in about forty years um\nBut there's also the sense that you come across that these folks who think they are doing good and connecting the world and all the rest of this or maybe more of the problems that they are the solution that they're seeking to do good but they're doing more harm than living up to your book subtler just being just a short here subtitled a charade\nYeah I mean I think one of the things that if\nIf you're with me as as many of your listeners may be that look we do live in this very generous age there is all this activity but we also do live in this manifestly unequal age then the question becomes how do you square that right how could the same people who are being so generous also be upholding such a bad system and\nOf how much power even if it's a cause you and I might like like climate change which I Do like how much power should Tom Steyer have over that issue I think that's a real question just because I like it doesn't mean it's democratic\nWhy do we work so hard why have we worked why do people die\nTo secure one person one vote in this country\nIf we have like a fourth branch of government over here\nThat is in which only rich people are represented which is ... which about four hundred and ten billion dollars last year the year before and it was just capitalism again the rich get richer and the poor I don't know they kind of stay the same or they don't move like this is not just capitalism this capital this is actually a question of democracy because these people are not I am not\nDecrying people who are who have their businesses and make money and live their lives I'm Talking about people who didn't take that money and ... and feel like they deserve a right to rule deserve\nDumped ... and the and these people generally don't just dump money into a cause they said on the board of the cars they run the organization they stay with the school should do you like the rulers they become rulers well they have been in fact the kind of de facto ruling in a sense or they become they become oligarchy or or aristocrats and and so\nYou you know I think one of the things that we\nOne of the things that I this is a dark moment in American Life in many ways but one of the things that's very good about it that doesn't often feel like that as we are having\nA conversation about some of our primordial issues as a country we are talking about white supremacy in a way in a mainstream way we're not talking about it five years ago we are talking about male supremacy\nIn a way that we we're not talking about it five years ago and part of what I'm trying to suggest here is the third supremacy in American Life that we don't talk about enough which is capitals supremacy\nWe talk about inequality and these things the part of what this is getting at is we are living in an economy now and this is a global phenomenon to some extent but it's really acutely true here we're we have a centrally built in the economy in which\nCapitalist Supreme and if you own capital and hold capital born into capital as we learn to Donald Trump expos they yesterday than you are going to get ahead in life\nAnd if you work for a living as perhaps many of your listeners do then unfortunately things are not going to be as easy for you and we have to think about whether that's the kind of society we want and we used to think about whether we\nAre going to think about changing that in the old San Francisco way which is movements and organizing and changing\nPolitics I think all of us he just did a lovely isn't that correct or whether we want to solve that in the new San Francisco way which is creating a nap\n[laughter] the author of of\n[laughter] the author of winners take all with us in Studio the elite charade of changing the world and we're going to

lot of your criticism and I've said similar things critically about\nUm in fact it's fascinating to read\nWhat you say about Facebook that calls itself a community won't call itself a company which I think is very regulatory in many ways but the reality is that Facebook is connected people and they make that argument they combine oh we're connecting people all over the world but at the same time it's been weaponized it really did toxic a\nTerrible damage in the last election has helped white supremacist and so forth I mean I mean all these in other words negative things that have come about\nNegatives would be but when you think about Facebook ... when he listens to think about the only thing I think there's a case to be made that Facebook is the most idealistic major company in American history right I think there's I Can't think of any other company that has all of that size and scale that has so\nAssertively declared itself to be\nA community dedicated to the mental patient of mankind and I think it has no accident that\nPerhaps the most idealistic company in American history is also the first company in American history to compromise a sacred federal election in other words the idealism creates blindness it creates arrogance it creates a refusal to look within\nAnd the reality is General Electric never compromise an American election bank of America never compromise an American\nElection they also never cause death in Myanmar and India but the real relevance here is to the fact that there was always the downside was innovation you read about innovation a lot you bring up the fact that innovation has brought mainly rewards to those who are the wealthiest and most affluent siphons itself up or\nI mean this word innovation is everywhere I mean I I hear from teachers\nWho are trying to teach their kids which is a pretty traditional thing you do when you actually\nDoesn't need to change that much every year to actually teach kids how to write and think and do science and these teachers are bludgeoned by this outside pressure like innovation we've gotta teach innovation with each innovation and you know the problem with this innovation cult innovation just means new stuff\nOkay that's Latin or whatever it is for new stuff and here's the problem we have made a cult of innovation\nAnd we've forgotten a word that actually matters more which is progress\nProgress is when most people's lives get better because of said new thing but we have over the last thirty forty years in America\nIs a remarkable ... junction\nBetween innovation and progress does anybody listening to this feel like we haven't had enough new stuff\nIn America lost thirty forty years I think we're all tired of new stuff that's been too much new stuff\nYou also make a very important but it hasn't made most people's lives better actually the machine in American Life that converts innovation new stuff into progress betterment for most people that machine is broken and and what I'm arguing is the repair that machine is our most urgent national priority and\nThat the people who helped with a vested interest\nIn not smoothing out\nInnovation or the progress for all who actually have a vested interest in hoarding progress for themselves those people are going to be the ones who save us\nYou know I I was gonna say I find a strike you know you make a distinction between um generosity on the one hand injustice on the other and I think that's an important dichotomy because people can be very generous but not necessarily work toward justice but when you say repair the machine or for that matter dismantled machine I don't know what are you what are you suggesting specifically\nYou know that that may sound very dramatic and and idealistic as you said it is but you know I often remind people I'm a lot of what I'm Talking about it a practical level is simply bringing us into line with the rest of the rich world right we\nAre you know when you look at those lists of like which countries do this versus don't and you know it's always like Saudi Arabia is always like the one on you know various human rights and things like we are that for the rich world and we don't realize that we're our social mobility is at the bottom in terms of the rich world\nUm our taxes and many cases on wealthy people are much lower than I was from the rich world our minimum wages are lower than much of the rich world are we obviously deprive health care to people many ways we become a third world country I think we've we've become two countries the the part of America that is high functioning is\nNot just first world but the the richest and most successful of the first world countries no question um I you know you're better off being in the top\nTens of America than you are being in the top tens of I think any other country in the world um if you're in the bottom half of your society are much better off being in any other rich country about America perhaps and so a lot of things I'm Talking about uh not rocket science we probably need to tax\nInheritance is more and have marginal tax rates on rich people go up to where they were you know thirty forty fifty years ago we probably need to fund public schools equally we probably need to make sure that you get health care whether you work twenty nine hours of target or thirty hours a target and not have your health care kick in only if you happen to work\nWe probably need to make sure that uh people are not ah with the women are not faced with decisions about do I work or not based on the fact that we don't give any kind of support with\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history

campaign that has tried to convince us\nThat we can't make change in the old ways their movements and policy and law that the only change worth making our when wind changes that put companies and

people\nSort of more of our listeners let's go next to you Rob joined us You're on the air\nThank you um I grew up in the seventies and we studied all it was a kid you know in public school San Francisco and we studied the social injustices that happening\nIn the nineteenth century and and what happens with the environment and we really thought that by talking about this and learning about it\nWe would have a better society by now\nAnd it just seems like we're starting to make a lot of the same\nMistakes and and running down the wages of people the unions are getting less powerful and have people that are uh like the um gym is that Mr stiers ah for every one of those that's out there there's also a cop brothers\nYou know and they're trying to drive down the idea of the government can help they want to make people think the government is part of the deep state and then we have to eliminate all the environmental laws all the labor laws that were\nA weird and acted to try to make this a better world and I'm not a communist on social capital it myself but it think that capitalism has gone through this whole new level and the idea that your\nGuest said that we have enough we don't need to be consuming more stuff we need to make the planet better and we were going about it I just feel like our answered an it's depressing\nRob I appreciate your framing it that way and giving us your feelings are kind of depressing as what you hear a lot of people say humans can can I\nCan let me address the depression and provide hope er which is when I hear Rob ... it's such a valid question he's raised me and I think\nWe are actually if you if you leave Trump aside for a second but in in in many ways because of Trump we are actually having a conversation in America about capitalism\nThat we haven't had in a long time a real conversation we have people running on all sides of the spectrum we have democratic socialist we have\nPeople who are not democratic socialist running a very progressive platforms but we also had an Donald Trump a Republican who ran against Wall Street and the global financial elite not caring about communities which\nI hate what he did with it but in some of that diagnosis he actually was naming something accurate and so I think this is a very right moment in America to be talking and thinking about capitalism and the point I Would make is in America we often talk about capitalism has some big monolithic thing\nYou either have it or you don't write capitalism is not binary\nPenny capitalism comes in a lot of flavors perhaps even more than Baskin Robbins\nAnd you have Chinese capitalism which is combined with an authoritarian government in a Communist Party that still in power but is really capitalize on a bunch of ways but also restricts free trade and very creative ways where they require foreign companies to have local partners which meant that they got the entire\nCorporate infrastructure of the world to mentor a generation of Chinese executives and CEOs very smart\nNo so it really wasn't told Marshall property which gun short Trump has made a ...\nI'm just talking about variety and diversity right you have in Europe in Germany you have capitalism that whether we think so or not to know about it or not is it Germany pretty successful society with\nWith great wages but also great companies are really great companies car companies industrial companies of all kinds and your kitchen perhaps as a bunch of German companies represented and\nThey have done that in a way that is not\nAt the expense of workers people have health care they don't work twenty nine hours and therefore die of preventable diseases in Germany and they have boards corporate boards that have environmental and community stakeholders on those boards so they don't hear about the community discontent only when you have a\nPopulist demagogue take power they actually hear about them in the board meetings and\nYou have in many parts of the rich World Health care as a guaranteed right for people that is not that is very much part and parcel of the capital of systems they have evolved because they have actually had the intelligence to realize that having people\nStay in jobs they don't like instead of quitting started company because they're afraid of losing their health care is actually not very good for capitalism right so what we actually need to do is get off our\nHigh horse in America thinking we're the only capitalist society on earth and actually get out there and study the dozens of people who who of societies that have practiced various forms of capitalism that have created a rainbow of capitalism\nI Would argue that that was the essential frame of the Bernie Sanders' campaign I mean to do exactly what Bernie's proposing one specific version that's that's what I'm I'm making a different point which is there's a lot of capitalism is out there 'cause they say where do you do things like Scandinavian countries we can't even have the only model\nMy what I'm saying is there's a buffet here we can do trade like one country does we can do health care like another country that's there's variety out there that we're not seeing because we are arrogant and were separated by from the rest of the world by notion on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet it done with a freelancer good morning I'm Sandy ...

debate is not necessarily an indication of the final votes but how realistic is it that senators will change their minds\n[noise] well I think that what we've seen as a sort of columns in particular saying that this was a vote only to move the process forward she'll be announcing later today how she changed her vote in the final vote so that leaves things up in the air\nOr surgery mansion ah voted to move the process forward but we're not sure if that was a an indication of what are your plans to do on the final vote so things are so up in the air or certainly\nThe White House and the capital for Trump to feel good though uh to get over this hurdle because this could have been the one that stops the nomination\nWe have seen this happened writes the John McCain voted no um to block the repeal of the Affordable CARE Act um but historically if this has happened to end debate um senators usually aligned with what they initially voted for um during this process correct\nThat's correct uh but you know this process has been on like any a Supreme Court nomination were sharing a different even Clarence Thomas's a and show a you know we have to\nThrow things a little bit out the window and keep an open mind about what might happen this is a you know this is a part of a battle but ah it's really unlike the one that we've seen before the Supreme Court nomination\nThank you for that this is really interesting because historically there needed to be sixty ... isn't that right Lorraine before I didn't know of course each um nomination\nThere where yes there needs to be an Robert maybe when I'm Out in the history here but they're going to be at sixty pounds that you already required um and then there was a a you know I'm\nA gridlock and they went with the what's called the nuclear option right where he changed the rules basically you get someone to Robert ... helped me I'm afraid your yeah I'm afraid you're gonna have\nTo blame blame both the Democrats and Republicans for this ah when the Democrats were in charge of the Senate and President Obama's nominees to lower courts were being a ... of war being held up because uh they couldn't get past this ... vote threshold\nThen Senate majority leader Harry Reid changed the rules are just say that it only require fifty votes\nAnd uh the fact that it wouldn't apply Supreme Court nominees only all other federal charges\nAnd but after he did that for Republicans took over and they had the Supreme Court opening a and uh they didn't think they would get ... votes for Gorsuch them they changed the rules to make it a simple majority\nI'm so both sides have had a hand in changing as I Do think that it\nMakes a difference perhaps in the kind of not many that comes forward or I think I'm more extreme nominee on either side has a better chance um if he or she only has to get fifty one votes or instead of sixty\nMhm um I Am a woman named Kim who wrote in um to get clarification think you can for a sliding nice for you Robert binds she said you just mentioned the ADA is looking at ... what does he mean and how could their findings in this nomination to the Supreme Court\nWell uh I don't know exactly what it will mean by the ADA gave a cabin or a a rating of ... qualified which is their top a rating and said that he was you know Supreme lay qualified to be on the Supreme Court\nUm they announced today that they were going to sort of re look at that\nUm but Republicans are very suspicious of the Republicans the fact of the ADA is basically another liberal a group and uh they have in the past sort of a downplayed the importance of an a da rating\nThey played it up with cabin on but they did it and sort of the even the ADA you know says that cap it off his well qualified so while I think it's a sort of another data point I don't know that it would change a any minds on the Republican side\nKind of ... let's take another call Gary from Sacramento Hi Danny\nI get morning I wanted to tell you my experiences last week uh I was in the entire hearing a thought he'd see we're both\nCredible so I didn't take position and I was waiting for the results of the FBI investigation and uh come Monday I wasn't going to do and make them listen and learn\nAnd then come Monday I heard some McConnell said he wanted to go ahead now hold a vote this week and that was before they even knew the FBI is that the view from a pope I called his office in\nTo tell who whoever the my opinion whether they could wait until the at the end of the shows over ... like they have as much of the facts as possible I called there I got one of his aides on the phone [noise] and ah so are you taking public input on the\nKevin ... and she says are you for again\nSponsorship of dictate you read the live

she said senator McConnell's office to help you and I said yes you and I almost had a conversation a moment to go and see up\nYes they weren't bombarded with calls they needed a yes or no I'm ... and you wanted to respond to that\nWell I mean this is let's take a step back here I mean we what we're seeing now I don't think has ever happened before right like we had people that's what we had hundreds of people in the heart Senate office building this morning\nProtesting this like shouting you know there were people arrested um we've had people marching in the street I'm like I I don't think that has ever happened with a ... Supreme Court nominee\nHistory a ... just unprecedented level of sort of civic engagement so um yeah you know that senator all the senators are overwhelmed 'em by this and it's it's ... this is just unprecedented what's happening\nLet's take another call we have Jason Jason from large bird Hi Jason\n[noise] morning you wanted to interject weren't as mornings I quite common and not just sort of Internet or you\nKnow Jason I'm so sorry your call is breaking up but um\nI think what he wanted to say essentially was that both sides are frustrated at 'em and um that it's time for\nFolks to galvanize and I think that on both parties um which brings leads me to a question for both of you Lorraine Willard I'm with political and Robert Barnes of the Washington Post I'm\nReally is this um moment a galvanizing or unifying moment for them to you know the answer to Democrats for that now\n[laughter] I Know I don't think so because I was just um unrelated to cabin I was meeting with semi public in the morning and\nThey were all just dismayed\nAt what's going on um they are sort of on the fence\nOn Kavanaugh they're not like it's not like you know all the Republicans are sort of out for blood on this um you know given uh the one who found in all ... um I don't think that's necessarily true through the larger party drop the larger party I knew that um some of the women signed the letter\nI'm endorsing Kavanaugh before Dr Ford delegations came out some of them are having second thoughts a show a you know I think the\nRepublican leadership in the White House sees this as a you know of the site that has to be one but I'm not sure ranking Republican he's not one I'd like to know what I Want I wouldn't have Robert\nI Would add from my point of view that if it is a galvanizing moment for the Democrats stand or for the Republicans will then it's a bad moment for the Supreme Court\nI'm In the court really tries to convince the public that it is not a partition a branch of government that it is the one branch that there is no I'm Puerto Rican and tries to think\nThrough these weighty issues um um I can tell you this must be causing heartburn for chief justice John Roberts who has a very much try to represent that sort of image\nOf the court and all the justices whether they're liberal or conservative will tell you that it is a a very bad work for the court if\nBy nomination appears to be a victory for one chart or the other\nQuestion I Want to know if either one of you can answer it and um we're down to I just a few more moments of the show on Mars he writes if confirmed what will the scenario look like if Dr for decides to press criminal charges well it was was a very long time ago the statute of limitations have probably likely passed\nRight I I think it's I think that the guy has passed that I think it would be awfully hard to do any kind of a criminal charges a you know I think I'm more likely scenario and or a mark do better as\nA house or there's turned over to the Democrats are in the mid term elections from one state takeover will they continue to pursue charges against a been such a justice cover and all and that could be something that could a royal things for a while\nWe can be talking about this all morning thank you both for joining me Lorraine Willard White house reporter with political when Robert barn Supreme\nCourt

seven eight six\nUh you know we were talking a little bit earlier about your experience your opponent at Hernandez was first elected to the assembly and two thousand six um we have several people have written and Peter writes you have never served in any elected position I'm\n\nGiven your ties I'm Sorry I'm reading and reading like two things at once I'm so why are you now asking the voters of America's most populous state to elect you to a position that would have you replace the governor and the event that he leaves the office I'm sure you've heard this many times you how you do have a lot of experience but you've never held elected office\nSo I have held public office it's very important um you know first they said well you didn't hold public office when they did when I was a United States ambassador I have is a senior official in the Obama administration but then people say well maybe that's not enough look there are lots of different state\nSponsorship averted you read the live stream by diverge master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature bent political science and infection will be held on Monday October Fifteen year Mel a Dutch Shepherd WVU\nJordan area challenges to have the opportunities I've had in my life\nI was the first to my family to graduate from a four year university I worked in a male dominated industry and housing delivering market rate affordable housing two hundred thousand dollar homes in the Sacramento region to working families who need a place to raise their families and their children\nAre and then I was asked sworn in as the United states ambassador when I was just\nForty three years old and served overseas with distinction so I have overcome tremendous things to be able to provide leadership and ah I ... and hardworking and by all accounts and everything that I had\nGone out and intended to do I've delivered so my case to the voters of California\nIs that leadership comes in all different sizes and all different colors and that if we want change real change [noise] we have to look beyond the stereotypes of what leadership looks like and look for people who had actually delivered\nA you talked about affordable housing and uh your time in Sacramento um growing up there I'm your a debt is uh Sacramento real estate developer I'm a very prominent one um how does this impact your impartiality since you will also serve on the state lands commission\nAnd so let me tell you a little bit about my dad he was a farm worker when he came to California when he came to the United states\nMy grandmother back in Greece never learned to read or write she let my father come here to work and labor in the fields\nHe had no a notion of what kind of opportunity really would await him here I she went to Sacramento State University he paid sixty two dollars a semester to get an education didn't quite graduate but got an education I and started a business\nNow is typical an immigrant families I worked with my father I went to business school at Berkeley and I work with my father's side by side\nAnd the work that we did um in delivering affordable housing to families in Sacramento region was really all about keeping the pathway of the American dream open for others that we've experienced on you know it never\nI we we never lost sight of the fact that my story his story has been so incredibly unlikely to have opportunity to start a business grow a business\nAnd so it's no surprise that for us we would want to continue to do the kind of work that would help other families because nothing is more emblematic of the American dream\nThan being able to afford your own home so that is my family story and it keeps me very close to the people who I met with out on the road as I've traveled to all fifty eight counties of California meeting\nWith people in hearing their stories\nAt the same time I just want to push back on this um with your dad being the prominent real estate developer he made a two million dollar plus donation to your campaign\nAnd so this idea that you'll be serving on those states land commission um about keeping spaces open beach access public access um\nTalk to me about your impartiality with that connection that deep connection with your father and a your father's relationship um with land ownership in this state\nWell again I think that you're looking at sort of a stereotype that just doesn't apply here on my entire career has been about advancing the interests of our democracy\nAnd nothing's says I'm you know public interest more in California than public access to our beaches\nSo I feel very strongly about that and I think that anyone reading my book a madam ambassador where I talk about my work in advancing democracy in American values overseas serving in the Obama administration being the first in my family to graduate from a four year university\nThese things are very telling about who I Am and where I come from my first job was at the California Democratic party I make five times delegate to the Democratic national convention\nFighting for the interests of our people has been fundamental because if it weren't for the Democratic party fighting for people like me I wouldn't be where I Am and I have proven that many many times over\nWe're talking with lieutenant governor candidate all a nickel and I guess ah we have a couple of calls here let's take our first call from a giant giant from Sacramento Hi\n[noise] thank you that's going to lock setting up\nUm in full disclosure I'm a local candidate school board and\nMy question relates to the budget and knowing that we're just catching up on ... actually three days\nAnd knowing that there should be on the ballot you feel how do you intend to deal with the attitude that it shouldn't be in the art you don't get to the goal of\nHigher education that you\nWill have very much for your activism and for ...\nI think that you\nWill have very much for your activism and for stepping up and running for office um you inspire me as so many women across the stage where we're doing the same thing\nI and um it's a very good question we have many needs and how are we going to fund these things I Do think that going back to what I said about public higher education\nIs that when we prioritize education that will go a long way to ensure that we have the funding that we need first students so I'm proposition Ninety eight you probably have already felt the impact per pupil spending for K. fourteen has gone up\nAs a result of proposition Ninety eight passing now more than forty percent of the California budget goes decay fourteen that's very very important but you know as you note a per pupil spending in California is still among the lowest in the country so we have a lot of work to do\nUm I really think it's very important to talk about education as an investment\nBecause truly when you look at higher education we know that our economy is as strong as it is because the sea su the you see and the community college system are there to educate our workforce\nThere was a lot more that we can do to find deficiencies I started to talk about that a little bit more so for instance\nThey used to be you know back when I was ... Berkeley that the goal of graduating and for years was still very much attainable now it's five years it's six years it's eight years to graduate which means that it's more expensive for students who are making their way through and it also um\nMakes it so that other students who want to get in have to wait so I think that um in really focusing in a very wonky way on how we can get students through faster that's one way that we're going to be able to add capacity without necessarily adding to the budget and I think that there are other things that we can do\nAs well to find capacity and let me give you one example\nUm because you'll be working with kids up through high school and when they look across the spectrum of what their higher education options are people are really recognizing that the community college system has so much to offer and right now we have to point one million students across California\nCake you read the San Francisco Kaye queuing I north highlands

much it's great to be her Tania\nSo you've been you've been on the college circuit you were at Stanford last night and you've been really across the country talking to young people I Know the onion I mean it's been around since I was in college how young people um [noise] how do they how do they interface with you and how do they do they have that same relationship with the onion\nYes they all know of it but more so recently people are telling me oh my dad got me into the un [laughter]\nWhich is a little depressing too bad so if it you know they see it on social media and it's out there so and the people who come to the talks unless it's mandated by the school or something they are interested in you know they've heard of it they like it and they want to meet the guy behind it so\nYeah so I read this book um [laughter] that's ... actually read I read it over a a few days and I was going to say to you my first question to you really what's going to be why they tack why it allowed mass\nAnd then I happened to check I eat lines Twitter feed this morning and his tweet from yesterday as\nTesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla and get any image they want laser etched in class and set to deep space for millions of years and I just cracked up because I Swear it sounds like that comes directly from your book\nYes so that's one of the reasons why I like covering subject matter like this\nBecause when somebody is so absurd and I wrote a book about Donald Trump a half years ago that's right right after the election uh actually I wrote well before the election oh you ... yeah uh it was called Trump's America by this book in Mexico will pay for it\nAnd you must have been the same category because they're sort of larger than life crazy eccentric billionaire characters\nWho a lot of people say kind of defy satire because they're already kind of living high pro beliefs\nAnd you know that's just like a challenge to me like oh I think I Can't do satire and on this person just watch so then I I Love or putting together material on them and and\nUh seeing what happens with it so the great thing that does happen or when it does\nAnd it's kind of what led to the onion because I was kind of a campus celebrity with this popular comic strip that I did and so the two guys who started the onion or came to me before a they put out issue one to see if I wanted to be involved so\nVery quickly I was ... editor and then after a few months they sold it to me\nAnd left and so I was owner editor for many years after that yes why not the longest planning editor yeah I think by far I'm I think I have a lot of like Fifteen Years as editor in chief on and off like I go and and\nThink I'm done and then somehow get drawn back in and then I leave again and then I get dropped drawn back in\nThe interesting thing is I'm a nineties college percent and I I remember the onion and he was very clear that this was satire um we're now in this age of um fake news and you have really strong feelings about\nUm what the onion dies and this idea fake news satire versus fake news talk a little bit about that yeah I Do\nBecause when the onion came out it was the only thing of it's kind of fake newspaper doing fake news and it confused a lot of people but eventually they would understand the joke and they would get it and everybody was enjoying it\nBut as it grew\nIt spawned a things like the Daily Show because um when John Stewart started the Daily Show he actually hired my right hand guy in Harlem to be his show runner executive producer because he wanted to make the Daily Show more like the onion like a fake news parity show and then had helped me do that at the onion\nAnd so John hired him to do that and then when he was there he co created the ... show with Stephen ... bear\nWhich was even more like the onion and the Daily Show because now there was no breaking character and you know the onion never breaks character and didn't even though they are do some early you know yeah that is trying to do an onion I or you show that some great trivia about the onion so on the ... show\nWe are going in and hardy [laughter] yeah I Know that that there's a great documentary about that show on Netflix because it had the most amazing writing staff Steve krill I'm Steven co bears Lucy K Robert smuggle\nIt was an incredible staff and the show was a complete bomb because it was just in the wrong time it was on a ABC like in prime time and they were trying to be a little edgy and it just did not work anyway so we were working with them producing a some news bits that Steven Kobe or read\nOn the show and it was the first fake news that he read as a young person\nIn the mid to late nineties so yeah getting back to the story of satire so\nThere was a whole generation of people who grew up only seeing satire through the lens of news parity because there was an onion there was the Daily Show there was no bearing on so many imitators\nAll other satire was really relegated to um obscurity and so for a lot of people the term satire is equivalent to fake news like they just assume it's the same thing whereas no actually satires thousands of years old and there have been satirical plays and novels and\nArt and all sorts of stuff\nSo in the twenty sixteen election when people put out propaganda set a that was masquerading as\nSo in the twenty sixteen election when people put out propaganda set up that was masquerading as news they literally labeled a satire ... thinking that that term was a ... because it was fake news again not the same thing that's just propaganda\nSatire is when you try to uh make humor\nBy pointing out what's wrong with the world and communicating to people so yeah with those people are doing even though I Do bear some responsibility for the existence of all the propaganda really doing is they're not doing satire and it's wrong and it's completely different from what the onion does where if you were fooled by it\nThat's not the point the point is to maybe become a little bit more of a critical thinker and be entertained by it and\nIf you take it seriously then that's your fault it's on you especially if you're somebody who should know better like somebody in a position of authority which sadly happens too often\nMhm we're talking with Scott ... founder of the onion dot com and author and editor of walk into the future which is mind by not eat aligned mask on\nYou caused humor as science I'm really interested in the process of creating an article like the onion or their pitch is like a newsroom or is it something like creating an ...\nYeah I think it is a little different and I do believe him writing science I wrote a whole nonfiction book about it a very serious book called how to write funny just lays out all my process for how to do it names parts of the process that never had names before and\nA lot of people have used that book to learn to write comedy and been very successful so it's totally true and like I was saying before you can teach comedy\nAnd I started this program at the second city that's kind of based on my book to teach people how to write prose humor and uh yeah a lot of people have come out of those classes and gotten jobs that are working in comedy now after a very short time period yeah so that's very exciting\nFor me the system at the onion just to summarize it and maybe how it's different from SNL is\nFirst of all it's all about a ... like you have to produce a lot of jokes and then sift through those jokes to find the best ones but this is where things get tricky because in a place like SNL from what I understand I've never worked there [noise]\nPeople pitch their ideas in person and then the head writer sort of says urinate or maybe depending on the vibe in the group or maybe Lauren or somebody decides what to do [noise]\nI knew instinctively at the onion that that was the wrong way to do it because as soon as the person in charge is seen as\nAssessing people's work as their pitching it than politics enters the situation any kind of dynamic that's going on in the room is going to affect it people are going to write jokes that are going to appease the boss or\nThe the boss my favorite people who she likes more or whatever\nAnd sadly it's almost always a he in comedy yeah and so at the onion we made it into a meritocracy where jokes were red without names\nYou pick the most boring sounding person in the room to just read off this lady of jokes to replicate the experience of the reader because they don't know who's pitching the job and I see it they just see the joke yeah so it has to rise or fall on its own merit and then\nThese meetings are boring where you just sitting there listening to joke after joke after joke and then\nEvery once in a while you hear a joke and you'll go oh that one wasn't too bad you know and then that gets put on the shortlist and then the next day you look at the shortlist\nAll these jokes that like barely you know there's almost never laughter like when you're going through these jokes because it's such a boring process but that's good because that means only the real strong jokes are going to survive\nYeah and then I I also find it really fascinating the the headlines because the headlines are I mean there are viral onion or stories that people have never clicked on the actual story themselves it's just the headline that carries it right right well there are some\nUh headlines on the onion that don't come with stories ... ... you know because when you have your shortlist of headlines some of them have legs and you know that you can spend this out and write a story about others just my more you can say the headline says it also just go go with the headline or picture you know at best\n... we are talking with Scott daycares hot but the onion dot com and author and editor of welcome to the future which is mine by\nNot
