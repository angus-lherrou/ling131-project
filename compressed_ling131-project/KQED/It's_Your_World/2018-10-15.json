our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true\nWhere would you begin to realize very very early on a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts\nIs deeply deeply defined by class and by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire

Columbia is a person who has a real legal writing\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive status or broadening the definition of legal person to include animals because he's been dedicated to for nearly ... years ever since she read the book animal liberation and Peter Singer\nNow I read Peter Singer smoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless\nDescended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless in defense was that billions of non human animals\nAre and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realize that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal persons now at that time\nThere was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human animal I knew it was going to take a long time\n[noise] so your objective and that time was to essentially changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal person that was your goal that would be your\nDream that was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first lawsuits\nAnd that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much time to be done and as I began\nTo try to understand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal\nRights to animals [noise] came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nSummers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia [noise] not Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London\nAnd after he got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first thing he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because the Eighteenth century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help us and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the things bench and the demand is that he issue a common law written the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I have written figures corpus it's meant to protect\nAny of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if he could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two\nLord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in the order James Frey at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate shouldn't the free\nMan who walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your genes summers that of course a non human version of James hundreds and\nI started to look for my Jane Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James how much time we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of\nAll the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of [noise]\nAutonomous being to being slaves it's something that grinds against\nEvery idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could

who wish to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you're actually match the demographic profiles the countries and making sure you had gender bounds you'd

of working class people lots of fulltime ... to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better from my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it doesn't that already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes John how does somebody go\nI'm not I'm Sorry a constructive scratch the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams extra stuff is that it's just I just got my dog goes out and saying are the people who want political power as specifically that people who you should not let her political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nAnd in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah pollen in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one solution\nChamber once will tuition buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busily back stabbing each other and engaging the typical political outside and go well why do we need that for a but this is a path to old is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament tried to society of friends I think we should populated our parliament with randomly selected people\nRely jerky what if my neighbor gets chosen the food even separate his recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these Monday examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be the perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is\nSomething that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have out strategy a and that is yet to to get the students just simply happening more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k.\nGovernment is now putting aside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe it will spread\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try to\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not I think it will be easy to political changes
