I have to take back some um my childhood was complicated to say the least and I had developed a kind of mechanism kind of survival mechanism that um when\nWhen things got too overwhelming to me I sense pieces of myself that were overwhelmed with emotion and with\nYou know things I didn't understand symptoms what I write in about a new book\nI Would send it outside to tree that I can see it get to see the tree outside the window and titles that were very dangerous and frightening to me as a child eight nine ten eleven twelve and I can watch this tree and it was ... it was a sycamore and the leaves for Russell it sounded like rushing water\nAnd part of me would be in the room and most of me was out there\nSo I\nDeveloped this and it wasn't that I was civil I wasn't but I didn't the only time I could feel\nJust you know sort of ... literally none of them to to a degree\nUm except I can I Swear to God I can I Swear to God and um when I was doing the none um I which I didn't\nWant to do 'em at all because I had\nBy then started to see the you know little sliver of tomorrow a little sliver started to come in of\nThe of the perfect place if perhaps you know perhaps I'll perhaps um\nAnd then my stepfather came and I had turned down this series I didn't want to do it I mean it was Nineteen sixty six\nEverybody was running around naked and eating ... [laughter]\nI didn't want to be dressed as a ... [noise]\nI didn't necessarily want to be running around naked but I didn't want to be just as a no neither do the halfway to position [laughter] so I I I\nTurned it down and turned it down and then my step father came over and said if I if I didn't do it um they had called him and if I didn't do it might never work again\nAnd ... and I went oh really and I got scared so it was the beginning of of learning that every time I made a decision because I was scared it it wasn't the right one um\nAnd I felt defeated from day one I uh I\n... I started to be very depressed\nI didn't know that it was I was depressed because in Nineteen sixty six I didn't know what the question was um and maybe I maybe I Would have been all of this would have been bubbling up anyway because I'm becoming a young adult and whatever complicated childhood I had was confusing me and just coming out I don't know\nBut it ... it manifested itself and in eating disorders and um you know just didn't I didn't I didn't\nI went to a doctor and he put me on diets pills because of that at the time they could do that and they were like this big just straight Dexedrine and one of them okay now we're\nEverybody thought oh\nWhy did somebody tell me about this\nBut then when I hands were shaking so bad in a scene that I couldn't lift up a cup of tea in the scene because I looked like I was really not doing well I and I found myself from drinking\n[laughter]\nAll of a sudden I\nI put my hands and my face and I just sold it it just folded up\nAnd in in my head down in my lab\nI started whispering please let me go home please let me go home please let me go home and he kept trying trying to stop and voice inside my had said get up get up\nGet up just pop up and go well I don't know what that was it was weird [laughter] I\nCouldn't do it I couldn't make myself get up I just sat there saying he certainly go home please let me go home\nAnd all of a sudden I felt this arm on his hands you know pull up my arm not not like he was trying to pull me\nI'm pull my hands away or you know try to talk to me it was it was kind of a support like pulling me up and I heard this voice not loud but a voice that you\nDidn't argue with say get her car she finished the day and it was Madeline sure with the mother superior\nAnd she she led me I had my hands still in my face 'cause I was too embarrassed and to see how\nHorrified everybody must have been um and and she let me towards\nThe big sliding doors that open to the sound stage and I could hear the honk honk is the thing rolled open\nAnd and she\nPushed my head down I got him some vehicle that I never I never looked at the drive all the way home I was to mortified and then he took me home and I I think I was home the next day I come to work like\nEverybody how are you off you know everything's\nThey just ate that hotdog I shut up you know and it\nAnd then towards the end of that day Madeline pulled me into the back\nI'm into a dark corner in the corner and the sound stage and stuffed a piece of paper in my hand\nAnd she said the address is very close and you can you can come Tuesday after work\nI Will meet you there it's the actors studio ... do you know what it is and I said well yeah you know\nThinking nah not so much that I really know what it was but I kind of heard about it and she said I Will not take\nNo for an answer so I met her there\nAnd it was really um the beginning of a huge change in my life because\nI could then begin to hear myself again 'cause if I could get to the work I Would be All right it was when the war was taken away from me that I began to drown and um and then I started working at least offer very intensely and\nUm I desperately wanted to learn a craft and initially\nHe was quite taken with you he was it it seemed like another\nOf Providence would deliver you're going to but it did not entirely go that way with the stress where did it well it didn't it didn't it\nWas like he had it all planned out but um he was really a um a magnificent teacher but he could be a little rough\nHe could be rough and he could be and you know what we would sit in the ... and watch other scenes and sometimes you know you you feel the other ethical oh my God oh my God how to recover from that you know when when he would talk to some people and he from the get go\nWith me he was in credibly\nUm supportive and um I went ... you know as much as I could when I wasn't working and you know it was sort of known that I was one of his you know chosen ones or something and\nUm so I and I started eventually when the none was over I thank God\nI [laughter] I started\nI'm going to his then the ... Institute was he had and he and his wife and I had started so that I could work with him more intensely I think it was three times a week they were um just\nHim teaching and doing 'em exes extended exercises with just with Italy and and it was an extraordinary time and then one day as\nI'm also so striving to move my career on because it's going nowhere unless I make it go somewhere and I told myself that I could never blame the them the them\nThe industry the the the unfairness of it all the the the something it it could never be that if I wasn't worried want it to be it had to be because I wasn't good enough and that's when I got good enough\nThat would just change and it was just you know\nShe forward so slowly and one day I was doing a scene I'm friendly at the Institute\nAnd you were supposed to um be generous enough to win another actor asked you to be in a scene with that even though it was something you did not want to do in a million ... million years you just did it anyway and did your best because you were supposed to participate with your fellow students\nAnd I had done that with them and not just to to ask me to to play in a in a two character play called the horror of the ... player I think it is and of course I was not the whore\nI was it was supposed to be like the two sides of the same person um and one of them was like the Marilyn Monroe ish character and one of them was the none\nCharacter which one she wanted me to fight [noise]\nCarrots [noise] gas which one she wanted me to fight [noise] and so automatically I didn't want to do it but I ... you know I was you know going to do the best they could in the ... but I wasn't\nReally taking it seriously and I and then I was kind of hockey I was kind of shared myself with lead well you know\nJust going to do a little fancy footwork chair and all you know a fair and I'll be just you know that's all everybody with that\nAnd I'm Lee first talk to 'em my cello um after\nAnd he seemed very kind and then when you work at the actors studio what it was after you do a senior supposed to say you know when Lee or ... or whoever the moderator as you're supposed to talk about what you were working on because it's never finished product it's always a work in progress\nSecret is working on very specific aspects of a character I'm there and sometimes they seem so obscure I ... I Would want to say that the actors were a little more reasonable thing to be working on but what whatever you know [laughter] um\nAnd he'd ask my fellow after what she was working on and she said something and he was very keyed seemed very generous and so he turned to me and and before he even asked me what I was working and he says when are you going to stop this\nAnd it was ... years we went into a huge\nSo much as the book was trying to see it so clearly for me because they're the patterns that in childhood sort of a ... there were survival mechanisms but as an adult\nThey get on my way they've gotten my way and they no longer serve me and I can't I Can't untangle them um there's a saying that what's what's fired together is wired together um um\nThat's with love for me the legal stuff man he was literally a rash manner yes so you know it's taken it takes me it's taken me a lifetime to figure out how I can just connect those two because wait a minute that's\nThose two don't really go together Sally can still have a relationship with somebody and not feeling danger on the line\nWhile the other big figure a course in this in this triangulation is your mother who and what she knew or didn't know during during the course of this and it's and it's very moving the way you write at the end\nYou're coming to some accommodation with us or not necessarily to complete your models sweetness and light what happens between your mother but you you you love your mother is deeply um and in the complex way that the mothers and daughters sometimes is particularly when there's abuse happening I'm the\nMother knew something but didn't know at all it's it's really quite um it's quite extraordinary and I just I Wonder if it's as you were writing it did you know all of these things before you could I mean did you discover known from the writing\nBut I discovered in the writing I discovered so much in the writing and it was hard to do is hard to get it was hard to move away from it became you know addicted to it\nI'm ... and I I\n... you know I Would have it in my pockets and my shoes at ... because I didn't\nWant to be away from it and I'd be drawn a way to go to work and do other things which was probably a good idea\nAnd I come back and it would be sort of fresh but I I\nThe big ingredient the big things I was looking for I didn't discover until I made myself go back and look at I made myself\nRead my journals that I hadn't written something I had written a\nVery key thing in my journal um you know only like Fifteen\nYears prior to this and I wrote it down\nI wrote it down and completely\n... from my brain and yet something in me knew I needed to write it down and it was only in doing this that I went wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute\nWait one minute and went and found a journal and went and got went\nOh my God and could peace some things together that we're in pieces [laughter] um and I understand um and I think ultimately what I was looking for was\nWhat I felt about my mother um I did not want to feel\nUm that she had left\nAnd ah um\nThat she wouldn't taught me first I needed to haunt me and then I I thought do I am I feeling angry\nI don't know and then ultimately I'm at the very end and when I done all of this for seven years and I was sitting with my youngest son Sam I'm who is the only one who I'd let read ... ... actually\nI Would read it to him as I was putting the last chapter trying to figure out where how it fit together\nAnd they said Sam what'd I Do all of this what is this about what did I learn at just that I've looked for something and I always find that I still don't know what it was and he said\nOh my God do you see how different you are and then you were seven years ago how differently you feel about yourself\nAnd I went oh God\nYes you're right I Do and that really is the end of the book it's the last understanding of it that I write I'm about my mother and um I realized that they\nDidn't need her to haunt me uh I'm fine without her and that\nSomeday she will come and get me [noise]\nLet me just switch gears all them ask you about some of the people that you've worked with her but here's one of your co stretch you mentioned Joanne Woodward and civil gas\nTalk a little bit about what the I mean it's such a [noise] the two of you it's just to do wedding that yeah and that's just really mark will tell me about working with with her on on said well\nShe um and I was lucky enough to later and work with her fence phenomenal husband Paul I mean\nThey were this this extraordinary couple she was so she was so\nEverything that I wanted to be um she was a real actor that's really all she cared about\nShe never cared about you know being famous or looking really pretty or she just one of the work get me to the work and she boy did she know how to work and she was just\nDead on and there was no um there was no ego involved it was always about the scene and I'm ... I've been lucky enough to work with a few people like that\nBut um I think Joanne Joanne really was the first and um you know she just was one of the few people in my life really you know sit here take my hand and I got it and uh so I she just as a\nAs a gym no you un rod leaving her grade in in order to raise really is a great or it's just a great you know this Jewish classic Jewish guy from New York and and the character that you play\nThat there's real ... chemistry was sort of cliche there's something more than ... physics going on in the two of you what what was it like working with with him on that\nHe was you know he's again a wonderful guy and a wonderful actor but I think the chemistry that you see between run and I is really I'm already written I ... um and you know inflates through Ron I'm because ... was ...\nYou know played through Ron I'm because ... was came into my life than he was such a huge influence in my life from then on um [noise] and so it's it's interesting um that\nHe he's so I'm ... rats and self around a\nA performance and that and I'm In a production but he's never eat in a different take over it or anything but\nUm I think the the Enron and I really loved working with each other but\nI was seeing Marty when I Lived at Ron ... I'm\nNot how I adored him\nWith with the the most influential director for you what you're saying\n[noise] Ah yes no absolutely no evidence even though I've been lucky enough to work with some wonderful directors but he it was the role in and how we and how he um enabled me and he had come from the actors\nStudio and and I'm the same way that you know they've he he had\nIt was close friends with Leon 'cause then and all that and he had a language that I understood and I didn't have to decipher his language\nTo into my own I'm acting language and he saw the exactly the same acting language and so it was fun for us to to play chess games with each other and see if we get out maneuver each other you know and\nI don't know that I ever really quite\nAgain ... ...\nAh when Lincoln the puppy of Lincoln came up you that determination that you've been talking about really went into high gear you are determined to get that part and originally Liam Neeson was\nWas cast in the role and you went after you've really lobby Spielberg that you wanted to play this role\nAnd it looked like it might slip out of your hands and by God you weren't going to let it happen right you are you sort of pretty much insisted audition for him\nI'm Daniel Day Lewis of course famously you know stays in the ... what was it like for you working with a remarkable after he was a particular we'll see I ... I\nThat I mean that's perfect for me I left that um I Would ... you know in my own little way um I always would stay in character but I Would always hide it because I never felt I had the power to be Daniel Day Lewis and to take over and say everybody's got to follow these rules you know and\nSo everybody all the roads around ... and ... everybody lives alone um\nAnd you know and and and I and he's ... he's a phenomenal guy um but he he made it so that when we came on the set\nThere were no cruise around it was all set up so you didn't you didn't ever 'em ramble in in in ... and and and feel the contemporary world around you you know the\nCrew wasn't allowed to come up and said did you see that tell them anything unless I never you were just in this world of the White House and\nUm so and Daniel you sort of demanded that he and Steven it's decided that and and um\nAs everybody else in the cast conform to that but they didn't\nThey did a lot of a lot of actors would complain\nThey complained to me I don't think they complain to Daniel I Would I be chatting I wear my shoes on this after my\nFeet are you know [laughter] but I\nJust loved it I mean that's there it is that's that is the you know the the totality of it how deeply can you convince said this to being this other character and I love the fact that he does that what", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Your World", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
