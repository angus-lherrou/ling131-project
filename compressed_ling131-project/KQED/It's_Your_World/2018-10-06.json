carrying diverse views on important topics of the day who would've thought that chain have a nice day could be controversial [noise] get Harvard professors team\nHas been receiving a lot of resistance to the message that this is a nice day we're more specifically that it's the best time to be alive because of the wealth and will be around the corner along with a decline to learn more about the reasons for his optimism it's just so much\nWe invited Dr ... to make his case he was in conversation with ... hari to be seen wiring minds pod cast this program has generously supported by the Kennan

to tonight's program at the commonwealth club [noise] my name's ... hari and I'm pleased to be a moderator for tonight's program joining us this evening is the one and only Steven Pinker Johnstone family professor of psychology at Harvard University and author of the best selling book enlightenment now\nDr ... an experimental cognitive psychologist in enlightenment now explores the progress that humanity has made through enlightenment thinking while today's world can be characterized by hyper polarization disintegrating discourse and the degradation of facts he argues that the world is actually improving\nSo please join me now in walking Dr Steven Pinker [noise]\n\nAll right Steve I made the mistake of opening Twitter before I came out here and now I don't feel like the world isn't a good place [laughter]\nWhich I think a key feature of the of that ad you spend a lot of time arguing the reverse that this is one of this might be the greatest time to be alive how so\nPeople are living longer and what's more fundamental than life\nPeople are a wealthier and I don't mean the one percent but I mean the bottom ten percent that rates of extreme poverty has been plunging by about three quarters and just the last three decades a race of literacy has\nIncreased about Ninety percent of the world's population under the age of twenty five can read and write\nRates of death in from all forms of violence are in decline there are fewer people were killed in war in this decade\nThan nineties the eighties seventies sixties fifties to say nothing of the world's worst rates of violent crime has been declining including violence against women\nSo in most measures of human well being you see improvements over a span of decades and centuries\nIf I knew it wasn't a mistake and you sound like a hyper optimist to me actually is that the point of this book you\nKnow the point actually is not optimism that all the point is I knowing the fact\nThat it's not a question of well if if global poverty has fallen to um ten percent should we constantly ... she would be happy about the Ninety percent or upset about the ten percent factors we should note that the numbers are Ninety percent and ten percent most people don't know that most people when asked\nIs poverty across the world extreme poverty increasing or decreasing majorities say increasing or staying the same the correct answers energy decreasing\nThere isn't a question of optimism there's the question is just knowing facts like life is the rate of death in warfare higher or lower now than it was saying the Nineteen eighties now it's not a question of being optimistic that there are fewer wars are pessimistic but they're still in a off of wars\nUh being optimistic that there are fewer wars are pessimistic but there's still an awful wars in Syria and Yemen and elsewhere it's a question just knowing which way the world is is going what are\nThe late Swedish doctrine ... recalls fact fullness\nFullness I like knowing what the facts are now now should we be a wife is going to call me full of facts later [laughter] how I feel about it why a return\nTo the enlightenment of all the periods of human history to have that kind of crawl back towards whiny light minutes been two hundred plus years since\nYou know it's it's not it's not it's not a return is not calling back it's not you know make bringing bringing back the layman to it's a question of affirming [noise] a a set of ideals that were most articulate plea stated I during their life and it's not that are still relevant namely reason science and humanism\nLet's start to unpack those ideals but first to a minor history lesson what made those ideas emerge at that time\nSo we we it's it's a hard question to answer because it only happened once and so without any historical is that we can't replace that it's fair to tape a number of times and and the number of ways I find that went different directions depending on what meat have proceeded it\nBut a possibly the rise of print and literacy and that if you were to look at something that happened before the say the second half of the Eighteenth century it's that's when you want to more or less central to the uh the the light mix\nUm it was an era in which the\nPopulation of European countries surpass fifty percent literacy for the first time in history\nThere was a time at which the cost of putting a book or a pamphlet plummeted us those greater mobility of people and ideas it made the historical memory of the wars of religion of the um sixteenth century sixteenth and seventeenth century\nFact people realize that killing people by the tens of millions depending on their interpretation of the holy trinity\nProbably isn't the best way to run a society in part it was the fruits of the scientific revolution which showed that a lot of\n... human beliefs were were were outright false of rich birth or the faith belief that the sun rose revolves around the earth is maybe the most famous example and perhaps the the results has uh the age of exploration that they were all of these continents\nThat teeming with life with people's with a different cultures that\nPeople didn't even know existed until a century before that expanded people psoriasis so all of these things they don't really know what was the cause but um but they all seemed to come together\nAnd I want to unpack some of these ideas now so when you say reason I think that means something different nowadays than what you want you unpack in the book we what do you mean by reading\nRationality logic\nLA it does not in good yeah\nRationality logic as opposed to\nAs opposed to dogma as opposed to parsing scriptures as opposed to authority as opposed to conventional wisdom or\nAs opposed to bad feelings that the feeling of subjective certainty and I think the glow of of a feeling that you're in the right because you're you and your your um this Internet infallible or that someone else who you admire says that they are ... are infallible superstitions\nA dog my fair\nSo those are all alternatives to reason and science I\nThink the science the application of reason to the the natural world so not all of reason to science because there's also logic is also mathematics is also a moral arguments about when you apply reason to the way the way things work that we call it science\nAnd then the the one that I I think most people haven't haven't heard of or at least on packages of humanism\nYeah so human is that it's just the idea that the ultimate moral good is to promote human well being that is the the health\nHappiness the longevity the knowledge the experience of\nMen women and children and other animals but we'll we'll we'll begin with humans as opposed to now you can say well who could be opposed to that I mean who could be against people living longer in and out of\nHealthy urine and\nHaving enough to each well there are alternative moral systems such as the ultimate good is to carry out God's commandments or to maximize the glory of the nation or the race or or the creed so even though it may seem to be completely unacceptable but you do what makes the most people better off\nI'd actually in a way it's kind of a radical idea\nTwo hundred academics who signed a statement in support of Trump a ... a couple of months prior to the two thousand sixteen election and the ideas behind Trump is an art counter and like the idea is there's no such thing as a humanity there just tribes are there is zero sum competition between tribes\nTo surrender national interest to global cooperation is to be a chump in a battle of ... a tribe against tribe race against race so he's our ideas I think they're they're terrible ideas but they are ideas and the west\nBy no means ah ever a shooter decides is the debate is gone within the west\nSo did you write this book in response to the rise of a Trump ism as you put it this tribalism that was emerging [noise]\nNo I I Do not have the outset although I did have to incorporate that uh the I I began the book in two thousand Fifteen I signed a contract for the book in two thousand Thirteen and so the idea that Donald Trump the president was a it came out of The Simpsons quite literally\nI mean it was it was absurd at the time\nThe Simpsons has proven to be quite pressure you well yeah [laughter]\nUh so it didn't require and this is a pretty uh pretty conspicuous elephant in the room that I could not ignoring a book on progressing so I had to deal with the uh it forced me to confront the fact that the that the west right up to the president has not been synonymous with enlightenment so what\nAre the ones where are you seeing around twenty Thirteen twenty Fifteen Hi Mose yeah it did inspire either\nSo we were in in a in a sense and lightning now was something of a sequel to the better angels of our nature the book that I published in two thousand eleven which was inspired by my coming across many datasets showing that rates of violence had been and historical declined\nA ... you can't come to from reading the news because news covers violence wherever it occurs does not cover tend to cover non violence you don't see any reporter saying I'm reporting a\nLive from a school that's not going to shut up\nOr a country that's a piece you don't see a headline saying a Southeast Asia has had a war for Thirty years but\nIt say let's go streets clean things you don't see on the news yeah\nWhen you when you plot rates of violence overtime ... that's when you see a decline because a rate of violence number of people\nKilled per hundred thousand per year includes both the people who are killed in the numerous during the people who aren't killed that go into the drama Nader and that's when you can appreciate\nSomething that otherwise could elude architecture so the better angels of our nature was on a six historical declines of violence and when I completed a book then I realized that they were actually we went to take that mindset\nActually we went to take that mindset\nAssessing the world by quantitative measures overtime not over reports of things that go wrong because things will always go wrong there the ... the world will never be perfect or be dangerous to try to make it perfect\nAnd you just simply can't have any idea as to whether things are improving or not unless you look at data well if you look at data if you expand the day to look at from violence\nTo other measures of human well being such as nutrition such as infectious disease such as leisure time such as a democracy such as longevity such as literacy all of those are going in a positive direction too and no one seemed to know about it\nSo we're kind of psychologist why do I feel those trends then because when I Know about this I I can look at the data and say oh yeah human lifespan is increasing and has been\nFor a long period of time now you know we've flattened out in the last couple of years here in the U.S but by and large it's been going up I don't feel that way I feel the the oncoming approach of\nOf obesity and uh uh the rise and type two diabetes etc it might not just predisposed to good news\nThere well there is um [noise] there's I think there is some systematic reasons why we're our our understanding of the world was disconnected from from a reality one of them is a feature of human psychology called the ability or a stick that's a term from a ... Daniel Kahneman\nThat we often assess probability risk danger by how easily examples come to mind how vivid images how striking a narrative since what the news does this report things that happen not things that don't happen and the things that happen are more likely to be\nNegative and positive you don't have a headline that hundred and thirty seven thousand people whiskey from extreme poverty yesterday\nAlthough the papers could have run that headline every day for the last Thirty years as max ... pointed out\nActually combined the nature of news which is to report things that go wrong with nature of cognition which is to be\nUm affected by the end of the images and narratives and stories were not as news gathering becomes more efficient we're guaranteed to almost to think that things are getting worse even if as getting better that's one reason\nAnd putting on my scientists at ... or we evolved in ... in our evolutionary history is that a a situation that we're we're naturally predisposed to because our brains aren't moving at the state at the speed of a news if you will in term yes it is it's development\nYeah I think that's right that the uh data sets really didn't exist until quite recently where we're naturally numerous the arithmetic mathematics are recent inventions in human history as a existed for a fraction of the ... when the nonhuman it's not\nCatastrophic the fact that our mind goes with\nThe examples in anecdotes because after all those are\nAre not only available\nBefore the existence of literacy and data gathering organizations but they do reflect local conditions or\nAs a not a bad first approximation it it really is true that there are more pigeons city than than non white breasted nuthatches and you know that without having to do a bird census you don't have to look a day that you've just consult your your image is not the case where your images are are are correct and they often are correct\nBut not when it comes to a world of seven billion people\nYeah so this is the one of the things that struck me as if that doesn't come naturally to us this idea of of thinking in the world in these hyper rational ways through the lens of data because we are human we are predisposed to our evolutionary roots\nAren't you asking us to take a little bit of a leap of faith\nWell to to think this way\nNo it's not a leap of faith ... sweep of education it's the opposite of a leap of faith or that is we [noise]\n\nIt it certainly does require a inhibiting certain impulses and insects not calling with our our our gut feelings to uh to allow our best state our best reason Arthur fruits of our educational system to override our intuitions\nI just think back to um I Can't remember exactly when but George W. Bush talking about leading from his good and um how tractor but that was\nTo see a leader talk about it that way you describe like the leaders that we should really be attracted to are the ones that speak to reason and science because they're going to be grounded in progress is is that a fair assessment of of your of your point\nYeah so the fact that the policy should be based on rational analysis for sure I Know of course a politician in a democracy in order to be elected has to appeal to people with all of their biases and emotions and intuitions so skilled politician\nOr an admirable politician would be one who combines the most rational analysis of policy with the greatest skill in\nThe attention and support of a of the people in the country so it would they don't recall the person or demagogue ah when they do and that that's probably been the best we can hope for and leadership and a democracy\nOr the best we can hope for a few like that is resident right now um [noise]\nWhy go back two hundred years that timeline teams arbitrary on some point I understand you were going back to the enlightenment but why not fifty years ago or or more realistically for us the even the last ten to twenty because I tend not to\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info sessions will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ... maybe even ten years ago\nWell the thing is that these these trends are\nVisible not just over centuries but over decades and over the years I mean not all of them there's always like almost that can be reversals that can be sickening lectures but going back to sake stream poverty or as I mentioned that is a hundred and thirty seven thousand people a day for the last Thirty years of escaped extreme poverty\nUm when it comes to war and democracy just in my own lifetime I mean I I when I was a college student world had thirty one democracies today as a hundred and three there were wars to kill people at a rate from nine hundred thousand per year now the rate is about one point for for a hundred thousand per year\nSo these aren't centuries I mean I'm I'm not that old time but this is a [laughter] [laughter]\nOh this was a biography about now so I get not everything\nI have long had the sense that ah intellectuals thought pessimism was the more serious point of view yeah and you're offering something ... you're saying you're offering a rebuke against that idea yeah um\nIt talked about that a little bit your your thoughts are on pessimism a in a spend up on that and the thing\nYeah there is an a on a tendency to give more um ... some credence to to pass them is a there is a financial aid to Morgan house on said that a pessimist sound like they're trying to help you optimist sound like they're trying to sell you something\nThis may be a reflection of another a psychological feature they some of the negativity ... virus that bad ways um\nThe called the negativity but by us that bad ways a more heavily than good we are\nWe drive losses more than we look forward to gains a criticism steam was more than praise a booms ah we\nAh remember recent bad events that have been recent good events and so that may open up a nice for people to remind us of bad things that we may have overlooked and so we do a\nA scribe greater moral seriousness to to pass on this or\nThat the biblical profits or or a good example we consider them both\nMoral and they warned us imminent do it's easy it's it's kind of cheap and easy to be a pessimist 'cause there'll always be things that go wrong and you can if you assemble a list of all the worst things that are happening anywhere on the planet any given time it's who is going to look pretty depressing\nNow of course something ... tons of things do get worse is not this is not an argument for optimism in the sense that we should always believe things get better things don't always get better and then there's no reason to believe that they will left to their own devices [noise]\nIt's a brother that we should have the most accurate assessment that we can half of the state of the world and the direction that it's going to try to identify what it is that makes things better and do more of them\nI'm being allergic but I ... in my house I grew up and we'd watch the news every night and it wasn't good news back then we'd watch Peter Jennings on ABC and there is always bad news they left one segment at the end that was sort of the good news\nBut it does feel like there is a prevailing sense when I turn on the news now that it feels more pessimistic than ever yeah why are we seeing a trend line in that around and with the coverage of the narratives that we see out there\nThere is a good question and it and it um you know I had to be careful not to say ... fall into my own trap and say well the the news is getting worse or with their their news getting more pessimistic without any data and so I did find that there is a a data scientist named ...\nWho did a a random algorithm fat tallied up the number of positive and negative words news stories in the New York times and in a sample of a global new services since the Nineteen forties\nAnd found that in fact been it has gotten more more pessimistic suggest those people are living longer and there's and and I received death and war been going down and race if literacy even going down the news will be getting more and more morose and so this is a factor says and just stay there ...\nWho's leading the horse there is that reflective of something that we writ large as the public is inspiring the media to red light of that or is it the reverse\nIt's a good question if it was just the negativity bias in human nature that would protect that there should be a trend toward greater pessimism 'cause human nature or hasn't changed in the last Seventy years\nI it may be a combination of our greater ability to gather news that we can send 'em well we don't represent news crews new news teams to the remote corners of the world now everyone with a smartphone as I can can beam\nVideo footage to the to the Web instantaneously is partly paradoxically the I'm\nKind of a gift of are expanding circle of empathy that we care more about people and not just people other organisms and parts of the world that may have fallen ... these are radar in the past so we care more about famines and Africa\nAnd wars in in in now Yemen their ancestors may happen little kids being bullied and um [noise] women being sexually harassed which used to happen but just wasn't an issue now it is an issue\nUm and and the third a possible answer your questions that there is a change I think in the culture of journalism\nWhere it's considered increasingly ah especially since the seventies I think that the\nUh mores of of of responsible journalism all were as increasingly been to point out what's going wrong to speak truth to power to to break the mock\nA and that they were saying they're saying revulsion I think in the culture of journalism to the old style of uh being complicit with um power structure is not to show Roosevelt from the waist down because it would he would look as presidential\nTo overlook JFK's affairs to kind of be cheerleaders for the government now\nIt's the other way around perhaps even gone to an extreme where I\nEvery certificate institution is considered it'd be a target for an aggressive takes down and there's a kind of cynicism that nothing can ever work everything is corrupt which may have had punishes consequences\nBut there has been some criticism of your book a you're not that isn't new to you I'm In one of the criticisms came from from the right especially the religious right who saw this as a rebuke of the role of faith in society a and I'm curious what your thoughts were\nYeah I I don't think that things have civil society I mean there's not a safe in the sense of bleeding something without a reason now this doesn't mean that there is no role for religious institutions in society and religious institutions\nI have a vault um many of them have become more humanistic even if they don't necessarily use that word but um [noise] but yeah I don't think that that any collective decision should be based on a\nOn faith in the sense of the leading something without a good reason on the basis of traditional dogma or authority so\nWhat could be the role of religious institutions going forward then like what opportunities do you see for them it in a world that is is driven by a latent ideal\nWorld religions have a um a rich historical legacy they they are they sit on them\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info sessions will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nUm institutions they can be so sorry for 'em communal uh experience with people getting together and enjoying the warmth of the community the reassurance of tradition the beauty of a liturgy and music and I can August they are that can be\nCivil society civil society movements to a charities um support for I'm at risk youth\nProviders of of health and mental health services in parts of the world with very weak civil society organizations they can be involved in I'm In a peacemaking peacekeeping and justice and rule of law\nI'm some really there's a ... as legacy institutions that command a great deal of loyalty there is a potential for for which is to be positive forces what they ... what what I Would call in and it's not not just me but maybe it's just not to base I any of the morality on\nDog my authority scripture but just to to justify that health is good at peace is good and living together is good and tolerance is good and I ... to the extent that these institutions dedicate themselves to those humanistic values than they can be massive forces for good\nYou've also face withering criticism from um opponents on the left\nOr you are a professor on a campus he's still teach courses and you've been highly critical of politically correct environments on campus and and you even posted that given rise to some uh some elements in our society that are completely undesirable can you talk about that\nYeah um I think the ah ... horror I have had\nA former students who have gravitated to the ... All right um so these are not ignoramus says these are not skinheads um these are\nAre in some cases and extremely intelligent articulate ah people but they have often been repelled by\nOf um of of um politically correct dogma on American campuses uh and and in in certain American media and often when they come across politically incorrect I'm a\nThe entire establishment tends been systematically repressing um [noise] a\nFacts and feel emboldened that the exact opposite of the establishment must have\nA greater be much more in tune to the to the to the truth\nAnd therefore often embrace a extreme an unjustified interpretations of certain facts that simply can't be discussed\nAnd therefore we're never inoculated to them ... against the most extreme interpretation so all I wanted to be concrete um the idea that that men and women are indistinguishable at our except for social isolation that the babies are born ah identical", "show_name": "It's Your World", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "06"}
