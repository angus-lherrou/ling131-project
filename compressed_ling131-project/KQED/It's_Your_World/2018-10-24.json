I Would invite you to be in my\nPerfect world for a minute where it's past twenty twenty and the Democrats of taking back the house they repealed everything that's gone wrong in the last year and a

[noise]\nI made it sound like you have to write something something really hard you know\n... you mean everything's already repealed everything is perfect is that what you're saying everything's already perfect that I Would say\nI'm finished [laughter] and get on that swelled plane which surely he does not deserve um\n[noise] you know there are as you know I mean\nThere there's not five minutes go by that you don't think someone has to fix that like it is inconceivable although it just happened that the president of the United states addresses the UN and his laughed\nI mean\nIt's that's pretty astonishing especially to me who as a child I had to childhood idols one was Leonard Bernstein and ...\nUm you probably heard Lenovo design humid out of ... he was the director general of the UN um I have as many books by that ... have this photograph on my refrigerator\nUm and so I always think what would that commercial think of this um when I was a child or when they took a class you know from school for a tour of the un and I know when I was like maybe nine years old and I was incredibly excited because I thought I Would see that commercial\nUm and I had a book by about ... and I brought it with me and we're walking around the UN and they can figure out who's going to see him and\nSo a man in his shoe walk by and I thought it was that camera shows so I have left the line we were always marsh around like my height and there's a lot and I listen line and went after him and then I couldn't find them because there were many men in suits and I couldn't tell which one he was and so I pushed a door\nTo where I thought he'd gone through and every alarming the UN went on\n[noise]\nI up a policeman came over and I burst into tears and I said there wasn't that much security though that obviously if I was even able to do this and I kept saying I showed Dick how much will they thought it was shut down how much will the guy didn't really know who their coverage for was um [noise]\nSo that for me the un I once spoke at the un not to the general assembly um and I was incredibly excited to be at the un I'm Donald Trump um\n... you may have missed dish but before he was president his only comment about the UN was he didn't like the marble tile and that he could get some a better deal [noise] on the marble trial um so\nYou know put your knocking on your lap don't put your head don't reach over someone do grab or less has all the chef nonstop dishes my childhood summed up I Would say to my mother can I please have an apple and my mother would say marriage they have an apple\nAnd I would say that we have an apple and she was eight no\n[noise] so consequently I had excellent matters\nThe most I get home for in that regard is I have lately been trying to bring back the phrase you're\nWelcome because here's what happened down so much says thank you for coming than the other person says thank you for having me Oh thank you for comes and goes on forever [noise]\nHow I've lately been saying that people will say thank you for coming I'll say You're welcome and they look at me like you are so rude [noise]\nIf you mean civility like in the Senate is apparently there was there was this time where these senators walked off arm in arm\nIt's apparently there was that there was a time where the senators walked off arm in arm you know and some wonderful or a friendship I'm certainly must have been better than it is now\nI'm there that would certainly be better um you know that there's constant talk about how partisan politics have become um is it in a way kind of funny I mean\nPolitics partisan politics is redundant you no apologies\nAre part of it and that's the point of holidays that's about as um the problem with politics is not that they're part isn't the problem with politics the Republicans [noise]\n\nI'm would you please tell us a little bit about your participation in law and order [laughter] um\nSo I helped her that's what I please tell you or at least her um [laughter] about my participation law and order which was a TV show um where\nI played um I'd a I'm a recurring part as an arraignment judge 'em I got this part by begging them\nTo give me this heart [noise] um\nI I knew I pay the murders into play the police captain him and uh that that that I met ... who invented this thing and I should put me on that I I Love Law Order I still love law and order I Love it there is not the only thing I Know that other people find other ways were lashed yoga buys you know [noise]\nI'm not the spy already might imagine but whatever that music is it done others like so we\nI hear that I become the Dalai Lama [noise]\n\nBecome instantly relaxed and one of my biggest injections you know the president a popular culture is why there is not a law and order channel [noise]\nBig guys that's the only thing I ever want to see on television\nIs water and show they actually first I'm a we're getting images part as a real judge 'em and I had to go and audition for it and the producers sit there and I I did the audition and I knew I was horrible and the second I stopped I should look I Know I was really bad\nI should you know if this person too big for me I'm don't give me this part\nGive me an arraignment judge part because that's a really brief by two sentences\nAnd the British had a friend actors don't Shay I Know I failed the audition so give me a different part I said I Know but I'm not an actor so I can say it so they didn't give me this part\nIt was fantastic because first of all you have to wear the judicial robe\nWhich the law and order was done on film show it was just like shooting a movie shows you know the work days even if you were on for two minutes or like you know twelve sixteen hours you'd be there forever I'm just checking I Would arrive I Would go to the wardrobe department put on my ... they would say friends you don't have the robot now oh that joking\nI don't I don't know [noise] and I remember\nThey shot it and in Chelsea Studios which are on the river where\nThey were judged started then to build now it's finished unfortunately this past you know for people to like ride bicycles and skateboard and like it's like the whole city turn into some summer camp\n[laughter] [noise] and I was outside smoking cigarettes where am I robe\nAnd this kid came ... down on a skateboard this kid with like a million tattoos and piercings and he saw me and he stopped like that\nAnd he said I didn't know if there was of course here\nAnd I said there's a court everywhere\n[noise]\nSo I really love I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed being a law and order I I also real ... every other judge on TV copied me because when you said at the bench which is the best she'd ever in any room in the world\nYou know you sit there you're hired then everyone else you have a real comfortable chair and you want to gamble\nBecause the gavel is there I took like begging the gavel\nAnd I instantly got dozens of letters from lawyers and judges many from judges you are not supposed to gamble you are not gamble as a verb by the way to judge you are not supposed to gamble is less there is an outburst or something of the room um however now every single television judge ...\n[noise]\nIt's just in Arizona simple thing you can't not ... I Can't tell you what a pleasurable thing that she is thinking\nIn your hand that stuff to other people from talking\n[noise]\nThis is from the back of the center of the orchestra I shake as you had ... I I remember seeing in you a star excuse me I remember seeing you on the documentary parents as burning and I wanted to know what you thought about route Paul and the drug scene becoming more popular\nI apparently in Paris was burning which I think that was made like twenty five year I mean it was really a long time ago um I'd forgotten about it is apparently been revived it because of lots of people who are young talk about this movie um [noise] uh\nI I Know we're Paul I mean I've actually met ripple is is a TV show right\nThe drags it wherever you ride that is that got contest for drug wings which is now on television I mean we could kind of thing that used to be like a very covert thing because it was against the law so it was very covert it was extremely different and now it's on television and this is apparently the most progress we can hope for\nYou know so I made [noise]\nI have nothing against people find that entertaining um she's kind of funny as a person um\nHe is still so many call he I'm assuming I mean\nDisrespect hum and ... but in the seventies for instance uh sometimes I Would be at a ...\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by Sandy from Comcast it's been at the Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\n'cause you could not walk on the street like that you'd be arrested you could not be on the subway like that you know only candy could do that because people thought that she was a girl\nShe didn't really look like a girl but never occurred to anyone that a man with a life that\nYou know so there was an upside to this depression by the way I'm which is that you know she could walk around like that um I Know that now it's like a it's so interesting that we live in a country I think this was a very popular TV show\nUm which means that many many people in the country like this and think it's fine and it's okay and they still vote for Donald Trump\nShow you know these things are not always how they look you know this is not always a sign of you know being pro Russian I'm at\nThe ... purchase burning was about um [noise] I Can't see what it's called them these contest\nVoting that's right so those ... things I used to go to them on they were ... they were fantastically interesting because they're completely invented you know that uh and I remember that when I did interview for Paris's burning 'em a lot of people that we're talking about that then you know\nImagine to me what was interesting about it was that it was a mistake and at that time for some kind of a ... and what did you have the it's the opposite is desire to be conventional that causes that not the desire to be rebellious\nYou know you don't have to be rebellious if everyone already hate you show that I think there's just things that people don't really understand about this so it's interesting\nTo me that it ended up as like a popular network television show 'em and I was very popular I don't think that real voting exist anymore there's no way that it could be 'cause you could afford to rent those places high friend I'd I'd\nLove to know your take on the me too movement\nOkay she left it on my take on me too movement because you think that might have some contrary opinion like that idea or um\nFish is one of these things that I have found some pretty surprising you know I never imagined this would happen not necessarily in years because being a woman was the shame from like IV [noise] until like six months ago\n\nSo naturally\nIt never occurred to me this one ever change\nYou know and show it ... it really changed I mean the first you know I don't know the first dozen guys who got caught I Know every single one of them personally and if you told me one minute before that these guys would be gone I Would never religion ... years\nNow and in a million years now have to say I mean like Harvard for instance", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Your World", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "24"}
