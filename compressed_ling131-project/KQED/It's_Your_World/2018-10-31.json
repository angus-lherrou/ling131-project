about which the town's real estate agents love to speculate the house had been on the market for more than a year the rumor being at the sellers father had put out a warning that no one should buy

over again that I did not have children he would glance passed me into the living room with a look on his face it said and why do you need all this space\nWhen the marriage ended and the house was sold with it when everything the house was supposed to become I moved to Nebraska single and singing the praises of renting forever\nThat is until ... intervened a financial planner she'd been

have the best of intentions and still things might not work out but that doesn't mean you of wasted your time or failed\nMany people who choose divorce are completely fine with it because they know the difference between the idea and reality of love\nThey know there was nothing to be gained from staying in a marriage simply because the idea of love demands pretending everything is fine when such

anything as diverse compare [laughter] um but there\nAren't a lot of black people here and so you might want to go toward Oakland where there is a firebrand flat you know [noise]\nUm at least for socializing and when you find community you will be able to share your grief with other people who are going to understand exactly what you mean and that can be really really useful and then also the Internet I find a lot of community online because for until recently I've lived in the middle of nowhere\nAnd so when I wanted to talk about these kinds of things I found black friends on the Internet and it sounds a little silly but it's been invaluable to me to be able to talk about that when you live in a while not any more but until the first I Lived in um Lafayette, Indiana\nWhich there are not a lot of black people they're either and it's so it was really useful to develop a community on line of black people so that when these things happen\nTo develop a community online of black people

me and many others how do we reconcile or many hunger is how do you do that\n[noise] oh that's a great question I don't the older I get the more I recognize that I'm allowed to have hunger\nAnd that it's okay to satisfy those hunger is a within moderation my dad loves to talk about moderation walks on everything in moderation okay and I'm always like [noise]\nI got it um [noise]\nBut it's true I think that a lot of the reason that we see so many people having such unhealthy relationships to joy to food to sex\nTo to to vice\nIs because we're told not to have any we deprive ourselves of so much that could make life a little easier and and so I'm working on just indulging when I Want and um my nutrition of has been really into this thing called intuitive eating which is exactly what it sounds like\nAnd it should be that complicated\nBut it's been really useful like when you are craving something allow yourself to have it deprivation never works out and\nSo that's how I'm working on reconciling my hunger\nAnd uh in terms of comfort food I really love Italian food and I would love to share a good um set of ravioli with a friend or lasagna anything with carbohydrate\nCheese tomatoes and more cheese [noise]\nI think from where she is yeah especially when it's\n... and it starts pulling and it's just like oh this is sex right now\n[noise] thank you\nFor that is that You're

moment to do it um we talked about them in terms of a lot and um people are talking about the idea of a pain wave or there are a lot of women running and it echoes Nineteen Ninety two which was also\nCalled the year and a woman so we're going to do a very quick game\nWhich is I read a quote and you're going to tell me if it's from Nineteen Ninety two the year of the woman is it for twenty eight candidates whatever the ... we are heard you you are yes um I mean you could get help from the crowd if it's a feeling I mean let\nThem try but if it feels like it's really not going to house okay [noise] um okay so let's start with Michelle\nAnd God healthy is old ban if they kick off these suburban women who've never really thought that their reproductive rights are at risk and all of a sudden there is that risk and Israel is that from Nineteen Ninety two or twenty Eighteen [noise]\nBut how the so no I'm going I'm going to guess Nineteen eighty two\nUm\nThat's like more optimistic
