Canada will choose the winner and as always if all goes well civil discourse\nWill also when so our motion is trigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous let's make the debaters here first the team arguing for the motion please welcome\nDavid Hudson junior [noise]\nDavid welcome to intelligence where'd you asked your professor of law at Vanderbilt your are the author co author co editor of more than forty bucks including let the students speak\nA history of the fight for free expression in American schools you're also First Amendment ombudsman for the Newseum Institute's First Amendment center that is a lot of First Amendment going on in your life so what sparked your interests first in free speech John\nIt was very personal I ordered a phrase and one of my high school classes a and was asked to leave got kicked out of class\n\nA reminder of what's going on we're halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared us debate on John Donne then we have for debaters two teams have to fighting it out over this motion trigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous you have heard the first to opening statements and now on to the third\nDebating for the motion trigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous here is David how soon junior First Amendment scholar and law professor at Vanderbilt University ladies and gentlemen David Hudson\nSafe spaces that protect students from offensive or disagreeable speech are anathema to the first amendment and the freedom of expression that we all hold sacrosanct\nSafe spaces infringe upon core fundamental First Amendment principles the first one is the so called marketplace of ideas it's traced back to justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in his descending opinion an Abrams versus United States in Nineteen Nineteen\nWhen he wrote we may not realize the fighting face they have come to believe that the ultimate good desire to better reach three free trade in ideas that the best test of thought is the freedom of thought to get itself accepted into the competition of the market\nAnd the United States Supreme court ... versus board of regents in Nineteen sixty seven proclaimed that the college classroom it's peculiar early the marketplace of ideas\nIf you have a safe space than you are preventing certain ideas from entering the market place the second principle is the counter speech doctrine and the counter speech doctrine essentially means that when we are confronted with harmful\nObnoxious and even repugnant speech our first response should not be to censor that speech but to counter it to show why it's wrong to come up with a better alternative\nThis theory is traced back to justice Louis Brandeis\nIn Whitney versus California Nineteen twenty seven erode if there'll be time to exposed to discussion befall sort of policy to avert the eagles by the processes of education the remedy to be applied is more speech not enforced sorry what's\nProblem was safe spaces is it leads to the silence scene in suppression of speech we don't want that we want more speech the first amendment protects a great deal of offensive obnoxious and even repugnant speech\nThe idea of shielding students from ideas contradicts that principle right we want to protect offensive and even disagreeable speech that's how we learn before fundamental First Amendment principle is that a lot of speeches in the eye of the beholder was offensive to some people may not be offensive to another person\nWas offensive to some people may not be offensive to another person that's why these safe spaces are dangerous\nSir Isaac Newton Copernicus\nGal while they were all ridiculed ostracized when they first issued some of their theories\nIf we had to face spaces would we shut all those great thinkers down we want speech to enter the marketplace of ideas and want to counter negative speech were positive speech we want to protect even offensive a noxious and repugnant speech\nBecause that's the essence of who we are\nAnd that's the essence of education [noise]\nLike very much say because of the motion again\nTrigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous our final speaker on the opening round who will be speaking against the motion Michael rough president of Wesleyan University ladies and gentlemen Michael rough [noise]\nThere are a lot of good ideas out here and I don't know if this is actually a marketplace or not but\nClearly they issue can be distorted so that it's easier to take a stand no one is really arguing that all students all the time said for protected against any disagreeable idea nobody has ever argue that it's never happened\nThe idea of safe spaces originated right after the second World War corporate America said you know one of the problems with the business world today is that people who work at my company are afraid to tell you the truth\nI'm the president or watching and I have to say what do you think how I'm doing at Wesleyan and people say oh you're doing fine sir and you don't call me surgical any president rough [noise]\nActually tell me the truth so after the second World War some good social psychologist mostly from central Europe came along and said well we need here is a safe space that's the words they use they said we need a safe space where employers can say you know president raw you've got your head in the wrong direction\nAnd they could do that without fear of retaliation or attack that was the definition of a safe space still works pretty well for me you can speak your mind without fear of retaliation or attacked when I was a student at Wesleyan in the seventies\nIt was pretty normal for professors to come to class and coach K she was pretty new wisely in those days they said well I'm a nerdy twenty eight year old I I Want to\nHave sex with someone who's Nineteen my students are available\nSo they use their powers of free expression to comment on students legs on their attire now he said I'm just exercising my professorial duties I care about that student\nWe space do students can learn\nSo they can tolerate disagreement when I was a young professor at a school where they are almost no African Americans one of my best students in African American woman she would routinely have professors ask her about the black experience and ... other students go up to her and say can I feel your hair\nMe any harm but she felt it was an on safe space\nNot because they were disagreeable I ... but because people weren't treating her as a person\nWhen I start my philosophy in film class I said to my students tonight you're going to watch a film about genocide it's horrible next week you're going to watch a film about murder police officers brutally gunned down in the wrong guy sent to jail documentary the third week\nWe're watching a film about child abuse\nAnd I tell them this if you can handle a genocide\nMurder trials have used in the first three weeks of the semester but if you can't handle it it's not the core see when I tell them to jokingly and if you really love this stuff\nGet help because I Want them to say oh it's going to be hard but actually we're in this together we're supporting each other it's safe enough to disagree and what may not be so painful to me might be very painful\nTo another kind a student who has a different kind of history so I urge you to vote against this motion that's safe spaces are dangerous thank you Michael rough\nAnd that's the first round one of the U.S debate where our motion is\nTrigger warnings safe spaces are dangerous now we move on to round to end in round two the debaters address one another directly and they also take questions for me and members of our live audience here and bounce Canada the team arguing for the motion Susan muscle and David Hudson\nAre telling us that protecting people from speeches anathema to the purpose of university they point out the laws are in place in terms of harassment\nThe team arguing against the motion us Bhagwati and Michael Ross make the point a safe spaces are nothing new it's not a wild concept\nThey've existed in business but they've also existed in the daily lives of all of us so those are the rough dividing lines between the two sides in a lot to unpack you're going to the side arguing for the motion that you've made the point strongly that we're talking about emotional harm not physical harm\nBut I think that I heard your opponents arguing that emotional harm is a real thing truly debilitating truly toxic and can be as disruptive to the safe learning environment\nDestructive to the process of learning almost as much as a punch in the nose that it can really ruined inability to exist didn't participate in the process of learning but it's a real thing emotional harm count so I don't want to take that one\nI read that emotional harm Israel but that's where I think our harassment and discrimination laws come in I additional evidence for some aren't necessary it beneficial but that's where the focus should lie I think this concept to save face\nFor all the reasons that we've delineated is so malleable I just don't think this concept health I mean we don't have to prove safe spaces are always dangerous if you think about what's classically dangerous in our society explosives firearms tornadoes there\nAlways dangerous but we know they can be dangerous and so therefore we classify them as dangerous and I think we've set a lot to show that this idea of safe spaces can be\nTo their ideas that an insult the examples that Michael refused of the book\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it in for Mike Rowe dot com\nDelineated is so malleable I just don't think this concept health I mean we don't have to\nProve safe spaces are always dangerous if you think about what's classically dangerous in our society explosives firearms tornadoes there always dangerous but we know they can be dangerous and so therefore we classify them as dangerous I think we've set a lot to show that this idea of safe spaces can be\nDangerous to their ideas that an insult to the examples that Michael refused to the black a woman in his class of people wanting to touch her hair made her feel he used doors literally unsafe do you not credit that students experience of feeling unsafe\nYeah I think the word safety I might correlate it it definitely did notes this question of physical safety and I think ... and confusing that that line between being upset being offended affronted and being actually unsafe is on help I Do think it contributes to carry\n\nDishes intelligence squared us I'm John Donvan\nWho makes a civil statement and tries to further debate but one student in the classes in some way emotionally upset in that case the student could be sanctioned because the classroom itself at the university is a safe space absolutely\nNot I mean I run a classroom everyday people disagree all the time that's part of the discourse that's part of the norm no one is suggesting that\nThere's this question of degree right and a lot of it seems to me the argument against safe spaces is an argument that well if you go a little bit over the line then you can't express any ideas that anyone disagrees with\nNo with serious ... it's about what the line it's an everyday classroom teachers have to figure out the example from Chicago would that over the line right muttering about affirmative action simply when an African American students tries to speak that's not such a court that should be stopped that has to be stuff that I Would say I want to move on to some more questions\nAh my name is Tracy and my question is do you believe that can says currently site inundated by aggressive in critical opinions that they are largely unsafe faces right\nAnd is should we not maintaining our attention to ... and why students have sons I\nAsked would you like to take that one of the reasons why ice so strongly do believe in safe spaces is because I think it is impossible to make the entire campus entirely safe because a large censorship machine at that level is risky and very difficult to operate I mean I I wouldn't want to be in charge of it\nSo why don't we need to work on that that is more about teaching\nIt is more than ... silencing we need to learn to teach students who are saying things which frankly are offending other students\nWhy those other students might find it offensive and why that might be reasonable now some students are going to go and do it anyway right but I think most people are decent people most people don't want to hurt other people's feelings I'm a believer rather and the educated a function of the University of rather and the silencing function but yes it's a problem\nDavid if college and university campuses have a multitude of ideas that's a great thing to be celebrated its not to be feared\nWe want people with different arguments to come forth with their viewpoints that's the beauty of a college and university campus I mean think about when you went to college the divisive topics right abortion affirmative action capital punishment\nImmigration reform gun control if you've always kept the same view on all those issues then yeah let's go have some safe space coddled be thrown in a cocoon and live in an echo chamber that's not where we want in a free society\nWe want [noise] [noise]\nOkay another question the far side they're supposed to be on my name is ... she'll come as you can probably hear from my accent from a country without the first amendment without even the constitution the first place but we nonetheless treasure free speech can you can find a ... he's a safe space and do people have rights notes to this\nWell let me let me I Want to take of just the last question because I think we have been kicking around the idea of what is the safe space and perhaps it's going to be unresolved the right not to listen you've been accused of actually arguing for that David\nIn the first amendment community we often talk about simply the first Amendment rights of the speaker but they're also First Amendment rights of the listener and it's the right to receive information ideas and was shut down the ideas when we damp and discourse we're infringing on the right to receive information ideas as well\nDavid answer your question is of course you have a right not to listen in public I may have to put up with it but in spaces where I Want to be left alone and can be left alone of course I have a right not to listen and in some sense comes to my door and knock said test I'm going to give you a twenty minute lecture on white supremacy\nI'm going to close that door ID I don't want to hear right which is not to say that person does not have the first amendment right to participate in public discourse in public places but I don't have to listen to him even when they're speaking in a park I don't stop and listen\nBut that's fundamentally different than a safe space that shuts off ideas and the first place and yes you do have a right not to listen Justice John Marshall hauling referred to it directly in ... California when he said avert your eyes\nBut that's in public places that was from the LA county courthouse where a lot of college and university campuses are public first I'm saying the college campuses can be segmented right I'm not suggesting that the square in a college campus can be converted to pay\nCash St black house or a student immigration activists there can be a diversity of ideas there there could be criticism there that can be deep disputes over tactics methods priorities you know it it can get contentious but that doesn't mean ideas are excluded arguments or ... minutes we're\nSaying is that if you can have an African American house you can have a hill out on campus the fact that you go there to talk to people who share some of your ideas doesn't mean that all ideas are excluded there that there is no freedom\nAs you're not ... of the danger of retaliation or a towel and that can happen even in these closed\nBound retell a disagreement is not the same as retaliation and an attack you have disagreement and you have the exchange of ideas but you do so within a border\nAnd that is different in classrooms than it is in the ... it's different in the chapel it's different Sunday Morning than it is when the Chappelle is used for something else and the idea that you couldn't segment the campus into some stations that are safe for some students some of the time at that seems an odd I okay I'd like to go okay I'd like to surf\nThe most compelling argument that I heard for\nThe for side is the side from the against side which is how Mike Rounds has classroom which is to say well we're talking about is the failure of leadership professors who are unable or unwilling to create that context and draw the red lines and say you're going to listen if you don't want to listen you have to leave because we're in the classroom\nI okay let's I understand that must be good I think we would all agree I think that it would be preferable if in classroom experience for professors to create an environment for robust exchange of ideas but where everyone felt included\nSponsorship of the kick you read the live stream bite Hooper micro of Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it in for Mike Rowe dot com\nWhile we're talking about is a failure of leadership professors who are unable or unwilling to create the context and draw the red lines and so you're going to listen if you don't want to listen you have to leave because we're in the classroom\nI okay let's I understand I was ... I think we would all agree I think\nThat it would be preferable if in classroom experience for professors to create an environment for a robust exchange of ideas\nBut where everyone felt included that they were full members of that discussion and that that much better handled by the teacher herself or himself and it is by a a dean or even a prison okay let's go to another question\nThank you um the world is not a safe space and we survive by learning to make our own safe spaces so if we as young people have universities creating safe spaces for us how will we ever learn to carve out our own safe space in the world was close to us but it was [noise]\n\n[noise] I I think the answer is simple that's the problem is you have a hope you can retreat to\nThe students do not because they're surrounded by the university at all times at the university says no you're out of luck what are you going to do it's a special circumstance campuses ... strange creatures because they are mixture of many many many different things and to treat them as a whole as if they're sort of generic I think is wrong\nUniversity in my view has\nAbsolute right to help students create safe spaces of the sorts of when they're adults off campus enough control over their lives more people do for themselves but at the Capitol university should not make the entire campus a safe space notice talking about the perfect idea response we have a son\nI mean I think that's it it's a bit of a company's argument because if it's their home twenty four seven and they needed safety to be able to inhabit\nThat home inevitably that brings up the role of the institution in generating that safety which I think you agree with so it's not just a matter of what happens when the four of us gather in a room together or club meets it's really a larger question of what happens on campus I think this term\nSafety with a smelly ability and nebulous nests one person's safety being dangerous for another person the kinds of criticisms and attacks\nAnd perhaps undermining of emotional safety that can happen even at a closed space just makes this term very problematic and it leads to what you're talking about which is a sense on the part of the institution that they need to step in that students can't navigate this for themselves that they have\nTo come in and inevitably you know they're coming in to suppress speech at the end the start of safety is being pitted against speech and it opens the door to censorship so that's why this\nTerm can be dangerous we don't have to prove it it's inherently dangerous we just have to prove that it can be dangerous\nMicro yeah lots of things that can be dangerous that is true I I Do think we have to remember that these students\nAre well aware that when they graduate they'll have to make their own space is they're well aware of that in the United states today that they will be entering in a world where there'll be much less likely to interact with people who don't share their views there'll be answering the world is much more intense of inequality", "show_name": "It's Your World", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
