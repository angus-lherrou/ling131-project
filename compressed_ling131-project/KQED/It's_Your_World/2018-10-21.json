A. fund dot org and the corporation for public broadcasting [noise]\nSo [noise] ooh\nThis is hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam we start today with an account of two communities one is liberal the other conservative\nI Want you to gas which is where [noise]\nThe schools with stress [noise] patriotism man respect [noise] it would be a very rural face a educational system\nHow is this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully green and mowed the town of the class with lots of churches that town one\nHears town to the schools would be based more on stereotypes are all kinds of things rather than\nThan real memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters in foreign films are more of those in churches that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embrace ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to that so how did these two towns which our guest today refers to as liberal and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward\nExplanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as the basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national\nSecurity but what if I told you there's something deeper into those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listened to the food we eat the politicians we ...\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [laughter]\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon articles with me about how science proves that the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter let's say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological difference is between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nI remember one of the things that broke the Internet recently was the big controversy about whether people heard\nThe word Laura or heard the word ... but this idea that you know the way that we see here's something must be the way everyone else sees that and there's just this feeling of other disbelief that other people might not see and hear the world the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I Do think that's something we need to continue the pound away on that that we really are wired up quite differently\nLet's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here is Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nWe are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream like shoot down here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these our politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think you know immigration defense or police law and order but I think that's what's really at the core of of who we are and have a quarter of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us and it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place for\nAll\nNow there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the ... of a political considerations that are difficult to disentangle\nFrom psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings John one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently\nPicture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or\nIn one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative\nThat is true I never been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did a goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we have the most luck with a pictures of mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about them all of a good look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly\nAccurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory too and that's part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I kicked him in the ... century would be active\nBut also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody stepping on a rocky now goes right through there but you're still matter sensory too it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation in Madison answer to that conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents like my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans if you fall into a group of fraternal an identical twins\nEach twin Paris raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as it grew\nAt fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is the driver I asked John ... studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data that a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda needs\nA long ago it's fairly dated data set\nA but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views\nAnd when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a find that there the political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes misread this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but you know that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all uh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but\nYou know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero\nBut apparently that was enough that at some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer laying in the political orientation of identical twins then into political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see the you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have which fresh inside\nA ... and you've made the case that in many ways the more we were able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked to me about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like ... you know we used to think that uh if you're a left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever you wrote with his left hand train them to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left handed it very biological this was something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people uh realize that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that\nSo we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather what oriented to the world\nSimply being a lazy but rather were oriented to the world and a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them that this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions what\nWould you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because we didn't always have\nThis deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when\nWe had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was off into the leftist more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years\n[noise] what I Would say to\nThat argument is that I Believe we have always had this very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats and think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise]\nUm [noise] Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great ... I'm Sorry I Can't give it to you ever paid them but it's basically the ah the division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people were supportive of the innovation is very old and a structured the world since time began\n[noise]\nJohn hitting is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln here spent years studying the psychological and you're a logical differences between liberals and conservatives along with Kevin Smith and John Alford he's the co author of the book predispose liberals\nIn a fence the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue\nAt that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president of the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that\nOf the democracy so now the conflict just defense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be an a credible source of weakness\nIn the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers but yeah I mean at that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right but I Want to have these concede the possibility that maybe there are others who have something of value all\nIf maybe that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong\nThere's this fence that if you believe in democracy so much\nThere's only so far you're willing to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family writes a family we have every family people by the world they disagree about all sorts of things but if there is love and the family the conflict only goes so far the love breakdown than actually the conflict convinced the family part\n[noise]\nAnd the twentieth century the bonds of democracy what tested again when we come back the political upheavals are the Nineteen sixties and there are echoes today [noise] stay with us [noise]\nYou're listening to hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam [noise]\nThis is NPR\nAnd this is ... public radio coming up at three AM radio lab face off on Facebook\nTriggered hornets now in the next radiolab now that over two billion people are posting things on Facebook who decides what we can see and what we can [noise]\nRadiolab at three AM freakonomics radio is that for him this morning I'm Steve end up there on the next freakonomics radio we explore a phenomenon so scary some people won't even say it loud [noise]\nWe're not those people that choke is an amazing thing because it really does destroy careers\nWhen we choke why we chose and maybe just maybe not to\nThe next time and freakonomics radio freakonomics radio at four and then if we can edition five\nStay with us here on ... public radio\nAnd that's how you can get good morning we have a sunny Sunday in stores temperatures sixties mid eighties\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the corporation for public broadcasting and the state of Joan crock this request serves as an enduring investment in the future of public radio\nFrom the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise\nAlong with a legacy of putting clients financial well being first learn more it Raymond James dot com and from the John ...
