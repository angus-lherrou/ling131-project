time two o'clock\n\nWelcome to world affairs the weekly broadcast of the world affairs counsel I'm Jane ... the email this is the third and a three part series focused on climate change that has consequences and it's also about the reasons we have for help\nI admit I Am among those who sometimes despair of\nOur inability to muster the political will to address climate change but there are hopeful signs and our guest former vice president Al Gore would speak to some of them he argues that we're now in the early stages of sustainability revolution\nCan present his point of view and a conversation with economists large Tyson professor at UC Berkeley yes Iran was recorded the coal and I aren't light on climate solutions symposium in San Francisco sponsored by the Asian society [noise]\nStay tuned for the second half of our program when we'll hear from two grassroots leaders\nSecond half of our program we moved here from two grassroots leaders site to address climate change this broadcast news made possible each week for a generous support the family and the dream for me to counseling nation I Want to start\nWith a quota ... particularly like\nWhere I Am a stay in the middle of the revolution or a kid I mean do you feel that in relation to transform\nIt and and went to the digital camera yeah so we optimistic\nAn optimist about what's happening\nWhat are the main reason to\nI'm watching a trend thing when you look at it now\nAnd understanding already [laughter]\nYeah well first anybody who deals with the climate crisis in so many of you here have been dealing with it for quite a while\nAbout any of us who get involved or occasionally have a struggle between hope and despair I Will admit that openly off but I always do come down on the side of hope and I think the evidence or justifying that whole foods is overwhelming now\nThe sustainability for evolution magnitude of industrial speed of the digital\nIs based on a many of the new digital tools that are now available\nOr with machine learning and artificial intelligence the Internet of things so precision a machining or a confrontational science and digital science or in many different varieties I'll give you one quick example from the bay area [noise]\nUm [noise] two guys from London them is a civil sudden stop us away money to started a deep mine which many including many regard as the\nBest artificial intelligence to the company in the world um and after they were bought by alphabet slash school\nA few years passed and Google asked them to examine the energy use in their server farms the biggest server farms have vending company on the world and without any new hardware bud just with the application of artificial intelligence to\nIt must be at a highly structured data that had been collected painstakingly over a long period of time uh since they were able to\nReduce the energy use by fifty six percent increase out sort of process information know hardware changes just\nA more intelligent management of the electrons and beat to use a centrally uh and and there are tens of thousands of use cases where this can be of law at and so it is beginning to be applied elsewhere [noise] I'll let them tell their story about the other examples that are non public yet\nBut basically many executive teams are now acquiring the ability to manage um electrons Adams molecules\nWith the same precision the IT companies have used in managing bits of information we've seen demand destruction in energy use began to accelerate\n'cause they look at the same same or eleven so I think it's going to be around here ah this week uh ... uh I've always learned a lot from a memory of if I can absorb it as fast [laughter] out\nUm but but um [noise] um he he gives so many examples of the same exact thing or a happening with the um\nThe the management of energy demand a and of course we another cause for optimism is that the same a radical a cost reduction\nCurves that we many of us first became aware of it with Moore's law on comparative ships\nNow were sequencing is coming down to eight times faster than Moore's law a ... and there are lots and lots of these cost reduction curves that reflect the sustainability revolution a ... and ... and what we're seeing\nHow I get is hyper efficiency new business models\nThe kind of disruption that came with the digital revolution and we're now seeing in the physical world\nI think you also talk about the extent to which everything that the pace of technological change which they can stay in the digital world has been faster and then expect and even if you look and things like what's happened in the solar energy space and entered the what happened to the type of solar what's happened in the ...\nAnd when that faster than people expect and those type shift has a current event is is that part\nYeah totally 'cause these cost reduction curves are perhaps most visible\nAh with renewable energy Eighteen years ago the best projections\nFor wind energy word that the world would be able to install thirty gigawatts by twenty ten we've now beaten that a goal by Eighteen times over\nA sixteen years ago the best projections were on solar that the world would be able to install a one gigawatt per year by twenty ten ... ten arrived they'd be that goal by Seventeen times over last year they beat at Ninety eight times over\nAnd to this this exponential curve is still a getting deeper and deeper and moving up faster and faster the number of\nPV cells installed\nA the cost has been coming down dramatically are already here in the United states there are five times\nAs many jobs in solar has in coal or the ... the single ... according to the bureau of Labor Statistics the single fastest growing job in America or his solar installer it's growing nine times [laughter] Astor than than average job growth\nSecond fastest growing jobs is so when turban technicians here are the famous um\nA coal museum in Kentucky or just install solar panels on the truth\n[laughter] call and I put out a press\nRelease [laughter] short American market\nGot a little bit in the morning and then of course they're going to have a main delegation of people from around the world during the Columbus combat markets and the ability to leap frog went about fat as a source of\nOptimism or are you concerned that access to take a country like in math and population growth not for me to tell about\nThe electricity a delivery system will be ... for not correct about that ... emerging markets and the optimism that he might have for trying to me\nYeah well the analogy that I have often used I think it is a\nA way of understanding how this works and that is to cell phones\nAre in Nineteen eighty I'm a TNT asked McKinsey estimates\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature ban political science and in post ... will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot ... dot edu\nHim in in the first three days of the year\nBefore he hears a whole hundred twenty times ... says [laughter] and and and there were three reasons why they were way wrong way or the cost came down much faster\nThan anyone expected even as the the technology improved dramatically there'll be another round of improvements I have read in the press release that apple has another announcement tomorrow\nOr what's the third reason for this huge explosion in the use of mobile phones is that the ... the majority of the people in the world lived in areas that had no land line telephones grits so they leap frog\nAnd now you have places in East Africa for example that make much\nOr more intense the views of banking by phone and all kinds of services of by phone company ... has sold five hundred thousand or a D.C a solar powered television sets out in villages that have no electricity coverage\nThat\nI guess we're going to like ... over and ... that's\nGoing on hiring based because they're still playing youngest activity\nYeah yeah or if you look at it on a global basis\nOr taxpayers around the world are being required to subsidize the burning of fossil fuels\nAt a rate thirty eight times\nGreater than the meager subsidies for renewable energy\nIn the U.S too it's not as bad as that I think it's twenty four on okay as much and and this was of course manifestly of absurd ... and ...\nIf you if you look at what we're we're treating the atmosphere is an open sewers where half an hour and says as most people realize the atmosphere\nThis guy's not a vast and limitless expand system extremely narrow shell surrounding the planet and we're putting a hundred and ten million tons of manmade heat trapping gas\nInto that shell\nAs if it's an open ... or do we tell people oh you have the millions of tons of of ah the toxic gaseous ways to harm broke out yesterday as waste just dump it in the sky we don't care or you know charge about ... you know we'll both dumped out on\nThe environmental expert analysis and future generations so yes that ought to be included in the metrics by ... is that we use to measure\nThe value of decisions of the choices that we May of course so\nWe are in fact I got to try and they're not it's not really sure\nSame boat chest I think so important why we need to stay a little bit about\nSoon as they can you know\nThere are a hurricane and they're having hurricane pictures here when hurricane flying have to find a\nOkay uh well first of all the before you even get to the hurricanes have there been any fires in California this year\nAre you know the Mendocino Complex fire was the largest fire in the history of California are that fire tornado or at wars of half a mile across at the base and a one thousand four hundred degrees hundred and sixty mile hundred and forty mile an hour winds\nAnd every year the record is broken here and now the drought and the four corners region I mean I could go through the list but let's just talk for a second about Hurricane Florence says on the way it is crossing a part of the Atlantic ocean where the temperature of the water is three and a half\nDegrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal\nSo it has intensified at a record or near record rate it's up to a cat for I think it's going to get into a category five\nOr ... and so\nThe number of hurricanes are so iconic storms hurricanes typhoons ... around there all the same thing they have different names that notion ... or ... the absolute number doesn't increase but the number of the big ones increases dramatically\nAnd one reason is as the water is warmer that convection energy drives the\nWind speeds or to to much higher levels\nAnd the warming now goes down in the ocean Ninety percent of the heat we're trapping everyday kind of going into the oceans and it's now penetrating deeper than two thousand meters so hurricanes as they approached the land instead of turning up the cold water or insurance or cutting the conviction energy\nWhen the water is hot all the way to the bottom then they just keep on building in strength so that's that's one thing I can see level was already higher so the storm surges greater and here's the other factor that you\nWill see play out on the news if the if the projections by the meteorologists are are correct\nThey normally the northern hemisphere jetstream moves weather systems across the north American continent but as we saw with hurricane\nAcross the north American continent but as we saw with Hurricane Harvey last year and a Houston, Texas all the jet stream has been getting much wave here and episodic leave this organizing\nAnd so we get these periods where weather systems just are locked in place for multiple days in a row of last year and in Harris County Texas Harvey which came around much warmer water\nIt stayed there for five days and if you think in your mind about Niagara Falls and how the giant they are\nFive hundred and nine days worth of the full flow of Niagara Falls ... was dumped him five days on Texas and Louisiana\nAnd in Harris County though it got up it was the five feet of rain\nAnd they're talking now thirty inches or they are predicted for pork solve the Carolinas because again if you look on the news every night on the TV news I say this off and there's like a nature I through the book of revelation a ... and [noise]\nAnd you know often the news media doesn't connect the dots what people are saying whoa this is unusual or ... and they're now predicting that this Hurricane Florence is not only going to be a massive hurricane\nAnd drop and an enormous amount of rain but it but it's going to stay there for days at a time and the south eastern quadrant extending over the ocean as Hurricane Harvey did last year\n... continues to replenish the moisture in the storm we got five percent more humidity in the in the atmosphere of the earth today than in Nineteen eighty\nLook cause we're we're disrupting the water cycle that's one of the bases of life by dramatically increasing the amount of water vapor coming off the ocean\nEnd of the sky so we get these rain bombs\nOr like the one after the fire or a ... in Santa Barbara environment here at if I got a rain bombs and that that\nLed to the ... so they're ... multiple factors are are underway at the same time and we've only mentioned a few of them\nBut look at some point we have got to collectively say uh we can go on like this\nThe scientist predicted\nYears ago what Hurricane Florence looks the phenomena that Hurricane Florence is good that the fact that the scientists were right on almost everything they predicted about the climate crisis decades ago\nShould cause us to pay a little more attention to what they're saying will happen in the future if we don't get our arms around this\nAnd start in the ... the global economy at a very rapid rate and bracing this sustainability revolution and creating a world that we can say to our kids and grandkids\nAnd this is the best we can do we did not close our eyes and we did not turn away we are all the way we are all live we're paying attention we're going to do the right thing [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nAnd I mentioned that he'd have had two major ways in many ways you can express your activism wanted to end up the nonprofit and we just talked about which is very influential around the world and to really are starting out and running and it's a very successful for for profit standing Melanie investment\nOperations I Will be discussing the importance of good private capital on and so not only\nThat more and more investors really care about using their investment dollars and you're in contact your\nYour pension fund or ... you know who who's managing your four o one K ... the the amount of money that's allocated in decisions in the private sector\nIs they've asked multiple of all the money allocated in in government budget governments have to play the leading role and I'll say that again we bought\nThe private sector and particularly the un's vestments sector\nOr a can play a crucial role in navigating this this shift toward sustainability absolutely so everybody can be involved you know in their personal lives and in their economic lives down in their political wash and he will share\nThat basically a\nLarge percentage of and after about three quarters uh X. ray cock about staying ... one of their ... and ...\nAnd I'm not allowed to hire\nMore than ... percent [laughter] so so it's really in Portland chair now that the active as that you demonstrated in both parts of the political mobilization making phone calls training people to go out and doing crafts for an organization is awesome being max by\nA flow of interest and dollars from private investors and thank you for making that both of those things ... of all\nThat kind of [noise]\nThank you [noise]\n\n\nWhich in turn from former vice president Al Gore he was in conversation with the economist learn to type ... he's he Berkeley after the break my co host ray Suarez will sit down with two grassroots leaders discuss strategy used and lessons learned what they call it was just playing to their lifetimes\nAnd that's what we see all over the world and we see it in this country as well that within the United states low income communities communities of color are the ones\nNext to the coal projects the fracking wells pipelines and are the ones who are on the front lines of impacts and so this is a story about\nClimate change impacting the poor impacting people who have very little with which to respond\nHaving said that there is a tremendous amount of organizing and resilience in these very same communities this is a story about people rising up and doing everything that they can but the risks are very big\nBut a young person listening to this program ... let's say twenty eight twenty nine years might say look\nI'm not a shareholder I'm not a company director what how what influence there was a young person really have\nWell I can think of three things right off the bat that young people arguing and can do and you know I'm not making these up I'm watching it happened in the form I very eyes the first is young people as participants in our democracy and and democracy is all over the world\nWho vote about climate change who see this as an issue fundamentally about their future and they see it connected to other issues they care about about justice and about economic justice as well\nAnother thing young people can do is they mobilize and we see this over and over again I remember the first time I went to a United Nations climate conference I was still young enough to be in the youth delegation when we were T shirts that said how old will you be in twenty fifty\nAnd the idea was to convey that the people in negotiating we're not going to see the worst effects of climate change and we were trying to point out do this for the next generation do this for your children and your grandchildren now of course that's changed we're seeing these impacts in our lifetime\nBut that was an incredibly powerful action that pushes decision makers to take more political courage\nAnd the third thing I Would say is communication and storytelling and young people are right now the masters of social media a lot of the stories that are dominating um news cycles young people are helping consume that media and shape the stories and\nThat is another way that young people are not taking this crisis sitting down but this this is not this dynamic of giving up what can I Do this is so serious\nWe seen this in social movements throughout history and if people give up if people gave up over struggles for civil rights for suffrage\nFor the right to vote the right to\nLive in a non segregated society where would we be today so I think it's it's a similar situation with young people and the climate crisis\nThat they see their risks they're motivated and when I talk to young people I always start by saying\nI Would be incredibly frustrated if I were getting involved in this movement right now and my hat is off to you for your commitment given the political challenges we face\nNone of the urban urine Indonesian island of very ... of chain of islands were very large population thousands of those islands are small enough to actually be threatened with being inundated do Indonesians\nDo people in the Malaysia ah do people facing\nThis actually think you know the things I Do can make a difference to what happens downstream\nEven though now I live in the United states but I keep my a connection to my sisters and brothers in Indonesia\nAnd um this is our uh issue but climate change is a global issue but uh we are impacted locally\nAnd I think as Indian nations we see ourselves as a very a quiz show up a ticking crucial role as well as a strategic\nSo last year we started to\nHave this campaign on Frank to pilot a thousand mosques using solar energy so not just the moms for example talking about protecting the U.S in the mosque from the book that but also people and community started to see\nThat it's a solar panel in my ... and then they take a price on it and then we can use that as a mode of education or two people and I think like\nEach individual king can a take on their own uh actions are a lot of people are told me that oh I'm just a one percent I cannot make a difference but I said flip it on another way even a small steps that you do\nA little we'll keep lie that into ... million ten million a hundred million\nAnd if you see that it's like you know if like millions of people doing the same thing like you is that it's going to make a difference and people start to say yes that is you know like that it's a scale so\nThat's the spirit that we want to bring two people that they're not just one person that we are on this boat together and we will work together to make a difference and we're supporting each other so uh I think I'm very hopeful I think like because I'm from\nUh the faith communities hope is the the thing that the fate can offer\nTo all of this devastation that we are facing at this\nTime I think one of the toughest parts of this conversation is to imagine what equity looks work\nNon us from a part of the world with tremendous aspirations they want to live the way they see people in a imported movies and TV shows living they want the good things are when you open up the door of an apartment or a house to have the things that they see\nOr other people in the world having and then they find old now now are we going to have to have a simplicity movement before you guys get rich we got rich by getting the dirty for a century\nBut now now that we're already rich we're going to say okay now it's time for simplicity that's a tough sell to the young people of the rest of the world isn't\nIt you're exactly right and here I'd like to point out that that aspect one of the worst of impacts of Trump pulling the U.S out of the Paris Agreement is our commitment to the green climate fund and a commitment to actually support the transition\nCommitment to the green climate fund and a commitment to actually support the transition off of fossil fuels and supporting adaptation to climate change for countries in the global south so\nThat's just one example of many\nWhere we see these inequities play out and I agree with you visualizing what this looks like\nRequires a lot of imagination and I think the people doing most of that imagination are the frontline communities are the people who are trying to figure out what is adjust transition actually if we recognize the severity of climate change\nWhat does that mean in our community what does that mean for the kind of jobs that are created\nWhat does that mean for people who currently don't have a job and the only job available is building a pipeline\nAnd trying to visualize that there is examples right here in the bay area in Richmond, California of people trying to live into this equitable future\nNone of them and how do you talk about these things to the the millions of you in Cairo in Kuala Lumpur in Jakarta\nIn the southern islands of the Philippines how do you say well now that the world has been filled up with carbon\nBy France and Britain and Russia and the United states now we're going to come to your parts of the world\nUnder threat and say look or you're just not going to be able to live in the wasteful dirty way that people lived fifty years ago or six years ago while they were getting rich\nClimate change is not just\nAn economic issue or political issue or even scientific issue but it's also like\nA moral and ethical crisis we need to put that on the table first that uh we hear that climate change is moral issue or ethical issue so that we would they use in the global south or in the developing world that\nBe being bombarded every day with the chairs and you know like all this films like a like try to lift like they're\nThey're ... years in an order or develop worlds then we need to really sit together like all these you it's like I almost have this idea is that\nThat we can have built this a solidarity together that\nWe want the future or to look different not like what the you know like the former generation has been developing this world before but when you want as younger generation to create our own future that we want like may sat", "show_name": "It's Your World", "year": "2018",
