responsible drinking and from the any Casey foundation\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in Russia Today ideas about who we are what makes us us and we've been talking about ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine\nCould make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like superheroes right like perfectly Asian superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I Know that I think that's that's the science fiction association of what CRISPR could allow\nMe to have long lists\nOf gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with\nThings that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that that technology is promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to pan or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world is HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you nailed delivered it into a fertilized egg so into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIt's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever need\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many of the far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity\nAre many debt for right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the richest HIV immunity genes your five ... prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene during that exist naturally but only one to two percentage humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what you might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders should we be doing that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and make that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course but we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years that we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children ... and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think\nYou have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it in embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nWere being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise]\nHamstrung Barry is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the I think of all power to control evolution you can check out his head talk at ... dot com\n\nToday show we're asking a very important question which is\nWho are we okay by the way you have the answer do you know who we are\nUh I Know who I Am [laughter] I'm Sorry I ever\nHad an inkling of who we are this is Steven Pinker by a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\nSo ... what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipped says with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just sad and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with us [laughter] okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether\nWho we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand kids in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from me historian you guys [laughter] man has no instinct and the anthropologist actually lock and gave the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nA scientist and things and go without ... why shouldn't have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found in genial foremost I guess more blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the plane than some people can have more than others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and any quality and other\nPolitical sphere of human nature or if we weren't blind way we can affect mankind angel dream of profitability of our citizens through social engineering whereas if we're born with surfing [laughter] half of them like some damage to help us miss prejudice and violent [noise]\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to get out of the human mind as a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that can come into the world where certain temperament and talented doesn't all come from the outside oh and anyone who\nHas a child and a house that I certainly noticed that child exposed things from acquiring a human language where house had flown presumably because of some difference between them and\nAnyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationships knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not in Russia [noise]\nSo for years that debate about nature versus nurture has been\nJeff Bass a debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this\nBe a debate that who we are\nThis shouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment\nA cooling trend though will start on Tuesday within onshore flow as it returns that cooler weather\nPower comes from the University of Florida we're solving for now is powered by its land grant heritage from renewable energy to global

something that isn't conscious very [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially it's a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing\nWe exist [noise] and I'll ... explains more from the stage\nLast spring this question is so important because consciousness to each of us is all areas without that as well\nAs myself as nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's through mental illness or pen and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other
