have certainly wouldn't have electric scooters\nThat's making roads Dickey senior reporter with tech crunch numbers business model famously caught officials in many cities off guard\nThe newer mobility companies are facing stricter requirements to deploy\nAround the country regulators are quickly coming up to speed on oh yeah we kind of control the streets we can ask for a things that\nMeet our equity in climate and other goals Stuart Cohen is executive director of transformed the transit advocate for he joined ... and ... along with Megan rose ... store at a recent climate one event to discuss the new urban mobility [noise] son Jay let's\nBegin with you or seven years ago you started boosted bores what was your inspiration your goals starting a ...\nCompany [noise] yeah it was an odd choice because I'd never skateboard before\nBut we were a group of us were in graduate school at Stanford Stanford has a very spread out campus in Palo Alto as a city is a little bit far from campus for walking and so the boosted board was kind of a a fun\nThing we built for ourselves to be able to get around the campus and cover these short trips in between buildings are parking lots or being able to take it onto the Caltrans system that the the transit system in the bay area um and be able to cover the short distances\nAnd what we found was that people liked it because it was interesting and cool but then after they started to use it they said well I was actually changed the way that I get around my city\nSo it started you know the classic story of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur you know ... or solving a problem in their life and starting a company to it to a to address that are making rose Dickey where is this happening to give us a sense of the geographic scope of the scooters bikes that are popping up yeah\nI mean it's worldwide especially with bike share we see effects Sherry and I'm In China like it that's where it really kind of took off and then\nWith with these electric scooters receiving them all across the nation and San Francisco and Austin, Texas\nAnd Santa Monica California and Venice, California Washington DC I'm either so I'm In North Carolina there they're kind of just popping up all over the the state and and even line for example they have some scooter is over in Switzerland\nAnd the rollout how these things have appeared has had a big impact and how they've been received by by citizens so Megan tell us how they rolled out in San Francisco and how that compares to the rollout and other cities because there's been quite a difference in the way they kind of showing up [laughter]\nYeah it wasn't great the way that they hold out in San Francisco and a lot of city regulators were pretty upset with I whispered line and spin and said they just deployed on the streets and the next thing you know\nFewer people using helmets then we'll be but I think it's important that access to those helmets so that if someone wants to be safe or they have the opportunity to do so\nI still recovering a you know is this a case of you know nanny government should government regularly safety in this place or should have kind of like provide a safe place don't regulate helmets\nWell I I think government should push safety but I Do think the main danger out there continues to be vehicles and vehicle collisions\nI'm with people and so um I I think some days right that when we hear about all these people complaining about it being on the sidewalk\nLet's take that energy and create more space on our streets for shared vehicles and for these sustainable modes of of bikes and scooters I think the scooters you know you have to go pretty slow on a sidewalk even if you are weaving between people\nI'm ... so to me it's really a call with all of these new options to get more separated infrastructure for bikes\nFor scooters for things uh and and I think you're right like with like chair it's going to go ahead with encouragement for helmets but I I just don't see us getting to a hundred percent helmet use on these\nRove\nGirl listening to a climate one conversation about new ways of getting around town coming I wrecked often how about the greenhouse gas impact of these new meal [noise] and how to get more people\nUsing them to encourage these more simple motor we need to really rethink how transportation happen and if you're

[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... talking about the new urban mobility Megan rose ... a senior reporter was that crunch Stewart towing executive director of transform\nAnd send you a story you know skip scooter here's your husband Greg don't really thinking why our ...\nLift getting into this they you know what's in it\nFor their greedy and they want everything [laughter] but really I mean that's that they\nI mean ... new ... shot he has said that they're very wants to become the multinational transportation platform\nMeaning if you open that perhaps they want to have ... they want to have ... and they want to have electric scooter is they want to have aerial taxis like they want it they blow their effect transistor delivered jeez I'm\nAnd those ... are looking into the\nElectric scooters as well as bike sharing and yeah like I said they just wanna they wanna own transportation\nSo that you whether it's a one mile saying or a five mile thing airport run or a hop downtown they want they ... are left to be the place you go to do that I'm Stuart Cohen what do we know about ... and left in terms of what they're taking people out of you know to get into their cars are they coming out a transit what are they coming from\nYeah well there's been a growing number of studies ah but I think one of the best ones came out to UC Davis recently where they were actually able to really interview folks in seven no largest cities and a sound that a good number of the trips they put it at forty nine to sixty one percent\nWere coming out of either walking biking transit a or a trip that wouldn't have been made it all about twenty percent of those ones have been made at all ah ends and so the other portion then are replacing a you know drive alone or or a car pool trips and so they also said that\nYou know there's some amount of debt heading its range between twenty to fifty percent that's when they're driving looking for somebody so kind of putting on miles\nAnd so uh that report said that you can't really nailed down how much extra a miles of travel are happening but that direction only ah we're pretty sure that they're increasing the number of miles being driven on roads\nWhat we need to do to change that is that right now you pull up your app and it's just so convenient both lifted newberger just go with that single ride a I Know lift at least has started to\nChange their app so that it will encourage shared rights including just showing you how much less expensive it is and kind of giving you a guaranteed time um and then they would be putting on\nYou know bike share scooter on to that and so so the benefit in some ways of having a lift and Newburgh get into this is that\nYou get to see less expensive more sustainable a modes stacked up against a what's currently something that might be increasing the amount of driving this takes place\nSo that gets to the greenhouse gas impact without somebody is what we were concerned about here at climate one\nYou know we know that we bring leftover increasing the number ... congestion cars on the road\nAnd so are you saying Stuart Cohen that having scooters versus well is that one mile you know I can hop on a scooter and and go there for a dollar and maybe they'll show me the greenhouse impacted the carbon emissions or take a car and it'll ... is is that we're going\nI think it is a large number of those trips are under three miles and that's where the bike share and scooters can really come into play and so if a you know one of the lift uber trips is seven dollars in that range you know six to seven dollars and\nUh the bikes or you know one to two that's a very big price difference\nAnd uh you know the speed might not be all that different as well or and so uh especially in downtown it of course might be my faster the ultimate things really um also showing how far it would take to walk 'cause a lot it fits our one to two miles and you know by the time you wait by the time to sit at the lights\nYou could do that walk and twenty five minutes and and that's the most sustainable way to go but to encourage that to encourage these more simple but we need\nTo really rethink how transportation happens ah and if we're going to have real sharing a of of vehicles or whether it's on transit or in you know lifting other modes that we've got to be giving them priority and that's a whole separate issue\nMaking rose Nikki transportation is a big sometimes number two expense for some people after after housing you know our scooters bikes kind of making mobility more affordable and accessible for low income communities\nAnd I would definitely say more affordable died on accessibility kind of depends on the the company itself and I'm like like one example so with with the John ... jump bikes\nWhich still ... they they first launched in a low income area in the city of San Francisco to\nJust the kind of more deliberately say like hey we want to make sure that this is accessible to low income people from the get go and then once we know that that's going to work there and then we'll kind of broaden out the um like the pilot program essentially\nAnd that is part of the requirements for San Francisco's permitting process to show okay how are you going to make sure that your\nAh that that this form of transportation is accessible to under served communities\nLess and less of the best solution for certain types of trips especially in cities and has said he's getting more dense and as\nYou know e commerce delivery trucks are blocking lanes or as lifting Hoover cars are pulling over there's a sense of well as the Carl and really the fastest in most effective way to get around\nTo the bike lane has you know a growth in popularity so if you look at the even long standing programs like city bike\nIn New York or you've seen ridership grow in the popular in the program increase and then separately there is a technology component to this now everyone has a smart phone they can hail a car just you know by pushing the few buttons on that phone they can uh you can embed those same phone components into a vehicle for very very low cost and now these vehicles can have GPS\nThey can have sensors to detect if they've fallen over or not\nThey have full time sim card cellular connection to the Internet that's all been brought about by smartphones and so if you look at the cost of building something comparable to the segue from Fifteen Years ago in performance it's much less expensive today and then it's also being used in a way where people feel oh this is this is actually a better solution for me to in the car that I used to use Stuart\nCohen how big of a ... you know transformation is just going to be\nA ... in transportation I'd like to also connected to autonomous vehicles you know that same technological change the subject just described is coming toward vehicles and there's a lot of hype and the excitement about autonomous connected electric and shared vehicles are we going to other scooters or ... what we're going to see in cars\nAnd the greenhouse gas production potential is huge greenhouse gases from transportation about twenty eight percent of all greenhouse gases\nIn this country we're talking about new ability I climb at one time for our lightning round I'll mention a noun or and you're going to say the first thing that comes to mind unfiltered reckless abandon whatever that comes through your mind first and then also have a true false portion so first\nA Sunday to store what comes to mind when I say scooter boroughs\nAre unfortunate making rose Dickey zombie cars\nNamed to get people onto trains and buses very false [noise]\nSunday drugstore true or false one day a big automaker will buy electric scooter company true last one a true or false making rose Dickey you recently visited a two straightening start up and found out you needed a root canal\nYet but what does that have to do your Twitter feed so I figure yeah rebels down I had my crowd it was a whole thing but yeah\nThank you for your job you put it on Twitter feed let's give them around for getting through that [noise]\nYou're listening to a conversation about new forms of shared an electric transmit this is climate one coming up ... just how much energy we can see by not choosing the car for\nA short trip what's really interesting about vehicles that are designed for the bike lane is that the consumption per mile is so low that you could really look at how do you reduce the energy footprint of our transportation\nThat's up next we're wanting to seniors [noise] ooh [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to climate one red Dalton is talking about the new urban mobility Megan Rosa Dickey senior reporter was French Stuart Cohen executive director transformed ... T. O. skip scooter\nSon Jake talk about job creation one of the criticisms of rubber lift as if those are not really real jobs or their their side\nLines for people some similar things happening and scooters where people can collect scooters and charged him overnight get paid to address the employment and job side of the scooters that yeah it's it's really interesting I I think it's kind of a double\nEdged sword I mean the fact that I could choose to start a new job you know in the gig economy and a week later or even less be earning money is really powerful right when people have a change in their financial circumstances or when they just choose to to make a change in their life\nOn the ability to kind of on board that very quickly versus going through a vocational program or long training program or a university degree means that you can really start earning money quickly whether that's through start ups like air being being renting out your home or\nYou know instill cart indoor dash and post made center who bring left you know you can earn money and a lot of different ways so I think\nI'm this is another way for people to do that and it's it's great because it matches that need and that desire from folks with the fact that he's scooters do need to get charged moved and everything I think in the long run it's important like with all of these companies to have some kind of sustainable\nUm and predictable way for people to engage on the labor side I mean what about with training whether that's with\nNo benefits whether they should be contractors or W to employees I mean that that's an important conversation that that we're seeing and I think especially for transportation systems um if you look at mass transit if you look at a ride share now especially um there's a sense like these are here to stay\nAnd so we should be investing not just for the next thirty days or sixty days of the start ups life but actually over many years to make sure this is an important part of the fabric of the of the community um so we're making a lot of investments in San Francisco\nTowards training for things like maintaining the scooters repairing them um we've made some big commitments to some groups on this part of our permit process to say what we'd actually like to do this the right way and not just a bring up a bunch of gig economy workers um and then have no nothing for them on the back and\nBegin rose Dickie ... will do the gig economy workers come out and and after they pay for the electricity grid or they cut it out of hand\nI tell my boss he he asked me if I Would like sign up to be a lime juice or or whatever and I which is like what they call their chargers um and I mean he can get like\nAt least like five dollars per scooter or something um but then I had to fill out like a W lying and blah blah blah and then it would could complicate my taxes and then I was thinking well what about my energy to connect Spencer my energy bill so [laughter] I said no [laughter] but it I\nI think that that was one one issue like I'm not sure if these people are going to see like higher energy bills but\nIt also just the the issue with the gig economy is that there's no insurance or health benefits and so you're really just kind of on your own for this to be even though yes some companies are saying well like we're providing jobs people in these low income areas it's like\nOK cool but these are like really good jobs like these are in jobs that are going to really like help people with their quality of life\nRight sounds pretty darn complicated but you just described going through all those who are just trying to understand your electricity bill without charging scooters is this is a challenge\nStuart ... before we go to audience questions I Want to come back to the times square the New York city story because that was really seminal that really set off a national wave of you know redoing American cities and bikes would tell us the times square story that happened under Mayor Bloomberg\nOh sure so uh they had a visionary department a trance\nOur own for this to be even though yes some companies are saying well like we're providing jobs people in these low income areas it's like OK cool but these are like really good jobs like these are in jobs that are going to really like help people with their quality of life\nRight it sounds pretty darn complicated but you just described going through all those who are just trying to understand your electricity bill without charging scooters is is is a challenge\nStewart come before we go to audience questions I Want to come back to the times square the New York city story because that was really seminal that really set off a national wave of you know redoing American cities in bike so tell us to Times Square story that happened under Mayor Bloomberg\nOh sure so uh they had a visionary department of transportation commissioner Jeanette ... Khan who really said you know these streets are for all people and not just for vehicles and\nUh in Manhattan the most dramatic thing they make ... create many squares uh and many bike lanes but they Times Square where you could barely walk on the sidewalk and everybody's trying to take pictures and is a dangerous situation\nThey started with a kind of one of the biggest forms of what they call tactical urbanism where you just set something up for six months or a year as a pilot project sometimes you can do it for a day just like painting or parking day where you take over a parking lot\nOr and they set it up there was conjecture that there would be you know\nCongestion was already crazy so it would be you know the uh people wouldn't be able to get through in ... I'm On the traffic um but they made it work uh and uh the traffic mostly works about the same as it did before a in terms of the car speed but like you now have is this incredible place this gathering place\nOr where most of the street space has been given over to people and they've\nNow made it permanent at first they threw down beach chairs and they made a permanent but the great thing is it's being replicated all over the country I was the most highly visible one um and you even see places that you don't think of in Indianapolis or Fort Worth Texas\nI'm saying hey we should make our downtowns vibrant\nAnd have that attract you know residents and businesses and you know things on Fort Worth they had thirty five\nAcres in the center of the town and a lot of it was parking lot and\nThey started showing movies and having games and dances and ah and then it built the momentum for this or Sundance Square that it's called that now it's kind of a just a wonderful you know outdoor living room for the city and the more that we can\nCreate places you know we used to have a ten years ago to talk about walkable urbanism really great places to walk and now you know are increasingly focused on kind of ... urbanism places that you just want to be a want to be able to be with friends family um and the trick is how we keep these places affordable because\nIt's incredible once you have a wonderful urban place like these places you might visit around the world in Europe and elsewhere a it's a huge a tractor and the thing that we're losing in San Francisco with it and in other places as the diversity that originally made a great\nUh and that attracted so many of us so I think with this conversation a lot of it ends up leading to focus on equity and uh the reason we're in the game on on all of this new mobility we have a report called framework for social equity a new mobility it's kind of\nHow do we make sure that if Logan folks are spending thirty one percent of their income on transportation now that as we roll out these new models\nThey're incredibly accessible they're located in the places for the people that need them most and they're used not as a form of displacement of gentrification like there is sometimes seen but they're used as a way to bring down the transportation costs an increase access that we can actually keep people here", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Your World", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "18"}
