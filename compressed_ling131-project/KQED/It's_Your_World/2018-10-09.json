{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KQED", "content": "You're listening to ... San Francisco and ... north highland Sacramento it's two o'clock\n[noise]\nWelcome to world affairs the weekly broadcast in the world affairs counsel I'm Jane ran off the EL while we've always argued that the U.S pays me indispensable role in the international community [noise] President Trump has said that his policies will be about America First he\nReiterated proposition ... joining us to discuss the Mac first policy is an economist Jeffrey Sachs\nHe's a professor at Columbia University author of a new book I never find policy moderating the program as Michael ... is this ... is made possible each week probably generous supportive Chevron knee I'm rare victory for vacations caplin foundation\nJeffrey Sachs welcome to world affairs could be with you thank you you know of that phrase American exceptionalism is pretty soft clay like patriotism itself it means different things when different people say what do you mean when you said\nI mean the way that it has been used throughout American history that America is\nAn exceptionally a positive force in the world and therefore has prerogative attacked in the world in ways that other countries do not\nAs America has been called the indispensable country it's been called to the new Rome it's been called to the unit polar power the sole superpower but uh American leaders have said typically claimed that America has the rights to act because\nIs in the vanguard is in the right eye and that the world depends on American action I'm arguing ... of course this is ah in in my view a lot of hubris and has gotten us into an enormous amount of trouble\nOver generations but in the last twenty five years has embroiled us in countless wars and a vastly overstretched military and now a breakdown of international cooperation and many other spheres as well\nWill go along with a new Rome which I think implies one kind of place it's also being called called itself or a new Jerusalem a new Eden and by extension that special gifted land was home to a special gifted people\nIs their historic evidence for this is this just a sentimental notion\nWe're definitely the sentiments of the early uh English\nAmerican settlers who said we're establishing a new Jerusalem or and they looked explicitly to the Bible and to to the belief in a presidential backing a\nAs they in fact America began its expansion across the continent in involving wars for two centuries against Native Americans\nEach victory proof of it ... the backing of Providence and the idea of American exceptionalism became very deep of course there were positive exceptional aspects of America the\nAspirations of a democratic and constitutionally ruled society is a remarkable\nAchievement much in the twentieth century this sense of destiny the manifest destiny that led the expansion across the American continent and lead to a\nGrowing bravado in the world\nOr at the end of the nineteenth century of course America as international empire began with the Spanish American war which was a kind of a war of pretext or that allow the United states to grab Cuba Puerto Rico and the Philippines in its first foray into international imperialism\nIn the first half of the twentieth century\nAmerica station troops invaded overturned governments relentlessly throughout the Caribbean Central America I reached into South America and after World War two finally America was\nThe most powerful country in the world by far\nI Henry loose the editor of time magazine of course famously Christ and I the world war two and post World war two arrows the American century\nAnd America reached out partly it in a it's a perceived service of defending freedom in the Cold War and partly for a ... or their motivations to\nEstablish a military bases in dozens of countries around the world into\n... indeed create a military reach and the power that was on rivaled in history and I wonder can now assessed\nIn history and I want you can now assess a Seventy years later\nWhere are we uh what has happened with all of this what should we do and\nDonald Trump makes this even more urgent because now we have a a an absolutely a singular\nExperience with the a a president who believes that he will individually call the shots in the world and uh and and uh does exercise uh his individual discretion\nI he's been called to many things ah\nAh an isolationist sometimes which I think is completely inaccurate [noise] but I Would say that the biggest characterization is that he is a unilateral is he believes he lacked in America should act whenever wants wherever wants that there are no rules per se there's only deal making\nThreats bravado\nAnd I believe that this is yet another ramping up of this exceptional ... idea that we are a country that doesn't have to behave by any rules about our own\nAnd I find that a a new ratcheting up of danger\nThat unilateral is to view\nWent intend them in that and\nYou know not just recent history but to let a fairly long history now of the rest of the world are looking to the United states in sometimes intractable circumstances\nAre waiting for the United states to act a\nThere are many cases where yeah I mean I you'd dismissed the idea of a of the United states any longer being an indispensable nation\nBut there have been many circumstances where um the fractious alliances the um inconclusive wars of the old world are suddenly reach you kind of in passing the world looks to the United states to do something\nWell I think that uh there are a there's\nA couple of cases that are absolutely notable and remarkable and positive in that way and probably the\nMost important is a church or looking to the United states to the new world to save the old world from fascism and this was America's greatest moment in in fact\nI in World War two but there are\nMany many many many more cases where the world is rather aghast at a what America is doing from Vietnam to the war on Saddam Hussein in two thousand three\nTo the overthrow of literally dozens of governments around the world and assassination of political leaders around the world by the CIA\nSo no I don't believe that the world has waded in bated breath for America to come to the global rescue what I Do think is absolutely true\nIs that individual countries and often scoundrels I have an appeal to the U.S to back them in their particular local battle against somebody else\nAnd often in mashed the United states than a horrible local wars in which we have no stake\nAnd most recently I think are Saudi ... counterparts are Israelis and a Turkish counterparts are\nConvinced President Obama that did it was very important to overthrow Syria's a leader Bashar al Assad\nIn a two thousand eleven that was not the world appealing for this the ... that many countries warned the United states don't get into that snake pit but President Obama signed day CIA order to have the CIA cooperate with Saudi Arabia to overthrow\nThe Syrian regime we heard almost nothing about this in our media or last march in fact I we\nUnited Nations to secure the global peace\nAnd America championed bad for you I from Nineteen forty five on word in on the easy relationship with the exceptionalism so there was a battle\nFor the hearts and minds I Would say of America and its self image and vision and understanding of the world\nBut there was a strong feeling that create a rule of law create a international trade under principled agreements or first does something called the gap now something called the world Trade Organization\nChampion international agencies to fight disease and to fight hunger I empower the United nations and\nGo to war in Korea under a vote of the U.N Security council I appear or as a president or before the U.N General assembly not to attack it\nBut to to appeal for a rule based system is President Kennedy did and some of the most eloquent speeches ever made by an American president to the United nations now we have a snarling antagonist\nAre expressing hostility and disdain when Trump goes before the general assembly I've watched him now twice a close up and it said to my taste horrifying\nSo I think I I'm Still clinging\nTo bad idea that also America itself has had that the real safety for our country and the real security for the world and the real ability\nTo face profoundly important\nComplex challenges managing our oceans of fighting environmental disaster protecting us from the hole and the ozone of fighting climate change requires global cooperation mutual respect\nAnd a body of international law\nThat's of course what I'm arguing for in this book that that is not naive that is a a correct idea\nAnd what is true also perhaps surprising is that the opinion surveys demonstrate time and again that despite\nThe backhanded way that many of us actions have created\nThe un sometimes mocking sometimes full disdain often under league direct repudiation is going to war against Saddam Hussein when the U.N Security council absolutely would not back to have\nThe American people by a significant majority view the United nations as a force for good typically around Seventy percent approval rating and that in a country where many\nGood typically around Seventy percent approval rating and that\nIn a country where many a state political parties like the the Republican Party of taxes called routinely get out of the un get to you and out of the United states a banner shit from uh our shores ... the large majority of the American people\nHave not seen it that way that gives me hope and I suppose the bats the foot hold on which this book rats\nWhether it's taking on American exceptionalism as an idea whether it's a encouraging a reinvigorated ... of the United states' commitment to the United nations whether it's just\nTaking you read or by the hand and courage ing\nHim or her to have a different view of this country's role in the world or you're asking a lot you're asking are reframing on the part of the reader from everything they might have heard since they were a student in in ah in elementary school\nWell let's take a specific case that you offer\nThat an outcome of this um reframing of the American role in the world could be for instance the end of military action in the middle east that's a brief some suggestion\nAnd wanting to make fairly early on what would that look like a this is a place where the United states has been vitally engaged in the entire post war era and even before\nAbsolutely right and in my view of the middle east is that we are still fighting the wars that were created by the imperial pretensions of Britain and France or in World War one eye when the Ottoman Empire\nFell I Britain and France the to a European imperial powers\nI decided that they would be up to divvy up the middle east eyes so France Scott Lebanon Britain got Palestine and Iraq I they shared\nA influencing responsibility in\nSyria I and I began\nImmediately in the Nineteen twenties air bombings in Iraq grabbing oil I playing the imperial game\nAnd it was violence it was utterly deceitful\nOr it continue ... mainly because of the quest for\nOil and Britain's I view that its hold on Egypt and eight and a and a ... a ... the Suez Canal was vital for its sea route to India and therefore the military base of\nThe British Empire when\nWorld War two and did I step by step the United states entered as the new imperial power basically in the region taking over the wars and the influence the CIA went to work\nI engaged in multiple coups overthrowing governments are trying to craft\nI the politics of the region are you mentioned already Nineteen fifty three when I Britain and the U.S or are you know the CIA and ... and and my six I came down to overthrow\nThe government of Iran because the government of Iran had the absolute audacity audacity to think that ah the oil there was Iran's not Britain's\nAnd it was time for that the leader most should act to do and they installed to the shah of Iran and the police state that kept him in power until Nineteen Seventy nine\nI in Nineteen eighty after the Iranian Revolution the United states are armed Saddam Hussein to battle in ... absolutely brutal war including a chemical weapons attacks that we knew when and effectively aged I by\nSaddam on Iran so we continued our war on the Iranian people I we've been doing this re for a now Seventy years what do we have to show for it I what we have our eye\nWars that stretch from Afghanistan or through Iraq through\nSyria Yemen I instability I everywhere I and\nHave a hundred of absolute addiction to never leaving a place that we have entered if you notice no president ever withdraws any place that we have been we always need to keep a military base for the reason you said once we're there\nIf we leave something bad may happen\nBut the fact that we're there is already bad [laughter] it's we are overstretched we are not just overstretched we are completely illegitimate leash where we should not be\nAnd we are not creating peace we are not creating order we created a lot of hatred a lot of instability and a lot of\nIllusion\nWhere we our appeal to every day by some faction somewhere save us from our enemy we don't\nSave us from our enemy we don't know who these enemies our CIA is paid who's been funded by Saudi Arabia for a long time on many different things and\n... supposedly we're there to do the bidding of these powers now for example to be in this a\nSkirmish which could get a heck of a lot hotter between Saudi Arabia and Iran\nSo my point is that this doesn't work at all or if it is true or if you view the world like\nThe game of risk for listeners who a play that game if you don't have your piece on some property in the world some other opponent may habit and that indeed is the argument\nOverthrowing the government through a military operation not approved by\nThe the United Nations no not the slightest interest at all so we are re far from I what I'm suggesting I all I can do is\nTo explain why I think I were on a dangerous course which I Do\nA and I'm hoping that somehow this can be at least a modest part of a\nNational discussion to regain our senses are that are at a minimum we need to re democratize foreign policy if we want to have a democracy and that democracy is absolutely ... when it comes to work\nOf course the is absolutely hate it when it comes to our international outside a ... almost ... non functional now\nBut this were locked in this sense of being stuck\nComes at a time when the United states is a a declining share of world productive capacity and declining share of world GDP um it is fascinating that this world that you're explaining to the reader\nSeems less and less suited for the twenty first century where the United states is still rich still powerful steel productive but a lot of other places in the world are too and instead of that leading to a more cooperative\nWorld system it's leading to one where of our politicians are insisting in both parties\nOn American freedom of movement and unilateralism\nThis is a part of the debate and I I make the point is an economist at\nThe American century I was a call to dated in Nineteen forty one and really in its full glory in the late forties and early fifties\nAt an extraordinary moment when in World War two most of the other industrial countries had been destroyed by war and for the United states the war experience was a it's\nAn unbelievable boom of industrial might\nAnd technological prowess so the United states really dominated the world economy and was so far ahead technologically and managerial you an organization only of even Europe or Japan or China was a complete no show at the time\nOr that one could believe in in that right or wrong\nIn that capacity to shape the world's in one's image now since then the\nTechnological capacity first of course was restored to Europe early on through reconstruction the rise of Japan and the rise of many other\nAsian countries and then most consequential early or the soaring remarkable I economic rise of China in the last forty years\nSo from my take it's exactly as you say I feel that we're like the cartoon character that runs off the cliff\nBut in the cartoon hangs there I'm believing that everything is fine until they look down and then boom or they they start to plummet\nThat's my view or not that we're going to plummet but that we haven't recognized the changing shape of the world\nIf you ask Donald Trump says he no doubt salmon idiot\nI ... America's the greatest we've got the biggest stock market boom we've got this we've got that were are the superpower I we can walk to anybody trade wars are easy will contain China I think the view is\nI actually taking on a substantively that claim a that a hell no one can mess with us and I view it as very naive I I see with my own eyes\nCountries around the world it by the way almost anywhere you go in the world be infrastructure is brighter more sparkling at airports are brighter more sparkling then you find in the United states where our infrastructure is forty or fifty years old\nOn so I don't feel that uniqueness in that sense of bravado but definitely that is the perception from inside the United states and it's no doubt or the perception and Donald Trump's had\nThere's this idea that cooperation that interdependence is we're wimps is ...\nUh but you write cooperation is not blind trust and it should not be naive or unconditional and you posit that gains can be large and mutual you are a optimistic idealistic\nAbout an idea that still seems a long way off in our politics\nWell definitely as we\nBelieved for a long time actually that you don't really need\nA broad cooperation you'll find coalitions of the willing at best and that sense for powerful and we can lead we can always poll\nDozens of countries along with us so the\nPhrase coalition of the willing was to has been an organizing principle for how America goes to war we don't need consensus or agreement in the United Nations Security council we just need a coalition of the willing\nAnd therefore blocked by China Russia and the Security Council who cares or we can get our our lives on board and we can still go do the things that\nBig men really do and that is I absolutely the view I don't think cooperation is for wimps then I don't think the law is for wimps I think it is the only way we figure it out in large complex societies\nA to a operate without disaster and\nTo my mind this really is a the the point\nAnd to my mind this really is that the point I Know as a as an economist who's been doing these things for\nDecades that the quality of our life and the complexity of our economy is not the bravado of some businessman it is based on\nFunctioning systems of infrastructure energy water\nFood production transport civil aviation Internet\nAnd that all of these are complex international systems that require common standards\nShared behaviors I and to [noise] agreement on functioning eye and expertise by the way expertise it's really crucial for us to be able to have clean water in the morning\nAnd so this is not acts of bravado\nDishes acts of complexity and basic common interest now we know of course we I can say we know how many people are for whatever reason in denial but we do know scientifically that we have shaken the planet\nWith the climate disaster\nWith a profound uh poisoning or and destruction of the oceans are with a massive destruction of\nThe biome Zinn ecosystems on which we depend in which to use and other wimpy phrase I suppose that we are the stewards for the future\nAnd to get a handle on any of those is so complex even from a technical point of view\nTo be engaged in this kind of a drove lotto showdown unilateral is politics when we are utterly need to problem solving at a highly sophisticated technical level is mind boggling to me\nWell we get the ah the rare historic privilege in\nThis era of watching another country joined the historic roll call of great powers\nIs China going to be different as it gets richer as it seeks to a expressed its will commercially and politically in far flung flung places in the world as it as search its muscle in the south China Sea\nOr is this a model that all great powers go through rise and decline\nOr or is there going to be something different about China Kennett resist\nMaking what you suggest there's some of the mistakes that the United states has in the last several decades\nI think what is a true is one very important to point there's no doubt though which oversimplified no doubt that in historical terms", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Your World", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "09"}
