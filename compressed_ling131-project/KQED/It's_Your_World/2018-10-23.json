San Francisco and kick you we I north highlands Sacramento good morning I'd Michael state that look like\n[laughter]\nWelcome to world affairs the weekly broadcast in world affairs counsel I'm Jane land is your host\nThe role of us need to shift around the world is changing and they're very views about the consequences what does it mean for trade for climate change for nonproliferation for war and peace and unstable regions joining us to share his views Nicholas Burns of the Harvard Kennedy School of government\nAmbassador burns was the U.S ambassador to NATO and the ambassador Klee he also served as spokesman er the state department and later as under secretary of state for political affairs for disclosure were colleagues on the national Security Council\nThis broadcast is made possible each week and I think generally supportive center on me I'm aware Draper we just kept on foundation\nI wanted to start in Ecuador question I'm where I'm going to ask you to translate because foreign service officers can translate from any language and uh and I hadn't had that the opening of the United Nations General assembly President Trump said that\nThe United states now has a doctrine of um of patriotism\nPatriotism as love of country and doctrine is a set of guiding principles what does it mean to have a doctor and patriotism thanks for the softball question\nCan I say first\nIt's a real pleasure to be with Jane ah we're friends we've been friends for a long time we work together and government I greatly respect the work she's done here in San Francisco in the bay area I should say on the world affairs counsel so thank you and I'm from Boston grew up there a member of\nRed Sox nation we're feeling really good about ourselves you know it doesn't matter if the red Sox win the world series we defeated the Yankees that's all that probably outweigh the San Franciscans feel about the Dodgers so you can understand [noise] um and I also\nWanted to say I'm a looking forward to a good conversation tonight it's a really important time for us I think it's a dangerous time and this is a good opening question and I'm not going to mince words all of us are patriotic\nI mean everybody I Know who lives in this country loves our country [noise] uh and there are times when you have to defend it come hell or high water and there are times when you have to be critical because that's being patriotic\nI think the founding fathers mothers would have expected of us that if things aren't going right in our democracy we stand up in a civil and peaceful way and hopefully in a respectful way\nAnd we give our voices in in criticism and so if I could translate Donald Trump at the United nations two weeks ago I think what he really is he's practicing nationalism\nNot patriotism\nAnd nationalism um it can be appropriate it also can be perverse it couldn't be were better than you are\nWe're better than anybody else um\nAnd to me America First or the way he's articulated it in a way he's practiced said it's a very negative force in our society because exclusionary it pushes people away\nAnd a time of real integration in the world where our economy is integrated around the world where the biggest problems I think that our kids especially\nAre going to face when we hand off the baton and we're handing out right now to our kids are the trans national issues like climate change and trafficking of women and the threat of pandemics\nThese are all problems that require us to be working across our borders building coalitions and you know when I worked for the two Bush is President George H W and President George W or Bill Clinton\nThey were coalition builder and they understood that President George W. Bush understood that Thirty years ago President Reagan understood it and to go back to a nationalist platform where everything has to be about us and we're not going to work with other countries and Justin Trudeau has become public enemy number one [noise] you know this is a\nI don't think we're heading in the right direction right right\nSo if if this is kind of I I'm a fancy way to say America First and sometimes America only and one of his last given greatest expression is in the area of trade yeah I'm at President Trump pulled out of the Trans Pacific partnership which was twelve Asian\nPulled out of the Trans Pacific partnership which was twelve Asian countries had excluded China um but some of our closest ally in their style ya Japan etc most solid without us yeah at ... and moving followed it as ours now where the ones that out in\nChina is not with animals that that turned out to be in our interest\nNo of course not I mean I think that the the Trans Pacific partnership forty percent of global GDP in the countries that were had already signed up for it to twelve countries as as you said um that was our big power moves against China because China has been manipulating its currency\nNot playing on a level playing field on trade\nViolating its commitments one of the world Trade Organization China needed to be held to account for that the way to do it was to get the countries of our hemisphere\nAnd if you just think about our hemisphere is Canada the United states and Mexico and Peru in Colombia and she lives very much western hemisphere with some of the big countries in Asia like Japan\nOr that was that was our move to force China to conform to to play fair and to abide by the rules and when the president pulled us out it gave China major break the Chinese couldn't believe that they\nReceived this gift in the first week of the administration so I think that the president's notion that he rejects all multilateral trade agreements and they've lifted a lot of votes over the last forty or fifty years they've not only made us prosperous they've made lots of other countries prosperous [noise] um I think it was a mistake\nUm the idea that you could take apart NAFTA we modernize NAFTA NAFTA was the world of Nineteen Ninety three Ninety four so I Do get modernizing NAFTA I I thought the way he did it was unnecessarily future lipstick with Canada especially but also with Mexico [noise] let me say something in his defense however\nHe's right to go after the Chinese and the stand up to them and what I've noticed just traveling I was in I think I've been seven European countries in the last couple of months\nUm is the Europeans\nQuietly cheering on Donald Trump\nAnd many of the Asian countries are in taking on China I I this this trade war is is is a little bit tricky\nYou don't want to take it so far into the future and and you want them numbers to add up so much that it begins to hurt our economy but I think making the point to the Chinese buffet have to be accountable uh and they have to adhere to rules is a good one and I think Donald Trump has a lot of the world behind him now that he is fixed\nOf sorts we can't call it an act anymore\nThe U.S Canada Mexico or U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement [noise] he's made up with the European Union we don't have a fix right now with the European Union but we've agreed on a non aggression packed with him on trade\nHe is made up with a Japanese and South Koreans so he's kind of cleared the decks and I think that's the right thing for him to do\nWe have to defend ourselves on trade a lot of Americans have lost jobs\nIn key parts of our country because the Chinese have not been fair and and I do think heat the presence right to do this\nSo we're now in a sellout trade war with China yeah and and I I think the question is what position of terrorists\nUh our American consumers hurt or we heard in our own economy or that reaction to a real life problem outlined less damaging to us as well as to them\nWell there's no question that some industries some parts of the farm belt are going to be hurt by a prolonged trade war with China you have to calculate if you're the U.S trade representative Robert Lighthizer is a very smart guy\nOr certainly the president's got to calculate how far do you take it I don't think the Chinese they're so self confident now and she's in paying has so much riding on his own economic agenda he's not going to case\nSo the end of this is going to be some kind of a win win solution hopefully after the Chinese have made commitments to us and to the rest of the world that would repair some of their very injurious trade practices you know I'm someone who does not want to make China into an enemy\nAnd I think there's a lot we ... we need to do with China as partners as well as competitors and we're both with China\nBut I Do agree on trade that the time has come to stand up to the\n... ... s partners it I think North Korea is a great example the ... the Chinese yeah very ... so and I I guess I part of me wants to ask you in fact I Will ask you [laughter]\nUm whether we picked the right battle but maybe at the wrong time because we need that shiny so much right now\nBy all the fall of the Soviet Union prudent infamously I think said the greatest catastrophe the twentieth century was the fall of the Soviet Union most of us would say the greatest\nTriumph or one of them of the twentieth century and foreign policy was the fall of the Soviet Union but they feel humiliated by it they were one of the two strongest powers in the world they're clearly not now China is\nIn every metric of power economic political soft power military power China is vastly superior they've passed the Russians\nThe Russia's GDP is about what Spain's GDP is this is not a super power except for the dimension of space and nuclear weapons they feel humiliated by that loss and I think it does drive by shooting you know why did he go into Syria during the refugee crisis of the autumn of two thousand Fifteen three years ago it really wasn't\nTo advance of all of Russia's interest they wanted to retain their naval base there\nI think it was to cut the U.S down to size show that the U.S maybe President Obama hesitated\nHe hesitated big time in Syria he couldn't quite make up his mind what he wanted to do including saw weakness\nAnd decided I Want to take advantage I'm going to humiliate the United states\nWhich in many ways is what he's done he's become the king pin Syria we are falling from grace we no longer have that influence that all of our presidents had from really Richard Nixon to the second term uh Brock Obama President Obama for a lot of reasons we can argue whether he was right or not I think he was probably wrong\nDecided that the lesson he learned from our ill fated in interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan don't enter the middle east but were twelve million homeless people twelve million homeless out of a population of twenty two point four million in Syria\nOr it's been a catastrophe and I'm not saying we should have put a hundred thousand American troops in but could we put [noise]\nCould we have set up I'm safe zones on the Jordanian and Turkish borders at least protect and some of the refugees we could have done this militarily without exposing our soldiers to too much harm it would have been risky in many ways\nUm and so potent took advantage of that and I think that was part of the calculation that he can't really compete with us but he wants to block us and he wants to diminish us as part of his\nCalculation [noise] um she had had an experience with us in in a in the case of um of Libya\nWhere as there was a situation where there was a civil war question is do we intervene um we chose to intervene in that case and and and then they shouldn't change trade fast yeah from a responsibility to protect\nInnocent civilian the innocent civilians to regime change yeah that was on the face and I'm just positive unless you can tell me I'm wrong for Russia an ally as of yet to let that happen had it happened\nAnd he wants to diminish as as part of his calculation\n[noise] um he had had an experience with us in in a in the case says I'm of Libya\nWhere at and they there was a situation where there was a civil war question is do we intervene um we chose to intervene in that case and and and the nation changed very fast yeah from a responsibility to protect\nInnocent civilian the innocent civilians to regime change yeah that was on the face and I'm just Pasadena she can tell me I'm wrong for Russia an ally as of yet to let that happen\nHad it happened again in Syria had we entered and gone for regime change our head at the Russians kind of given us a green light to take action wouldn't credibility as an ally be gone to an around\nYeah yeah so that you remember that the intervention in Libya and two thousand eleven was actually authorized by the United Nations Security council\nRussia ... NATO\nRochelle tomatoes NATO operation the Russians decided not to veto because we had made the argument the United states France and Britain that there were thousands of civilians that could be massacred by Gadhafi invent gossipy and at the United nations had to um NATO had to go in and blessed by the un to protect them that was the mission\nAnd we accomplish that mission we prevented a humanitarian disaster in that first phase of Libya operation but then when NATO got in\nNATO essentially decided and mainly led by the Europeans by the way this was not President Obama he wanted prime minister Cameron in President Sarkozy to lead they did they wanted to go after coffee and destroy his regime and and the Russians felt betrayed\nThat they felt that they had failed and they decided not to block\nThis mission because it was ... and they didn't know it would be regime change and so um I think the Russians probably have a point there it's a minor debating point in my view but they have a point\nYou want to get to the larger question whether we are right to expand NATO\nThank you I like last year long story really is a time when they were doing a\nRussian policy in and the national Security Council and did it turn out to be the right choice\nThink it did I I worked for President George W. Bush Condi Rice and I were the two person Soviet team in the last two years of the Cold War\nSARS actually on December twenty fifth Nineteen Ninety One Christmas Day\nWas a note taker on the phone from my home in Virginia and ... when President Bush wish Gorbachev farewell saw the end of the Soviet Union and masterful masterful worker President Bush and secretary James Baker [noise]\nI mean I think two of the finest public servants I ever worked for I admire both of them so much\nThey were able to convince Gorbachev to end the Cold War peacefully\nThey were able to engineer the unification of Germany without a shot being fired how many people would have bet on that\nThe day the wall came down on November Nine thirty nine and did that within ten months of the wall coming down\nI'm just in Berlin last week our daughter and one of our daughters lives in Berlin um you know went to the Brandenburg Gate is well pass the time now but it's still dramatic to think about what happened there were so skillful in handling Gorbachev President Bush and President Clinton I work for him for two years in that same job where so skillful\nAnd trying to make Russia into a partner of the United states\nAnd for a number of years you know we didn't plan on expanding NATO we thought we could live with Russia as a partner we thought Russia had a chance to become a democratic country Russia was a democratic country from Nineteen Ninety or the end of Ninety One until maybe Ninety six Ninety seven but that democracy melted\nAnd the economy imploded and all the people on fixed incomes ended up living in poverty\nA and corruption set in and a lot of the advice that we gave them we have to take some responsibility for this you know how to your transition from a command economy to a market economy when we when we say shock therapy well about thirty Russians fabulously wealthy they turn out to be the ... sharks\nAnd all that most Russians suffered and by the by Ninety six Ninety seven Ninety eight we concluded in the Clinton Administration that Russian democracy was failing as was going to fail there was a big strategic vacuum in central Europe all the countries that have been part of the Warsaw Pact\nPoland and the Czech Republic and Slovakia and hungry and Slovenia and Romania and Bulgaria and particularly the three Baltic states as stony Alaskan Lithuania that have been forcibly incorporated for fifty years of the Soviet Union\nThey were not part of any block they were not part of NATO or the European Union and we feared that if an authoritarian leader came back in Moscow and he came back in Nineteen Ninety nine named Vladimir potent heat that person would click with quickly want to consolidate control of the east of Eastern Europe\nAnd a lot of us felt I was not alive\nIn the spring of Nineteen forty five when an ailing FDR\nAnd Churchill made this cruel deal with Stalin that he would effectively control Yalta Eastern Europe we were in a power position in Nineteen Ninety five Nineteen Ninety six Nineteen Ninety seven we could redeem that\nNature compromise that FDR insurance will made at the end of the second World War and these people about a hundred and Fifteen million people and all these countries could become free\nForever and all of them joined the EU and all of them join NATO and I'm so happy to this day that we expanded NATO up to the Russian border because if we hadn't pudding would be in a stone in last yet today\nAnd he'd be an aggressor in Eastern Europe and we'd be\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream thanks Sandy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home life by for ultimately there's been the home\nI'm very clearly is the defense of extending expanding NATO to include essential you up\nAnd and and the argument that was the right to say yeah yeah [noise] what is where some folks fall away is has a ... is stopping at the Russian border and I know we had the partnership for a spot yeah their argument is look at what we did after World War two with Germany\nA rather than isolate had defeated nation in fact you you you put it in the mix of um as a larger international order in which we have more in common than in conflict\nYou know we felt a principal I think it's interesting who's president I'm Bill Clinton President George W. Bush and President Obama all agreed and the strategy they all expanded NATO\nAnd they all supported the expansion of the European Union this took place or you know this took place over a Fifteen year period when three different stages and the principles that guided all three of those presidents when I work for a tour of President Clinton and President George W. Bush and I was an advisor in the\nTo every president we've worked for Jimmy Carter as where I started none of our presidents\nIn fact the cardinal rule was we're gonna disagree with our allies in private that was Ronald Reagan's real that was Richard Nixon's rule that was George W Bush's real just named three Republicans\nAnd and President Trump's role as I'm going to be extremely offensive to our best friends and I'm going to suck up and embrace our enemies I don't get it [noise] and it and it's\nIs absolutely it's outrageous that an American presidents during this I mean Jane we go all the way back to every president we've worked for Jimmy Carter is where I started none of our presidents in fact the cardinal rule was we're gonna disagree with our allies in private that was Ronald Reagan's rule\nThat was Richard Nixon's for all\nThat was George W. Bush as well just named three Republicans and and President Trump's role as I'm going to be extremely offensive to our best friends and I'm going to suck up and embrace our enemies I don't get it\nAnd it and it's not right and the Europeans are watching this and they were appalled by it and I'm appalled as an American\nDefeat us he does seem to think that the the smartest strategy with an autocrat is to fight a thumb does he does have a point at all\nNo [laughter] I think if you talk to them I mean I Wish we could have George Shultz here who lives in this great city\nNinety seven year old George Schultz who there's an amazing person I think I don't want to put words in his mouth but I I've learned from him I've learned for ... Baker I've learned from ... writes I've learned from Madeleine Albright Hillary Clinton Colin Powell all of our great secretaries of state I think we're all of them would say is\nOf course you want to establish a relationship even with an autocratic leader in a negotiation but we need to be tough and clear with those leaders we you know being nice them is not going to work and yeah\nSo so\nLet me take his you know keep keep on our relationship with Europe right now um [noise] that's you know based on a set of norms based on a set of institutions all of which we ... cars have advanced our economic and security interest for a while as as there is um\nWe we've always been a reliable partner are rarely interests are always taken into account on the understanding that there as well as well right now as you look at that last set of relationships and that with with your with your candidate on trees and with and with Europe it as a as an ACL any you\nUm are they trying to figure out\nHow to work with President Trump and that's very changed a virus that are they now trying to figure out okay how do we work without President Trump how do we work I shouldn't say president from how do we work with the United states as a major ally in a major force\nI think most of these European countries are allies including Japan and South Korea the strategy or most of them are trying to work with ...\nUm you know we're going to have a Seventy eighth anniversary of NATO in April for two thousand Nineteen and NATO's not going to have a summit meeting because and here's why they won't say this but I Know it's because they have no idea what President Trump would say he might disc the alliance\nAnd you know and all of our presidents have how these summits at NATO every single one of our presidents and on the fiftieth and sixtieth anniversary we had some is in Washington\nCan't trust the president so I think most of the government trying to work at the cabinet level there's deep respect for Madison ... around the world um there was deep respect for general McMaster as well I think there's a lot of respect for Vassar Nikki Haley who's announced yesterday she stepping down\nUm you know so I didn't mention John Bolton because I don't think there is that kind of respect for John Bolton um and so this is a problem for us in some on some issues climate change I think the Europeans the Japanese are trying to work with your great governor here\nAnd when Michael Bloomberg and with American NGOs and with our governor Charlie Baker Republican in Massachusetts He's for doing something about climate change and Governor Brown is of course yeah you're a great governor as governor Jerry Brown so um they see the power of California frankly your state\nWould you be the fifth or sixth largest economy if your sex it's an extraordinary thing\nAnd they see that at the grassroots level the great majority of Americans agree with signs of the inter governmental panel on climate change [noise] agree that we have to be part of the solution agree that we can't opt out there are a hundred and Ninety five nation states in the un there are a hundred and Ninety four signatories for the Paris Agreement one country\nThe second largest carbon emitters out so I think what's gonna happen whenever President Trump leaves office whether it's twenty twenty or twenty twenty four or you know whatever whether whether he resigns\nI think the government's will come back quickly the other governments to work with his successor 'cause I was no alternative given our power in the world I just wonder about average people in Germany or Japan\nUm and they look at us as this extremely wealthy country who's saying that the rest of the message to the rest of the road from us as on climate change sorry you're on your own we're just going to put money into call and we're going to really keep burning coal\nAnd that is offensive to a lot of people in Europe I was in Germany last week I as I told you the number one issue for most German citizens when you look out the world is climate change\nMaybe the number one issue for most Americans in the polls is terrorism for them this climate and we've sent them a pretty tough signal I don't think that comes back and in both issues we need one another we do and if you look at the if you haven't read the Pew poll and the Chicago Council calls they both came out last week there are extraordinary polls\nThey showed it for the Americans Republicans Democrats and all fifty states surveyed\nThe American people at Seventy six percent believe in NATO\nThe American people believe in trade the American people believe in immigration and refugee is because we're an immigrant nation they believe that we should be standing up for a democracy everything that President Trump hasn't done it's almost been a reaction in the American polls against what he said and the public opinion polls\nBut it shipped to the cake you weedy life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with a steady on demand\nStates and in Germany more people trust potent than trust Trump and Germany's an allied nation so we're in a deep hole in terms of our credibility\nAround the world and the other issue beyond climate and others we've talked about and that's Iran\nTheir age as the nuclear deal as a multilateral deal I European allies for a a part of it not only did we withdraw from the nuclear deal but we are exercising our rights secondary sanctions\nFirst describe a secondary sanctions are I don't know if they if they are new with that dealer they exist and other agreements I'm also ...\nRight yeah so I mean as Jane those I was George W. Bush and Condi Rice's around negotiator or we didn't get to the negotiating table we mainly sanctioned the Iranians are when President Obama and in our good friend Wendy Sherman who was a real heroin here\nWere able to negotiate the Iran nuclear agreement of two thousand Fifteen I very much supported them I testified before Congress on supporting President Obama I thought I didn't think it was a\nI didn't think it was a slam dunk there are a lot of things about the deal that bothered me but like any do you have to kind of way the positive negatives I thought it was kind of a sixty forty fifty five forty five in favor but I saw the downside [noise]\nUm but what what's that deal did was they were ... to a nuclear weapon through uranium enrichment and three plutonium processing\nWe force the Iranians to dismantle the industrial process sees that as set up and we could be absolutely sure that for Fifteen to Twenty years into the future passed two thousand Fifteen they were not going to be able to build a nuclear weapon for me that was good enough\n'cause you know you had to assume that the country might change their country not so much regime change just change between now and then in twenty thirty so I thought it was a mistake for President Trump to get out because um he's not replacing it with anything\nAnd if he drives a run into a corner they may go back illegally to try to develop a nuclear weapon then we're going to be back into this choice of whether we fight them or go back to negotiate we've already negotiated a pretty good\nAnd is it illegal for them to cut and they simply say look the U.S pulled out it's no longer viable deal\nWell under international under us sanctions have been reimpose under the nonproliferation agreement of Nineteen sixty eight is illegal for any country to develop nuclear weapons outside the five countries the permanent members of Security Council beyond states the United kingdom France then the Soviet Union\nA and China it's illegal for anybody to have nuclear weapons and and that we should honor that treaty and we shouldn't want to do anything that would allow countries to try to head down that road secondary sanctions and not only did we leave the Iran agreement in April\nOf two thousand this year which I thought was a mistake but I'm I don't I didn't get a vote on this one um the president's decided to impose secondary sanctions on our allies who negotiated in good faith with us over ten years", "show_name": "It's Your World", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "23"}
