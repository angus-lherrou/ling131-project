major events where the preacher began to show their influence was during the Egyptian revolution in twenty eleven [noise]\nDuring the actual Eighteen days of the uprising against Mubarak most people were not interested in watching the Saudi TV preachers there were very interested in watching BBC al Jazeera uh CNN and watching news coverage of the revolution\nBut immediately after Mubarak resigned people began to look to Islamic television preachers to offer them kind of commentary or solutions to the many political problems and economic problems that Egypt was facing\nSo it was interesting to see was how the Islamic television preachers I was working with began to re imagine\nTheir role as kind of social critics or as people who would offer various kinds of solutions to the different problems facing Egypt in the immediate aftermath of the revolution [noise]\nSo my ... is a very important to sonic media figure\nHe is a thirty something preacher who is currently pursuing a PHD at Cambridge University in the u._k. and over the past years Masood has really been pushing the boundaries of what Islamic media or Islamic television preaching looks and sounds like [noise]\nAnd I was\nRight after the revolution whereas the Masood releasing important program called a ... an Arabic or a revolution within a revolution of the south where he called on Egyptians to to become new kinds of people people who would kind of live up to the promise of\nRevolutionary Egypt in terms of democracy and coexistence intolerance and uh and civil disagreement\nAnd he did that through our religious idiom for most Muslims the solution to political and economic problems lies in a more correct understanding of what the Islamic tradition teaches and upholds\nSo when you tune into his YouTube channel you're going to find him singing with a guitar with one of Egypt or most famous revolutionary artists and he's going to be singing a song against a dogmatic thinking weather from a religious people or a non religious people [noise]\nAnd [noise] ...\nYou're going to find him starring in a TV drama series that also has a religious message to impart over thirty episode the stricken with them\n...\nSo those are the kinds of a new format that him and other features like him are really innovating in their attempt to reach new audiences to reach a young Muslims in ways that they will actually find compelling\nBut ... is just one of many prominent figures in the middle east right now and they don't all share the same ideas\nPrecisely because the Islamic television sector is largely privately owned and privately funded there exists a wide spectrum of theological an ideological orientations on Islamic television\nIslamic television is not a model if there's a wide diversity of viewpoints and religious scholarship that is regularly aired\nLet me think about extremism we also have to think about it's opposite which is moderation and the idea of religious moderation has a very long history within the Muslim world including in the pre modern era\nBut what moderation means and what voices get labeled as extremist is is not a stable thing it's it's constantly changing\nBut one thing is clear is that today for the vast majority of Muslims ISIS is an extremist group or in the sense that it's norms and practices are beyond the pale of what\nMost Muslims would agree their religion teaches and so when it comes to efforts to combat ISIS you're going to see a lot of cooperation among groups that normally don't get along\nAnd Islamic television preachers see themselves as having a very important role in disregard\nOr because they see their main role as teaching Muslims what Islam really means or what it really entails\nBut most of combating violent ideologies isn't always a huge priority for these preachers she says that's because relatively few people are actually recruited to join ISIS\nBeen a lot of panic lately about the recruitment success of ISIS among young Muslims but if you look at the numbers you realize this is really an unfounded panic even Tunisia out which has sent the most young people to ISIS as of last year it sent six thousand people\nNot Tunisia's population is twelve million\nAnd you can begin to to put the number of six thousand in perspective and that's the biggest the biggest sort of a country that has sent young people to ISIS and I think that the biggest counter narrative\nTwo groups like ISIS and their extremism actually comes from the reality that the vast majority of ISIS victims have been other Muslims\nAre not just Shiite Muslims but actually Sunni Muslims in the U.S um we tend to focus on ISIS attacks in western countries but ISIS has mostly been very active in Middle Eastern countries in November last year ISIS carried out one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Egyptian history\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by extending the firm Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home town of only seven hundred\nPeople [noise]\nSo myself half the population of of of this village so the biggest victims of terrorism committed by Muslims are actually other Muslims\nAnd so I think what we need is less religious counter narratives because those are alive and well I'm more of a treatment of the context that allow violent ideologies and the allergies to flourish and this would mean addressing structural problems like\nEconomic inequality political corruption as well as the human devastation brought by western military intervention in the region\nAnd I think you know us as American citizens we have an opportunity to hold our government accountable\nFor the ways in which it's policies un actions in the middle east have actually created a breeding ground for groups like ISIS [noise]\nThat's he asked me she's a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan [noise]\nIt's obvious that the media landscape in the middle east is vast and that means that for an outsider it's really hard to understand the U.S has tried to harness the power of the media there in order to promote its own interests but there are things us policymakers just don't get about how religious and political issues on line in the middle east\nThat's according to Nathan Brown he's a professor of political science at George Washington university\nWhat the United States is concerned about is often immediate security goals and it might be having to do with the the Israeli Palestinian conflict it might have to do with Syria might have to do with Yemen\nSo what we will sometimes do is come in and say okay this person is with us on the Palestinian issue with this government is with us on Yemen and therefore it sort of back them across the board\nAnd what we miss in the process is that there's a much much deeper dialogue going on that\nThe divisions are not really over short term policy issues but over long term concerns about the place of religion in public life about who has the authority to interpret Islam and that sort of thing and so we tend to be very short term and very clumsy in the way that we intervene in these things\nAnd a good example of that might be Saudi Arabia officially an ally despite its harsh treatment of dissidents and the lack of free speech there\nI think the American policy reaction has been very very short term and focus when ... been filming in Saudi Arabia talks is way when I'm just like to see the the president of Egypt talks this way", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Your
