Michael state the time to work\nGood evening welcome to tonight's cake you eat the public affairs special I'm Tania mostly ... Silicon Valley senior editor\nTonight ... presents remarks in conversation that took place on September ... that Silicon Valley leadership groups' annual twenty Eighteen game changers summit\nEvent was held at the computer history museum in Mountain View and it was hosted by Silicon Valley leadership CEO Carl Gore dino four major challenges for the bay area region were topics for the game changers presentations and discussion\nThe need for affordable housing they need for better transportation systems in options for commuters the need for affordable health care and the desire for expertise in successes that are hallmarks of Silicon Valley to extend to many other regions of our country\n[noise] the broadcast features San jose mayor Sam cardio in discussion about the need for more affordable housing with David ... chairman of the California simply housing committee\nExchanges followed by remarks from Sarah ... who is president and CEO upset or health\nProgram closes with a conversation between Steve Case and Greg Becker case is the legendary founder of AOL who currently heads up revolution a venture capital firm based in Washington DC Becker is president of Silicon Valley bank\nNow here in San jose mayor Sam ... in conversation with California simply mean David you with a discussion about housing in the bay area\nIt's a great pleasure of mind to be on stage here with a tournament choose someone I admire so much a you know I became uniquely aware of our housing crisis\nWhen I heard the story of a young lawyer who is looking to rent an apartment in San Francisco and he couldn't find anything terribly affordable and so he ended up renting a pretty rundown apartment in the tender line\nAnd sure enough he had a classmate who was on the east coast you got a job in San Francisco and my classmate couldn't find an affordable apartment either and so after a lot of searching eventually a classmate decided\nTo sleep\nOn the floor of the apartment of this young lawyer because there was no room for a couch\nNow\nI Know maybe you say this is not all that remarkable in twenty Eighteen we know well the housing crisis there certainly greater victims than these uh except that this is a story from Nineteen Ninety six and a young lawyer was me and the guy sleeping on the floor\nOr is now the chair of our assembly housing committee David show [noise]\n\nThe Morrow this story is is that this housing crisis is not new it's just gotten worse right and we all know that and in the last twenty two years certainly a lot has changed\nAs this housing crisis has gotten worse or David this now dressing much better than he did and Nineteen Ninety six up but we know the crisis is worse worse than despite the best intentions and best efforts of many and I can't say there have been\nRecent years extraordinary efforts made in city from the local perspective obviously I'm the mayor of a city and we cared a lot of what's happening within our borders and as we know are overwhelmingly land use decisions are the function of cities in their government\nAnd we've seen great progress in cities like San Francisco or leadership for mayor Lee aunt David True in two thousand Fifteen without ... to three hundred and ten million dollar housing bonds\nOr in cities like Oakland reliving shop over the last two years has been titled some Ninety seven hundred housing units tremendous leadership\nAnd in our own city our own county of Santa Clara ... two years ago the leadership of our county board passing a nearly ... billion dollar housing measure in the city of San jose several years ago we lead an effort to make than Jose the largest city in the country with a city wide\nInclusion or housing policy that we announced last year initiative to build twenty five thousand homes in the next five years and this November or with a measure measure be\nFour hundred and fifty million dollar housing bonds which will be the largest housing bond of any city in the state of California in our history all these are important and we know we need all these things to be successful it's all good now here's the rub\nNone of these efforts are these individual cities will suffice we know we're emerging from half decade in which throughout Silicon Valley we've added jobs at a rate six times the rate which we have added housing units\nAre we know that despite the best efforts of the large cities in our region and by the way I should add some of the uh smaller midsize cities here in Mountain View I think they're making tremendous progress\nA smaller midsize cities sheer amount and do I think they're making tremendous progress or we're not going to house\nOur bay area's population in just three cities and a few other towns that are willing to reach out and reach out we know we're going to need all one hundred and one jurisdictions working together in this area for really going to tackle\nThis housing crisis\nBecause of course land use is fundamentally a city function\nAnd we know that there are plenty of examples throughout our bay area a city that simply do not want to bury their responsibility for housing are rapidly growing population\nTo address the job growth that we have we have a name cities that for example where perhaps at three million square foot campus may have been built over a period of five years and in fact is zero housing unit added to that city in that period of time\nThat is not a solution I and there are many many others and so\nAs we grapple with this challenge or we know we need help\nFrom larger forces than just individual cities and so I had reached out to an old friend of mine who happens to be the chair of the housing committee and the assembly as we thought about how it is we can tackle this challenge in a more regional way\nHow can we ensure that all cities and towns in the bay area are varying responsibility for housing are rapidly growing population and with that I give you two are the great chair of the assembly housing committee David to\n[noise]\nGood morning [noise] so ah since Santa has out at our ah our humble beginnings [noise] uh let me just share I thought it might make sense to share a few more details about what actually happened in Nineteen Ninety six [noise]\nSo in Nineteen Ninety six or we had been classmates than I had called them up I had just a received a a job offer in San Francisco and I needed a place to stay\nAnd uh he said why don't you crush with me for a few days while you figure it out and so I visited him a in his humble home it was an efficiency in a building or that the newspapers at the time referred to as being managed by a slum lord\nAnd uh he said welcome to my humble bowed or I don't have a couch but there is a comfortable floor at the foot of my bed [noise]\nAnd every night for that week we were woken up or I was woken up because Sam have gotten\nUsed to it at that time by uh the sounds of not just their neighbors but a police officers coming into the building or to make arrests\nAnd I told him a few days in a semi I don't know how it is you managed to live here but rather we gotta move [noise] and at the time in Nineteen Ninety six\nNinety nine percent occupancy and ah we manage to find a place not too far away a on Russian hills those have you know my fair city of San Francisco a five of us ended up living in a an apartment that was built for three\nSam lived um and this was not a joke he literally lived in a closet where are the the floor foot square foot of the closet was about the size of the bed that he slept in about three feet by hotel you Sam [laughter] six six something it was about six feet four inches [noise]\nAnd ah it turns out that uh several years later the landlord of this particular building was charged with criminal negligence these are All Facts [noise] um I share this because\nThat was Nineteen Ninety six Ninety nine percent occupancy rate that was before dot com on point oh before dot com to point no\nBefore the highest home prices the highest rent the highest levels of homelessness the Heisman fiction rates the ten and crisis that we're experiencing not just in San Francisco and San jose in Silicon valley but the entire state of California and\nI share this ah because today two young men in their twenties who have an interest in coming to northern California to find their fortune to live their dreams just wouldn't be able to do it\nOkay you guys do know where you are rice\nI'm a little worried [laughter] I Know the traffic was bad but hopefully you guys ended up with the right place um we\n... of innovation that's transformed I Would say not just this country but it's transformed the world\nSo hopefully\nThat same technology has transformed healthcare right so what type of relationship status was technology in health care [noise] it's not good really it's not good\nSo if you to say about other industries in general technology not it's not always but in general technology has\nMade it easier it's made it less expensive it's made it more customized\nIt's often made it simpler I Would tell you that in general in healthcare\nTechnology has made it more expensive it's made it more complex\nAnd it's often made it more difficult actually for\nThose who work inside of health care to do their jobs now why why is that uh we had a great\nPanel I thought including or\nElected officials talking about the interplay of regulation\nAnd what they were trying to do in housing and in transportation we put technology in health care\nOn top of laws that were written not just before there were smart phones before there were a flip phone sometimes before there were computers we played technology on top of a culture\nThat is incredibly wedded to credentialing and licensure\nAnd we put it technology on top of a process\nThat gets at the very heart of what it means to be human and does it as a promise to make it absolutely better yes has done so to date no it really hasn't done so today but there are\nExceptions and there are things that could work and there are things that are working now so what are a few examples of things where it's actually made it better\nUm\nThis is a screen shot of a an app I have on my phone how many years in online\nApplication\nTo have access to your medical records I Would hope every hand in this room would go up really I don't know how any of us got on along without it I can both an appointment with my physician I can get my lab results I can get prescriptions refilled I can send a message\nTo my doctor All right thanks so is this game changing technology if you talk to our physicians they will tell you that this has changed everything if you talk to some patients they'll tell you this changed everything but is this new technology no\nIt's really not new technology this technology was around for a very long time before healthcare implemented it as a matter of fact I could track my UPS packages many years before I could trap my lab results here's another thing we think this\nGame changing and healthcare many of them is is now\nThan six years ago when my eldest daughter was applying to medical school and living in Switzerland we used ... to ...\nDaughter was applying to medical school and living in Switzerland we used to practice for her medical school interview six years later I should go on to her training she goes to a lecture that says video visits are they here to stay what what we do with this new technology it's pretty slow\nA wedding healthcare is really all about the people\nBut do we make it enough about the people\nDo we think about how our technology is actually going to interact with the people we serve and the people who served those people what are we can do about the chaos\nThat surround us for the most vulnerable among us let me tell you a story about this patient this is\nMichael Michael has gotten a lot of health care\nA lot of very expensive health care he ended up\nOur patient because he had recently been in another hospital and he was discharged with five different kinds of medication Michael left the hospital and took\nEvery pill and every bottle at once\nNow Michael did not do that because he was suicidal Michael did that because it could not read the instructions he was given\nHe was brought by ambulance to our emergency department where they saved his life more than that they took the time to talk to him to discover that the problem was that Michael needed a pair of reading glasses that you can get it a drug store to be able to read his discharge instructions\nWhich we happen to by actually from the dollar store in bulk so\nSometimes the solution is going to be a technological solution and sometimes the solution is going to be really about listening but it's all about what do we do to take the chaos that surrounds\nHealthcare and organize it instead around the patient that\nIs the promise of an integrated health care system\nThat integrated health care system might be built a system like set our house where we actually bring together physicians nurses other care providers hospitals ambulatory settings and home care it might be built in a virtual way depending on what community living and how that community is served\nBut you gotta bring those things together because the complexities is healthcare today is otherwise not going to work and has to be brought together in partnership in partnership with\nThe people from the panels we just heard because it's often about housing and it's often about transportation and it's often about social services and it's often about the environment\nAnd it's got to be brought together with the patient in the center because just like a marriage is not about the wedding it's really about two people falling in love and making a comment that\nTransformation of health care needs technology it's going to depend ON Technology but it's not going to be about technology is really going to be about health care and technology being supporting players so that we can do things with love and compassion for people who need us thank you\nYou're listening to a broadcast from the Silicon Valley leadership groups' annual game changers event held on September ... in Mountain View the last speaker was Sarah ... president and the IAU upset her health I'm Tania mostly\nOur final conversation tonight is moderated by Greg Becker president of Silicon Valley bank who introduced ... case the founder of AOL who now heads revolution a venture capital firm based in Washington DC here's Greg Becker [noise]\nThe morning you guys all filled with a good day for lunch everybody excited bill goes energy [noise]\nAll right um so it's great to be here I'm Steve and thanks for joining us or\nThe or when Carl and I were talking about who we could have is a keynote for a ... game changers event uh we immediately both tutors included in the having you a bigger is like the perfect example of being a game changer as\nWe were talking about a new direction you can look at what do you do this is the founder of AOL complete game changer\nWhat Steve his daughter revolution and really a game changer thinking about venture capital of entrepreneurship rise with the rest you're just a a great role model for that so thanks again for a for a beer [noise] um so I had the fortune of of being with Steve\nAnd his crew on the rise of the rest of books for the summer I went to a couple of cities are Dallas and er\nMemphis and I'm One of the questions I wanted to ask Steve gonna tear up\nUm this\nUm about one\nOf his partners someone else could show begins or how many of you guys have um read the book heard of the book a hillbilly elegy by Judy Vance\nRight while the vast majority of people here\nKnow how many people have read um the book or the third wave [laughter]\nAll right so\nA a I don't know maybe a third of of that so I'm Judy advances these partners my first question Steve how hard was it to bring in a partner was much better off than you were\nWorse with our book came out and bought the same ... years ago and his three hour or\nOne of the best sellers of the past you know doctors several more incompetence on mine but not nearly as well but\nYou so much greater pointed out to be with us so it made me feel bad about my my one it took me six years the right one book and hurting trashing Mars publishing\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature ban political science and into session will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Stanford ...\nThe third the third wave and why why it's important to you and why should why is it important to this audience\nWell first of all I should talk about the rise residence really promoting entrepreneurship outside of Silicon Valley\nI should say it's an honor to be here in Silicon valley at the computer history museum\nOr from the trucking industry well guess what\nMost of the big trucking companies are headquartered in Chattanooga\nSo if you like want to do as data system for the trucking industry those are like where the customers are those are people understand it kind of makes sense to be in\nIn in in in Chattanooga and some of the things that are happening in health care particularly health tech a lot of things coming out of Baltimore Johns Hopkins is based there underarm are rich doing a lot of things around you know kind of set this tax and so forth are based there is a lot of things happening there Cleveland because of the you know the the the Cleveland Clinic\nA lot of different parts of course things are happening\nHere and Stanford many other you know great places are are kind of sources of innovation but it's not just here it happening in these you know these other places so and in Michigan I'm\nProbably just back to the company that's doing a guy who simply space company in Traverse City Michigan a and there's another company we backed in Detroit and started lessons for years ago now is four hundred employees is doing\nTwo million dollars in revenue a day in downtown Detroit so he you know these things are happening it's just a story not being told most people don't think they're start ups in Detroit or Pittsburgh\nIn Detroit or Pittsburgh or or Indianapolis or other Indianapolis by the way up and you mentioned Indiana is a company their color jak target acquired by sales force for nearly three billion dollars\nYou know two thousand employees in Indianapolis second largest office outside of San Francisco for sales force is in Indianapolis most people think nothing's happening Indianapolis\nSo we're just trying to kind of tell that story and and get more people particularly the money here and I'm like [noise] it was Willie Sutton a\nBank bank robbery you when you when you brought the banks because that's where the money is a you know I feel a little bit like Willie Sutton line come to feel like we're trying to get people to understand there are many Robin ... that's a better and how do you have any kind of get the money to the rest of the ...\nOr you know the country and change though are you seeing more money I Know that's of low ... of revolution is to get more money there we've talked about other ways to get money those markets is that is that the biggest issue in those markets or do you see 'em let's talk about talent rights when you look at you know these cities right is it money talent and what else is missing it\nIs it's all about it you know the money is important because of the money is not there are people do\nLeave and then I come back so that was size on the talent that as you saw the show of hands on I learned you know the\nGreat innovators here are from other places and so how do you make sure they yeah they again it just a great place to be people want to be here they shouldn't be here or ... you know they shouldn't feel like they have to be here to be able to do something that's part of the sort of innovation\nOr economy so challenging some of these places are just one of the things that Silicon Valley does so great is there's a sense of ... year like anything is possible sometimes like maybe a little crazy and maybe comes off a little bit arrogant but\nThat's a good thing that you know that anything is possible\nMentality in many parts of the country they're kinda cautious kind of risk averse job you know moral you know\nMuch that's going to work you know it's so so that that's that cultural aspect is important so I'm not saying that aren't challenges there's the money's there nine of talent or not enough fearlessness there's not enough kind of activity there's a lot of network density here where people are now you know connected sometimes again you know maybe to an extreme but but you know there are parts of the\nYou know the country we lack that kind of network you know density so this is a long haul a government goes back to my you know experience with a\nA wall in those early days of the Internet will now seems obvious\nFor a decade nobody was paying attention to what we're doing\nMost people did not believe there is a reason to get on line there's like\nYou really think people are going to like sit at a\nKeyboard like ... message to somebody and they can just pick up the phone just doesn't seem like it the mainstream phenomenon and we laughed about it but when we went public in Nineteen eighty two first in our company goes public we'd been at it for almost a decade we had two hundred thousand customers\nA decade later I was like thirty million customers so it was slow most people didn't believe it you know the ... most people are skeptical morning I get calls from my parents and like [noise]\nLike we love me and all but I Know you're kind of passionate about this thing but it\nDoesn't seem to be working [laughter] be like a plan beer and there's no I really think so and I I I see the similar skepticism I talked about the rise lot of smart people living here that I Know and respect what can be like okay I think he's well meaning\nBut but wrong he's he's not going to happen the rest not going to rise a but we think it will and frankly where they can to otherwise you know this divide this country between you know kind of people who said before who\nFeel like the future is going to be good for them and their families and their communities versus bad for them is going to grow and that's going to relieve a lot of really bad stuff so we need to figure out ways to have a more inclusive approach to\nInnovation and although a lot of that is focused on place the other you know points that I think are worth pointing out that if you look at the venture capital data from the MDC aid from last year\nLess than ten percent of venture capital when it's over Ninety percent went to men less than one percent went to African Americans so\nWe are great on the nation's which should be proud of that and Silicon Valley is the epicenter that and\nWe should be proud of it but if you look at the data it does suggest it does matter where you live [noise] doesn't matter what you look like\nDoes matter who you know but if you have an idea\nYou have a shot at turning into a company in ... shot at the American dream and that's not right and that's not smart we need to figure out a way to kind of a level playing field and and anything any of you can do to help would be greatly appreciate it\nI think it's great what you've done and again the cities that I visited with you um the the quality of companies the diversity of companies um that you're supporting is is truly amazing question about you're talking to Indianapolis and you and I both know Scott a do receive from the exact targets\nSo that was a big win selling three point eight billion dollars to sales force and that's um a helping you didn't apple is do you think cities need\nBig home runs to get a kind of create that you could system so you got to do with security in Ann Arbor um sold for more than a billion dollars recently due to cities need big outcomes to really transforming to really get on the map for do you think it can be a lot of singles doubles that will\nAllow that can be but clearly the home runs or helpful it is it it it gets people's attention and the capital of some of which stays in the community because of the employees in some of the local office\nOften angel investors will simply redeploy that money Scott as an example and started after snowing or the sales force started a a firm that's basically\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and into session will be held on Monday October fifteenth MLA Dutch Stanford ...\nHaving a great university super helpful\nA there's a bunch of things are a super helpful but if you don't have that you still can make a go of that and and you know is that what we're trying to do is figure out in each of these communities what what's the next chapter for that region\nIn terms of building on its core strengths and trying to figure out where where it can really a kind of play a role in this in this next set of race the other the other question that God is one of the you know the panelists from the\nLast healthcare session was from from ethic ethic as you may not know which is one of those are the leading maybe one pot on the top three health technology companies in the country\nIs not from here in Madison, Wisconsin I think it was like ten thousand employees now for African Madison, Wisconsin so it's just another example\nOf of of this sort of dispersion of innovation or that we think will accelerate in this in this third way\nAs part of the tax um law that got passed a last year one of the things they critiqued economic zones ever investment\nOn notice there's eight thousand seven hundred small economic zones around the United states most of them are in really impoverished areas or or areas that don't have access to the dry I'm a more investment there by lowering taxes for people that invested right now\nIs that are you seeing that stimulate it or is it not really having impact in\nYou know it's a little early ... I was a fan of that ... it's\nCalled investing and opportunity act was introduced about three years ago and a bipartisan way by young Cory Booker and Tim Scott and the Senate had broad support in both the Senate and the house and then got integrated into the tax reform bill that passed you know seven or eight months ago\nA and so I took a few months for the you know some of the rules to be run took a few months for the governor's ... states have to identify which are these opportunities owns that they would they would basically have these tax advantages\nAnd in capitals still isn't a process of\nBeing you know kind of coming together around these ideas but there are definitely a bunch of people are looking at opportunities sons whether it be to invest and start out certain Dustin in in real estate or other kinds of things I think it will be super helpful it's gotten people you know kind of saying what what are your what what what's going on there and\nAnd you know the tech capital gains a kind of benefit to a pretty significant into that will result in people paying attention to opportunities or otherwise you weren't paying attention to and\nAnd that will hopefully accelerate this uh this uh this flow of capital\nIt's such a benefit if in fact could you hold the investment for ten years I Know it's a long time the taxes are actually zero on the gains that you have on those investments so they really are trying to stimulate it I'm", "show_name": "It's Your World", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "04"}
