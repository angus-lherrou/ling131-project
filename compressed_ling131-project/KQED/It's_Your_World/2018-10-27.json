general please welcome Mr Juan Williams\n[noise] [noise]\nSo we have a diplomat you know you be thinking about your questions you can sum it up here to ask Mr Williams and I'll just sort of get us started but I really wanted to just give him an opportunity to sort of just give us a\nA synopsis of the book from the outset in his own words as to what sort of motivated him and and what I'm all went into play when he thought about this book the writing of it um and just sort of the whole engagement with his mistakes as compared to maybe other books that you've written\nA professor Taylor it's a pleasure to have you with me in pleasure to be here at the commonwealth club thanks to all of you for coming out this\nAfternoon [noise] this is a a tricky subject because racist so waited in our society for so many centuries not just in the current ah look\nBut the reality is that we are at a critical moment so normally for me\nTo answer to an answer to your question professor I had it been a tremendously interested in the history of civil rights in the United states\nIn the bigger the people who have been central to promoting social change on the most difficult issue of race\nOr I've written a biography of Justice Marshall ...\nOff you look back at eyes on their prize you can see that I Am very interested in people who were change agents\nIn this society so I'm Talking about\nPeople like you know Chaney Goodman and Schwerner going down south and Freedom Summer Nineteen sixty four who are these people who put themselves at risk for the greater good and in that case become martyrs to the car but in this moment\nI don't think there's much question that if you look at where we are as Americans with regard to race you'd say you know in the words of Charles Dickens that was the best of times and it was the worst of times\nIn the sense that it's the best of times you know in my life time just ten years ago we saw the election of a black president a black man is president United States in my lifetime\nWe've seen the first black billionaire we've seen people emerge or in terms of the coach from ... in a way that unimaginable people from Michael Jackson to Kendrick Lamar uh we've seen people from\nSponsorship that they can't really do you live stream science than any firm Comcast extending the Internet to present home life high for ultimately in the home\nYou know we've seen the first chair of the joint chiefs of staff the first secretary of state African Americans it's I could keep going in this way it's really been an incredible period a tremendous gains\nAnd most of all maybe the gain in terms of the black middle class in this country and the gain in terms of black political power\nRight now we have a record number of black people serving in the U.S Congress record number of women serving in the U.S Congress so we've seen tremendous progress but at the same time when you ask people today\nAbout the current state of race relations in the country right now people say that worse race relations are worse than they've ever been right now half of the American people forty nine percent say the president is a racist including eleven percent of Republicans\nSo you've come to think what what has happened how could it be that we have such tremendous progress such tremendous growth in terms of the black middle class black political voice black political opportunity record numbers of graduates from high school and college\nAnd yet people think race relations are going down there too I think you and I both know the answer has to do with the rise of Donald Trump Trump who comes on the political scene with the birther movement saying that the first black president wasn't even an American that he's an illegitimate president\nSome kind of Machiavellian candidate Donald Trump who then comes down to the golden escalator at Trump Tower and begins calling Mexicans rapists and criminals Donald Trump to goes on in terms of the kind of rhetoric that he uses to\nTalk about a black woman as a dog\nTo talk about NFL players who Neal in protest the police brutality during the anthem as s obese who should be fired\nA Donald Trump who says at one point that are an American born judge a Mexican parents cannot be fair to him can't do his job causing the speaker of the house Republican Paul Ryan to say that was the epitome of a racist statement\nThis is Donald Trump\nAnd he has successfully appealed\nTo white anger and fear in this society\nEven as the society is becoming more diverse and especially as we've seen an increase in the number of immigrants so he has become a force of the vision racial division ... division in terms of class in terms of so many\nAh point subdivision in this society he has been willing to exploit for political advantage\nSo I'll stop there but it's the same time you you ground his own\nOrientation in the anti she'd party of of the Republican Party itself and that you kind of outlined the ways in which there he's not the first one and he sort of not an outlier maybe in terms of lack of the courtroom but in terms of the substance of his ideas you put him along the continuum of\nApollo there is a continuing to be but what you have to understand is that since the sixties since the passage of the sixty four civil rights act since the passage of the sixty five voting rights act as you know at that point President Johnson says we've lost the south now for a generation like the\nSouth went from being mostly democratic to mostly Republican in the aftermath of those moves and we know that President Nixon played to a southern strategy with just that in mind we know that someone like President Reagan opened his campaign by going down to Mississippi gr\nAh and going to the show the county fair or the county where Goodman Chaney Goodman Schwerner were killed\nA and people had lots of questions and we know\nAre going forward from that that there have been issues with the Republican Party as becoming more and more white\nEven as the country became more and more racially diverse but Trump has played this a in a way that I think is distinct professor even from other Republicans I think most Republicans would have no trouble saying go going back to\nYou know Eisenhower and pushing away are so many of the race is a bad period President Eisenhower sending a hundred and first airborne to Little Rock Arkansas are pushing away the John birth society making it clear\nPilloried go water for his racial attitudes around the civil rights so that's why I was just a friendly kind of your quest looking I'm like OK\nOkay um so this question is do you find it difficult to talk about race relations while Trump is in office while you're working on Fox News [laughter] [noise]\nI can tell you I I think if this was that a different kind of artist I rip off my shirt his show you show your cars you know\nBecause it's so difficult to have\nMeaningful conversations about race\nEspecially with my colleagues at five and I mean the good thing about Fox's that I'm there there's a number one cable channel in America\nAnd it's an opportunity I think to pierce the bubble in to say hey there's a different perspective and a different experience of life and here it is to to me I'm In the arena on a daily basis and and so the attitudes and the\nQuestions that I have to cope with and the kind of on slot because I'm the exception not part of the mainstream right it can be heavy\nBut it's just a different reaction when you're in Studio there is one phenomena that happens to you but when you go out the door\nAnd it's a whole nother reality in terms of how people the CD logically I think it was saying that he was saying that sort of when you out of the studio that oh you mean like a representative of the sort of liberal left perspective in in in in Studio if I'm not mistaken\nFor no I I mean obviously if I'm Talking to Sean Hannity or not I'm not that kind of heat conservative right right so you must be the liberal could things that comes out of Iraq but it's like that I just give you that as an extreme example but I mean what you ... you know in my life\nI think people have often tried to pigeon hole me are you left right you right in right now where do you fit in there and that was my question to end in in in so many areas you know it just becomes a question because I say you know what I think their policies that have not been productive I think we need to for example I wrote a book called enough\n... which was about the failures of black leadership in this time you know black leadership not\nGoing after critical issues like why do we have a community is the devil by drug dealers want we aren't there protesting the drug dealers\nOr why aren't we going after the problem of poor quality schools why don't we more aggressive and saying these schools are not serving our company's best interest as opposed to seeing them as simply providing jobs again oftentimes in the black community but failing the black children and I think\nThat's that's short term mhm a short sighted thinking oh you know so\nOn so many levels I'm willing to question the leadership and then people say well that means you must be conservative no I'm just trying to tell you\nI think we have to hold political leaders to account black white Asian Latino if they're not serving the community call 'em out but again that's more outside the studio but at the studio where I work for ... I Am position then and posturing there as the lessons\nButtons on the questions related says I Love you on the fire but how do you prepare for the\nSponsorship of the ... science than any firm Comcast extending the Internet to present home life high for ultimately in the home\nAnd I and I fast\nForward through most of the things you see 'em a role playing a role or is he just and immature resentful person\n[laughter] wild tested I have a chance to come speak to this out and found it very interesting\nNo I I think again Jesse represents\nA point of view and finds that\nFor him there are people who are big supporters and people who find his ah his kind of presentation entertaining and it becomes entertainment but I think it's entertainment that sometimes it's at a cost and a two perceptions of common destiny and common interest and common commonality as American\nRelated question Mr Williams how do you maintain your civility working with your colleagues that Fox News who consistently support an echo actions in words of such despicable and a legitimate or a ... a despicable and they're legitimate president [laughter]\nWell again I have to cope\nWith the idea that so many of my colleagues are in fact on the Trump bandwagon a and I'm willing to challenge it and speak out against it and again in my hat's off\nTo the idea that I'm there and the audience for the most part likes me so that's that you know that that's a shock in some ways\nAnd [noise]\nAnd that question do you think things are free [noise] ah do you\nThink African Americans should join with Latinos Hispanics et cetera road to be a bigger voting bloc and how do you get participation significantly higher\nWell I think that what you have to do is make it seem urgent mhm ah and if people have to see that it's directly impacts their lives now we're coming up on these midterm elections and historically minority communities\nEducating people and Democrats do not turn out in high numbers mhm but I think that because this has become something of a referendum on Trump and because of Trump's behavior including a lot of his racist they have\nI think there is a sense of urgency and I think you're going to see a larger turnout in them in terms of the consequences\nSo this is all about your life my life\nOur communities our family\nAnd when people feel that politics makes a difference I think you see them\nBecome activated too often they felt you know what it doesn't make a difference that you know the Democrats might take you for granted a and the Republicans might ignore you but what we have now is a situation where people feel that they are being demonized and belittle\nOr and hopefully that does create a common set of issues that drive them to the polls\nYou write with a sense sense of urgency that was the question was going to ask you this book is written with a sense of urgency\nAnd I you know I've been around you know the last thirty forty years listening to people talk about this concept of race war\nAnd nobody takes as I've been taking it seriously when you sit down and out in ... I'm Steve Miller in the in the White House um do you take the concept of race war seriously at all I don't know what what you mean the idea that there was this project and I think it was ... when I see\nThat are written a book called the coming race ... this whole idea that race war is coming and with the president sort of you know\nSlap fanning the flames that you're sayings ... of fanning do you take that concept that ... we're going to Balkan either as a society with these racial divisions in terms of violence\nOr no I don't think that's coming I think that you have episodes where there's racial violence in the country and people act out or it can be somebody uh you know in terms of\nWe see it with all too frequent a ... regular without too much regularity of you know the police shooting somebody and saying why didn't you shooting setter in fear of black men and all the rest coming to the forefront but no I think that the nation is on a different track professor which is that we're becoming more diverse and\nA and in my lifetime or\nYou know I like in the book I say you know Trump is Seventy two I'm sixty four\nYou know eight years different but we've lived through this tremendous change in America but he seems to have missed one I saw happening right right and the growth in the black middle class for example to me\nIs the most important thing that's happened in my life not right right I mean to compare in my life and my father as I say in the fact that if\nYou know my father lived in in his life was defined by his race in terms of where he lived as a neighborhood in terms of his jobs right but for me or you know if he saw me living in an integrated neighborhood if\nHe said you know what you work and have contracts with major American media white owned media you write books for white publishers\nA you know if he saw that his granddaughter my daughter was a graduate of Georgetown University law school and it didn't accept black people until the late sixties\nThat's a different world and if he saw me at the White House having lunch\nAnd then saw that the other guy sitting there was a black man and realize that he's President Obama say oh my God different unit for that I Can't imagine that my dad would say right so you stop and think about these things that have happened\nIn our lifetime but also in Trump's lifetimes what an amazing thing forty percent of black America earning between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars in additional twelve percent earning between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nThat means more than half of black America is either on the edge of being middle class or solidly in it and beyond it mhm\nBut he doesn't plug into that notion of people have sacrificed people have been in the vineyards working hard to allow this to her instead he focuses I think quite intentionally on the dysfunction that chaos and poor black communities and use\n... on the dysfunction the chaos and poor black communities and uses that to serve beer and division in the white community\nBut to your point remember it's the case that black or about Thirteen percent of the population is one of the another big change in my lifetime has been that Latinos are now a larger group ... sixteen Seventeen percent of the population Asian\nThe fastest growing segment of that minority population seven to eight percent\nSo you start to see that the country is on track to become more diverse more of a multi cultural experience in the United states and what Trump is doing I think like with the make America great again hats\nHe's harkening back in time when there was a very\nThe whole notion of blacks were happy to be to live in segregated lesser lives right women were happy to remain in their place and\nWell as I said earlier to me I think that Fox as such a major platform in American media the number one cable news station in the country\nOr is unimportant venue to have somebody come in and ... burst the bubble I have someone come in and offer\nA different set of perspectives in fact and so I find myself challenging so many of their top personalities and I'm I'm there every day mhm uh and no one is telling me what to say so to me this is an opportunity it comes at a tremendous cost 'cause I feel beat up much of the time I feel like oh my God you're not hearing\nBut it's not the case that I Am not in fact saying what I Want to saying and trying to reach and it's very interesting to pick up on that point I meant and ... I mentioned in passing earlier than\nThat there's so much oftentimes positive response from people that people will say to me at a ball game and the airport and the trains whatever they will say to me you know I don't agree with your politics but I like you and I like the fact that you're there you know when I go to the ...\nSponsorship of the ... science Cindy from Comcast extending the Internet to present home life high for ultimately in the home\nThe argument and so I'm performing a function there as a foil but I think also as a a source of a different\nPerspective [noise] um this is a kind of a funny one it says you used to be six for you take such a pounding every night on fire [laughter]\nUm let's see uh there's a what would you have again that was the repeated when do you think former President Obama was a pot was a net positive for or for race relations\nHe famously believe he was ten to Twenty years too early Obama well I think Obama was a net positive for race relations\nOh I Do uh I think you know looking back on the Obama presidency boy you know I see people in tee shirts that simply said the miss me now\nAnd I think that that's very rare what a contrast in terms of uh you know a class that lack of scandal yeah and all the rest I mean I Can't imagine if President Obama had been involved with a porn star has been you know\nPaying off people lying is his first national security advisor or had pled guilty\nHis campaign manager I think I think he would be long be gone you know I think he will not eat he\nNominally have the scandal that we see ... I just I just don't think there's any point of comparison but it's quite it's related to this obviously political pressure negative media attention don't change Trump's mind or behavior so what we'll do you think he will win a second term what will change Trump and we'll win again\nOkay I think the two separate issues one is I don't think there's any changing the Seventy two year old man and a who tells people he's a stable genius\n[laughter] so [noise] I I I leave it alone\nAnd I don't I don't I think we've gone past that point they say you can only change people when they're in diapers and I think that definitely applies the\nTrump [noise] um [noise] as to whether he might win re election well his numbers are just terrible even now um and they creep up at times and there were some good news for the Republicans this week in terms of\nApproval of the party was I think at forty seven just like slightly above the Democrats have forty six in one Gallup poll but if you look at for example\nA generic party preference when it comes to this election Democrats haven't been able to pull away but they still maintain a strong a margin advantage end when it comes to engagement in energy among the voting base\nDemocrats really have a strong advantage going into these midterms so when it comes to the twenty twenty race\nI think it'll have to do with who the Democrats are able to nominate and exactly how you engage Trump because I think that's very difficult as we saw in the Republican primaries if you try to say hey this guy knows very little\nThis guy you know as someone who says outrageous things cause people names et cetera or it's not not necessarily effective with his base so his base\nIs likely to nominate him again I don't know if John Kades sake or whoever on the Republican side might hold out and challenge him and I think that's possible but I don't see that person prevailing\nBut once it comes to a general election I think if the Democrats have someone who's able to not only take on Trump but to contrast offer contrast in terms of political stability mhm\nAnd political experience to Trump and I I think I think Trump's in big trouble mhm\nYeah wow that's that's I think that's news\nUm [noise] what is your perspective on rising you said a smoke a little bit about it but what is your perspective on rising social economic inequality increase housing education health care costs and its impact on the future of minority middle class groups your opinion and also they want to know how related to that how you feel about Bernie Bernie Sanders\nWell I think that let's deal with the first part in the rising income inequality and how it impacts minorities in the country remember as I was saying the earlier you have for the first time in American society a sizable black middle class\nThis to me is a tremendous achieve and I think the two major achievements of the civil rights movement one is that economic stability but secondly would be political voice and\nUm and we touched on that with ... with Obama but also a record number of blacks in Congress and the like\nBlack mayors are right now you have the possibility of a black governor or in Florida in Georgia\nTo Maine Maryland right you know these are amazing things so I mean this is again part of the growth and I think you know I don't see how you hold back that wave of change that sleeping America\nIt's almost like Trump is happening up here but there's something else going on with women and with minorities electorally are across the country well I mean\nWouldn't I wouldn't exclude whites I think educated whites I think people you know and after the failure of the Trump tax cuts yeah I think there are people who are working class whites who say you know I don't I don't see it I don't know what's going to again that that plays into what's going on in the midterms\nBut you asked about how this impacts then the black middle class like well I think that if you look at it the question is how\nI think the question that would come from the black community to any president what are you doing\nTo help that black middle class growth and in particular in particular to overcome the wealth gap so that even as you have a stronger black middle class than ever before they remains a tremendous differential in terms of the wealth in terms of\nPeople buying houses stock dividends property investments\nThat attends a attaches to the white community and its absent in the black community\nMeant that attends a\nAttaches to the white community and its absent in the black community so it's more the kind of paycheck to paycheck and people coming along slowly\nThat is the big difference in what I get to reiterate Trump is taking away some of those government supports that were put in place to encourage entrepreneurship to encourage or the growth of that black middle class one other point on their says\nWhen Trump comes in and says he's going to drain the swamp you starts cutting government\nRemember Bush comes in Obama comes in and they are repositioning reforming government but at the same time you see small increments and government for minorities disproportionate share of minorities working\nFor government state local but also federal government I think it's like thirty three percent more of a likelihood for minority ... because a biased in the private sector difficulties\nIn private sector employment mhm so when he's whacking at this when he's freezing payments for government workers when he's taking away tax base from local and state government he\nIs impacting that black and Latino middle class in a very real way\nMhm mhm [noise] um this is another question during the Clarence Thomas\nI forgot one thing was about Bernie Sanders yeah how do you feel about Bernie thank you and again I think Sanders it's so interesting there's a real commonality if you look at the numbers between so many Trump voters and Sanders voters they're populous yeah and they want someone thing of disruption in terms of American politics\nUm but again the difference is that for the Sanders\nVoters they see government as having a role and they do not believe that simply by giving more to the rich\nThat you're going to solve these problems like Elizabeth Warren and the consumer financial protection born you know\nSome comes in and he wants to do away with that in the argument that he would make is that since overregulation burdensome on business\nWarren and Sanders make the case you know what we see is big business in fact exploiting mhm taking advantage of people who are hard working Americans of all colors um and I think that's where the divide comes between the Sanders\nAnd the Trump a voting base but make no mistake about it there's populist energy that I think is rebelling against the idea of the establishment and especially the upper income establishment as looking out for themselves and their children's at the expense of the rest of the country\nAnd we'll send so we have like Fifteen minutes left Africa the early ... I'm going to try my best friend is I Can't Clarence Thomas hearings are reportedly supported Thomas's position that he was a victim of a high tech Clinton today Lindsey Graham spoke about Brett\nKavanaugh as a victim do you think Kevin ... is the victim of a conspiracy to smear him\nNo [noise]\n[noise]\nAh this is related to that you've you've already answered the question a T O M that's inappropriate or the black community and especially black women the black you didn't have to off yeah sometimes you have to use your discretion as a person reading these things are the black community at especially black women often makes a difference in elections", "show_name": "It's Your World", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "27"}
