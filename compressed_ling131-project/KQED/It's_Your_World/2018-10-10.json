Bush and I wanted to kinda see what the religious right was doing ... now obviously liberty is like you know Trump gave the commencement address there last year it's become sort of a big um Republican or operative machine\nUm but back then it was still run by the senior Jerry Falwell\nMachine um but back then it was still run by the senior Jerry Falwell um who's since died and it was it was a bizarre and and sort of wild experience of being not only like going to classes there but living in the dorms and singing and the church choir and things like that\nAnd how undercover where you people know that you were writing a book\nNo no I I transferred there as if I was like you know just a student and I I I went to to brown which is sort of like the opposite of of\nThe book was all like from from from brown to liberty yeah it ... it was like I'm actually they had a very funny reaction to the liberty 'cause like I was sitting\nThere the where'd you come from and I would say I would say you know I went to brown and they and they said my God I'm so sorry\n[laughter] it must be awful there how do you how did you do that this seemed I was like an evangelical\nTrapped um [laughter] so we had fun in a liberal you want you to college with pastel grid yeah um do you go to brown too I did ... [noise]\nI'm In San Francisco do I really schools are listed applause [laughter]\nYes yes [laughter] um [laughter]\nI don't feel it starts to feel the me going back and looking at your resume that at the idea of ... of of putting yourself in a sort of ... to you at least an exotic\nWorld and just kind of bearing herself into is you're calling card and the most recent version of that as as listeners they only know has been immersing yourself profoundly in leaving the darkest corners of the weather I mean as you said you're a beat is kind of prefer perversion of of the Internet\nYou know I'm I'm interested in extremes I'm interested in people who choose to live very differently than I Do and um and part of what we've seen happen over the past several years is that the Internet and social media has has really given voice to extremist and I'm I'm very interested in how that happens\nAnd what kinds of things that used to do and where they congregate so I'm I have you know every day I wake up and I turned on my computer and I I have like a whole running list of like awful for Chan a sub more than reading threads that I check and then I you know to check my email after that [laughter]\nAfter you take a job that is I mean I wasn't even why we put together this particular cast of characters on stage and it's because we're very much wanted to explain the essential elements of what it is\nTo make the daily and so here on stage tonight you have the like three ... atomic elements of the show you have your dashing host may [noise]\nUm you have [noise]\nUm\nYou have your ... your intrepid undercover reporter and you have your brilliance behind the scenes producer any brown [noise]\nAnd and and forget that we're going to draw back the curtain on on of course the tech industry but also how ... how we make the daily and the reality is that when you drop back\nThe curtain on the daily it's not always so perfect and highly produced or even pretty and I say that because you may remember this if you listen to the first couple of weeks on the show I don't come from the world the body I don't I have no experience in the world of audio\n... in reality I Do not deserve to be an audio host I did not come from this world I Am not one of you\nAnd um and when the show started I encountered a tremendous my difficulty actually just doing the work of of being an audio host my voice was much higher than it is now we can talk about how that changed um\nAnd I do read audio ... yeah that's what I call it um and and I\nGenuinely struggle with just the basics of like saying we'll be called the billboard of the top of the show from the New York times and today and the ... and all that stuff and and I I could not do it and we would be in the studio for hours yeah trying to make it work [noise]\nIt's like yeah it's just so normally I didn't think that would be a joke that that [laughter] there's a there's kind of a story that became kind of like took on mythic quality is on the team whenever someone would joined the team is the ... of the night before the daily launched and all the producers were packed in the studio with Michael and we spent\nAn hour trying to get him to say the gate with enough ... set it\nCould it could it could launch the daily and it would feel like we were taking on this moment with enough ... and we and we spend an hour just each producer at trying their hand at at coaching hand like\nJust below words slower\nWould say like oh God those guys are so embarrassing like they're these boomers with their friends and their robes and they're just like so cringe worthy [noise]\n\nSo they were sort of advocating for the more I turn around what role does does this word\nPlay in the actual unite the Right rally and ultimately I guess the violence that occurred I mean how directly do you feel like a site like this conversation is like those that you're listening to and we just heard and a contributing to what happens there wasn't\nAny space where people are able to gather in sort of semi private or private area is it going to be prone to this I mean there's not I don't think this is this court's fault\n'em but I think after the after our story ran after the the podcast came out they did to crack down on these guys and and ban a lot of the biggest for clusters of extremists from the server since then you know it's more popped up but they're keeping a closer eye on it now and you ended up interviewing\nPeople in this group in this disorder but\nYeah I I called up a couple of the members and and one in particular was sort of one of the leaders of this group is one of the organizers of the rally and he's a big Internet I'm All right presence and um yeah we had a very interesting conversation\nI Want to play this clip of you're talking to this white nationalist because I think it does something really important in explaining why we created the daily and why the show is what it is which is\nIt creates a real transparency around reporting and storytelling and one of the things we don't talk about on the show is kind of how much the show is guided by what happened in the presidential election and the feeling that a lot of us had enough you know I definitely had it that\nA journalism and kind of failed us in twenty sixteen and that we had arrived at a point where\nReaders justify Li like didn't understand how we were getting our information and so little misled about the conclusions that that they have drawn because of the reporting we did and and the daily all about letting listeners really understand how journalism happens\nWhat it's like to be on the phone with somebody what it's like when Dianne Feinstein answers the phone or in this case a white nationalist interrogate you and and I want to say that because I think it helps people understand what journalism actually sounds like\nOh you want to ask you a question you sort of stopped and said well can I ask you a question for the personal\n[noise] what race are you a\n... you've seen my profile as you look Hispanic to me is that oh you're white and Jewish is a question [noise]\n\nWell if you're white than a than a few years there'll be part of that's great [laughter] [noise] okay All right [laughter] I have a good day\nI mean he's ... he's basically trying to be you and just saying something ... and this is like the kind of story that\nHe's basically trying to beat you and just saying something ... and\nThis is like the kind of story that would never that that would never make it into a print version probably but that we would I Would tell them you know my colleagues at the bar or that would come up in conversation I I Love that about\nIt sort of what the reporter's notebook element of the day and that's what's so fun is like we get to write a story for the paper and then bring all of the kind of extra material in and make it you know come alive in audio\nAnd we only have this clip because\nHe was actually recordings you so I think it's important to understand that it wasn't like you were recording this conversation necessarily fear it I think you were doing some kind of fact checking with him in this conversation he records that and then she uploads it on to you too as a kind of like gotcha moment\nAnd I this is sort of crazy to me that like you are in in your regular reporting life\nAre find yourself in these kinds of there'll be tracks where your sources are trying to catch ill or or like corner you said that you say something that could potentially be damning for your career\nYeah and I always have to be on the lookout for that I mean are there are a lot of people with strong feelings about the New York times positively or negatively and we've we've learned that you know there are people who will try to plant false stories who will try to trick us we'll try to catch us doing something um so it's just it just makes you more cautious as a reporter I think\nI Wonder how much time you spend thinking about\nThe dangers of amplifying this kind of journalism I mean you send your day in this world and then you write about it and then you come on a daily and we're all collectively putting a lot of energy and time in front and audio into essentially given these people may be a bigger platform and I wonder how you grapple with that\nYeah it's something that I think about a lot and I obviously you know we don't want to be a megaphone for people with extreme or sort of dangerous views on the other hand I'm\nAs with this court\nLike a lot of times are reporting on this is the thing that brings the existence of these communities into people's awareness\nAnd in some cases actually leave the platforms themselves to kind of crack down on them so even though we may be amplifying like one specific set of people\nIt can lead to a major overhaul and changes at these platforms which can then sort of like\nIt'd be a net good more the quality of the conversation but I also think like that's kind of I when I get to watch a lot like how can you amplify things like Q A non or um things that might remain on the fringes\nAnd I guess my answer is that these people have platforms I mean there there are people like Alex Jones and others\nHave enormous Internet platforms they they sort of um you know sometimes they're bigger than ours and so I think in that case we can sort of services like a translator or a corrective interest explaining to people sort of what's happening who's involved and what um what's the nature of the conversation about how\nHow much does a sites like Facebook Twitter you to\nHow much of a rule that they play in taking what you are experiencing underscored and letting it run at all free on their website well this is sort of like how\nMisinformation and hate speech and sort of extremist content moved through the Internet is like sort of a well established\nPath for those who like you know this corridor for channel that goes to read it and that goes to put her and then it goes to Facebook and YouTube\nUm so that's pretty familiar I think that ... right now what some of these companies are grappling with this kind of like how do we interrupt that chain or like how do we make it so that this stuff doesn't I'm getting millions of eyeballs on it but it's hard right like these people are crafty if you shut them down one place they moved to another place\nI'm with a different name so a lot of these servers that that got deleted from discord after Charlottesville are now back up with with other names\nUm and if your platform is kind of like a whack a mole game it's it's pretty much sort of it's hard to win where are these guys now [noise]\nUm they some of them are are still underscored they've also moved into um groups on what's up they've moved into um they moved on to read it they're they're sort of spread out a little more than they used to be outside of centralized where you have you know five thousand people in one group but they have sort of smaller\nPockets of that and one of the things you've done so well in the daily is explain how much accountability or non accountability has occurred when it comes to the big social media companies that have been number comes from both burden by this\nAnd in some people's minds complicit in its amplification so you have kind of made a sub beat\nIt and your job of explaining to the world what\nFacebook especially has been doing when it comes to this and\nMy favorite episodes of the daily and I never expected\nThem to be even listen I'm all\nFor the congressional hearings evolving or soccer\nYeah those are fun to watch that I don't even watch all five hours of it but you know people don't\nWatch congressional hearings like I was like I I'm not a I Would not news that for the daily and you I wouldn't have dreamed of wanting to watch a congressional hearing and I think one of the things that it's so powerful that that you as a as a narrator on the daily is that\nYou can make it fun in a way that like I'm sort of I I can be can be tricked into watch into watching a congressional hearing [noise] and and and and this hearing to see how the context as if you remember what happened was they took it was going to be that\nThis moment where we are going to have a we were going to have Congress really holding Facebook account\nWe were going to have a we were going to have Congress really holding Facebook accountable for what happened\nWell it's sort of what happened in the election and in Cambridge Analytica but the but this moment where they they could really they could ask Mark Zuckerberg anything and it was going to and like we're all sort of waiting to see what it would be and you as a narrator it was so fun 'cause we saw\nI'll just let you hang in there for you consider my personal you're doing a ... day it on the company to not mind is that if [noise]\nNo senator actually that's the first line of our terms of service say that you control and own the information and content that you put on Facebook\nAnd so it sounds a little like a five hour tech support call [laughter]\nIt's like trying to explain to someone very patiently how their iPhone [laughter]\nTo turn the dial on on sort of that kind of viral content they actually having a little bit harder time these days getting the kind of audience that they once had and they're starting to experiment with other types of stories\nUm 'cause the the outrage machine doesn't work as quite as well as it used to\n... I'm Kevin this has been a very serious discussion it's been kind of having most daily discussions are kind of heavy ... and I think before we even think about\nTurning to our saviors in the audience for you and I we want to have lightened things up just to touch\nToday we want to have lightened things up just a touch that's\nOne of the things about making a new show with a new host who hasn't been an audio is that you learn their verbal check and as I'm sure you all know Michael Barbara has a pretty recognizable purple tech\n... [noise]\nIt comes in many forms it's a it's quite polarizing people feel many different ways about it you guys get like a lot of emails about the ... yeah [noise]\nWe do we get at least one or two a week yeah about the ... I have a pretty\nI have a somewhat of noxious reply to the people who don't like it would you like H M\nM M M M [noise]\nIt's not just at the producer that you can email every time I did it feels like you're saying the same joke over and over again\nSo we're so should you should sell as a ring tone though like you know [laughter]\nSo what's interesting about it and it's like oh you you're going to do it and why this weird take I have well let's talk about why I actually do\nRight which is um when you're a journalist and you're on the phone with somebody and they're they're just sort of drawing on and on or the wonderful thing there aren't that many ways of affirming them or making them think you're still listening\nAnd you can do a lot of things without agreeing with things you can do the dishes you can do I mean you can go off and do a lot of things it's it's really more about ... ... you can get on with your mother\n... [laughter]\nReally or about the fact that it's about it's about the fact that you can be talking to someone that you don't agree with you and they can be saying something that you don't want to affirm but you want to say I hear\nYou and you want the audience you know that you're still there and the and I think a lot of say right yeah yeah and when we talk to people but saying that sounds like you're especially to white nationalist do I sound like you're affirming them I ... I feel very firm\nPersonally when I go on that when I go to the daily I mean it's like I spent an hour the guys you making found very large just an hour yeah and and and I get a lot of affirming ... and I feel like I honestly I should be like a paying your co pay for the [laughter]\nIt's a good experience I I Hope everyone in this room someday has a chance to be affirmed by these guys [noise]\nOver ... there was something that any brown you may have yet to them yes and we're wondering if anyone's birthday tonight there were those\nYesterday that's pretty good okay this one for you we have a birthday\n[noise]\n\nSo uh [noise]\nThis is Marilyn explanation [noise] it was my birthday it was everything and anti brown made\nWell I also didn't have to change any of the pictures of the [noise]\nYou just in the right pitches it's I just took one interview and took all the ...\nUh keep that went on\nTo\nIn the in the drop box or just like a folder of ... so there is now there is but I I loved ones are like\n...\nAnd I'm not no way we're going to turn to to you and I we are\nAnd before we do that I Want to thank you both coming all the way out here to be truly thank\nYou [noise]\nI've come to life and the question Hi I'm just kind of\nWorks well with the last question I was wondering when you described a slow news day what if a lot is happening in the world and I love how you do the ending where you're like here's where else what else happened today how do you prioritize what story you tell on any given day so\nThe morning so a number of the team goes to the nine thirty which is also called the front page meeting where they discuss what is coming that day I'm what you expect maybe we're expecting someone to resign or expecting this hearing to happen\nIs going to do an announcement owned by the way the science desk has this interesting feature that's coming out\nAnd like the ... and the magazines going to release this profile\nUm and and we we leave there with like a ... with a rough outline of of of what what we want to cover [noise]\nAnd I think when we think about a story that is a daily story um it is a ... is a story for the daily it has to be a news event that you either must on you have to understand something complicated in order to understand what's happening in this moment it's such a development in the mall or investigation that\nWe've you know we're adding a detailed to a store we told a bunch of times we put that in a while we called the headlines at the end of the shell but if it's something where you're like oh man this is complicated this changes the way that I understand something or we need to tell the story of this person before we like\nIt so that you can understand the department of education and this new development\nWe will we will devote her show to that\nAnd there are times where we don't want to do it but we have to blow up the shell because because Donald Trump is our president because news happened and and we\nAnd and we resist for hours where we're kind of like\nYou know nothing's happening how we can make a headline and this happened just having a few weeks ago where we were making the series on family separation divided with Caitlin Dickerson end\nAny corral and we had three days planned and we had the the stories are made by ... by two of my colleagues\nAnd I'm an after the first day there was the the Manafort\nAnd Cohen guilty pleas and and and conviction and we didn't want to cover it because we had this thing planned and a member of the mass had who's one of the most senior editors of the whole newspaper came down to the daily and was like a visit lesson [laughter]\nCan't you can't ignore that and we also for like you\nKnow ... [noise]\nI'll tell you what like sometimes we defined a show by what we would never recover yeah and we decided as a rule we would never cover a presidential tweet as an episode because like it's just\nNot enough [noise] ah\n[noise]\nYou know I mean like if you think about what they said they always such a like a plot character suspense morals state like please\nJust like it's in Congress was who was who we are\nBut I Will say that there was a there was the day that that um the comment was made we we chose at the same question of like your comment the whole comment was made the um we we talk about the idea of like can we do an episode about a sentence\nAnd we all are like I don't know like what are we going to say like it that's rude to that like you know it's like it's not that much to say about it until we until we realized that\nThere is like that there was a story that led up to that moment that like\nThere there had been these these two senators from across the aisle who were coming to terms office to present a bipartisan immigration deal and then out of the wings came all of these immigration hawks who are like super conservative and they were literally walking into the oval yes\nIn a surprise addition to the to the meeting and and they're whispering in Trump's ear and pulling and in this direction\nAnd and these two bipartisan senators are saying no no what about our ideal and in this moment he says this comment and it was in and that was the daily story and we were like okay we got to do it without an episode and and I I I feel like when when we when we can ... in that way where like this we matters because\nNo choice [laughter]\nSeven are are in the day all the time\nThey also have in the in the here's where they'll send you to do that yeah\nYeah so\nI'm so one of my favorite parts of the daily is I'm kind of humanizing aspect that gives to all these\nReporters that I get to read from it in print but then hearing the voice and things like that it's just a whole different elements I'm my question is how have those reporters who have been featured on the daily um how\nTo that and new form or a new kind of medium of journalism and I know like for some of your up here it's created this other level of kind of fame maybe very nice same I'm not sure but\nIt's like the fame [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Your World", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "10"}
