New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of all the way people are able to move on with me\nYeah because I think record for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so\nBecause I mean this has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television that this is made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mosque because like even someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever\nBeing monster bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me\n\nAlive even with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe and can't my father's ...

tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me [noise]\n[noise] my inner river was very strong and [noise]\n\nBy that first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been punched one too many times [noise]\nToo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhen did you realize that you were funny [laughter]\nSo my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was\nFunny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his\nDaring [laughter] you know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons or their challenges through humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy in the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by calling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and\nWe always\nMade sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalk about guys are talking about sorrow probably you know I don't like but I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to\nConstantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life is important and now that I Do battle because having grown up\nOh no I Do battle because having grown up with you know one fight in Jersey on one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country and when I did the pet dog I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really\nThought it was the disability that was going to be the thing that I was championing

them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip you took with the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after it came out something happened back in New York at least one again usually felt welcome then accepted\nAnd hate group spent three

telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny\nBut just changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nDo you talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was\nPretty successful yeah so I

separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you\nKnow a lot of different three of them do remember now [noise] and credible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nYou got one person to laugh and a couple of you will laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a

you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did\nAs a as a young person when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas or thoughts and stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable unhappy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nLike at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at

might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in\nWaves and you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark helpless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly
