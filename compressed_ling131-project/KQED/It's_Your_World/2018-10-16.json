MORNING EDITION\n... six twenty three and a twenty three\n\n... San Francisco and kick you were young north highlands Sacramento to Oakland\nWelcome to world affairs the weekly broadcast in the world events counts now I'm Jane Wells your host\nWhen Britain or needs the European Union in March what will it mean for the relationship between Northern Ireland which is part of Britain and the republic of Ireland its neighbor\nHow can each prepare for accent joining need to consider these questions is O'Toole oh he's\nA journalist or an Irish Times and the author of the forthcoming book breakfast the politics of paint this broadcast is made possible each week by the generous supportive Chevron medium rare and the Draper Richard Kaplan foundation\nThe breakfast ought to referendum and twenty sixteen I seen as having had an enormously device effect I Want to have a sense from you as to\nTo break down and I thought oh this interesting sense Northern Ireland Scotland voted remain um that your sense of of what was behind the outlook is behind they [noise] they positive outlook on on the inside or they shouldn't allow\nSo obviously when you get something as large as if they're going to be many factors feeding into it but I think the biggest ones\nIs something that ... and I blame myself as much as anybody else we should have seen coming on that nobody's really solve coming out it's English nationalism [laughter] if you look at the Brexit vote it's a\nVery largely concentrated in non metropolitan England so if you take out loans on the one or two of the other major cities\nWere loaned them from the you know the cop swallows and ... and stem tore Shires up to the state will turn on the sale working class hotlines or of all of us ... are the places in which the Brexit vote is sixty five Seventy even eighty percent\n[noise] and the reason we should have seen this coming laws because something extraordinary was happening that was happening quietly um but nonetheless it was really showing up very much and and social surveys [noise]\nUh which was that the English were beginning to assert themselves as a political community there are beginning to say actually you know what this British thing when we're not that interested in anymore we want speak English yeah\nNobody paid much attention to this because no political party was was driving is that the media would largely ignoring it so so wasn't like it was something that was you know people who are being told to feel\nSo it was organic and it was it was coming out of those I think in retrospect things that we should have expected\nThe English are very proud nation they they you know the very long history um arguably was the first functioning nation states and the world's been in the in our time's going right back to the the fourteenth century [noise]\nThey had a language they had a\nSet of customs laws they had all the things that you would associate with and I should say very early on a very strong proud I'd have to take\nWhy are we surprised that it's coming back while we're surprised because it did an extraordinary thing in a way it sort of fake it's own death and\nIt it rules itself into two other constructs one of which was the empire of course ... and the other fish was the union with sweat Scotland ... on islands that are from for hundreds\nAnd English and it was sort of contained within these structures\nSo if those two structures change well then you would expect English history in March and the empire they've gone\nOr not everybody knows that but it is ... and the union began to change radically in the late Nineteen Ninety two big things happen like that and I think they about fast peace agreements in Northern Ireland Nineteen\nNinety eight and the following year the Scottish parliament's was established but once you begin to see coming up really in surveys the into the beginning of the century is the English was drawing mentally from the union\nAnd we should have seen this that twenty eleven national census last ... than taking them to UK a large majority of people in England was offered the choice what do you think of yourself as British British English or English large majorities set English only ...\nAnd they also are the big surveys were asking things like who represents England who should make the laws for England\nSponsorship of the cake humid Eli dream bike super micro Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at uber Mike Rowe dot com\nAnd you know in in in twenty twelve big survey asked that question do you think the status quo where Westminster makes laws for England is okay\nTwenty four percent an English people said yeah it's okay to stop the squirrels okay three quarters of them are saying I don't want my laws for me as an English parts made in Westminster this is extraordinary stuff and we weren't paying attention to because I said there was no there was no political movements there was no real media attention paid to it [noise]\nBut this was going to emerge somewhere I don't know it ... and that kind of frustration that nobody's listening to us nobody nobody pays attention nobody's even naming the fact that we think of ourselves as look at me and see I'm I'm wants to be\nRecognized as such and\nThe first opportunity that English got to give somebody a kick and say pay attention to us was was the ... ... and therefore in retrospect it's not that surprising that they took that opportunity to say we want to be paid attention to it and\nThe irony is that breaks it actually doesn't answer any of those questions you know it really doesn't meet the needs that were there\nBut I think this is an underlying for someone we're still grappling with what are the implications of\nThe rising of English nationalism for Scotland's for ... for for Ireland's a because of course we all day and intertwined for for so long that uh if if if this is happening it's it's it's seismic in terms of all of those relationships with no\nSo this resistance to integration is ... there are some real world or anxieties they had the euro zone crisis the economic crisis that sense of\nOf contagion O'Hara integrated um immigration is a larger issue um where there are there's that that they were literally sort of issue oriented that that ... that drove it as well\nAs I said the sense of resentment and yes so ... I I think there are ... one of the biggest underlying it is a really coming from the from the rights and you know the right thing in the Tory party is\nYou have to remember those are very strong agenda to interact complete the agenda of naturalism you know the patch or Islam This markets philosophy\nThis is breaking up to staked\nHanding over the public services that regulate how service all those kinds of things to market forces was never a complete tips mhm [noise]\nAnd the European Union is seen as a kind of super states I'm Out of there for a constraint on on the ... the final yeah Patrick destiny so coming from the from from a very influential section of Atari partially you've got that driver [noise]\nBut it meets something completely different side which is ... that's not what's appealing to the working class communities and in some ... ... they want the opposite they won ... states protect them they want all of his public services that they want to feel the security [noise]\nSo Bernard is is it in in this sense yes it's driven by all of these kinds of things but they're they're awesome complete opposites and\nThe key to the brags that referendum was David Cameron's extraordinary\nArrogance in one very simple and respects\n[noise] while he could have done as he could have lifted the phone and he could've spoken to his good friend the hours trying to start at the time at the Kennedy and said you guys do referendum so in our we have a referendum without something almost every year we have a written constitution and it can be changed by popular vote but so we have a friend of a almost every year we have we have our friends with\nWi Fi California yeah well you know we don't exactly what we have like really big ones like ... you know this year we we we voted on abortion which is really divisive issue and liberalize emotional those two years ago we we brought a same sex marriage referendum we know how we don't have to do the stuff we know how it works\nAnd it would have been really interesting is I have a camera who just said look okay how does this thing work when you call reference about what actually really happens\nArms before thing I Would have told them as it it won't be just about what's on the ballot paper you know a a referendum if people all sorts of emotional outlets you know to to to say I'm really angry about this and therefore I'm going to take it out on them you know in in this moment [noise]\nYou have to remember this was never designed to be a border that it's it's if it was you would you know if you were designing bars he would fire the people's came up with this so because when it ... around all sorts of things\nYou can you can be driving along and you may have crossed the border five times up knowing you know it just does all over the place to reason is because it was never meant to be a border it was [noise]\nSupposed to be a kind of temporary arrangements\nWhen the island was partitions in Nineteen Twenty one there was this kinds of Bob very disputes with agreements that's that's a that's six northeastern counties would remain park has a kingdom but the Protestant majority wanted to be part of the u._k.\nAnd a twenty six other counties would which what Catholic majorities uh would would would form the Irish Sweepstakes which became the extra public\nOn the border question was kind of left over 'cause it's actually it's very complicated why don't we saw the border commissioned a boundary commission as it was called and we work on a proper border and they spent five years doing this and they couldn't degree so the status quo just remains in place with this kind of crazy border\nAnd in a way of sauce it didn't matter too much but now it matters so so what you're saying is that this Florida which was never meant to be a border which is unbelievable\nUncontrollable remember the British during the during the troubles the British had about ... at any given point I mean they have ten thousand troops on the border but a ... helicopters\nWatch tower is very ... technology could not stop the Iraq from taking you know bombs bullets gums whatever across anytime they want to you know because if we can so we know it's an old police a little border it's it's an it's the most porous borders you can possibly imagine\n[noise] on your now proposing with brags is to make this border not just an international frontier but a frontier between a block of twenty seven countries on that outside the country you know so it's something that has never ever being in its in its history and could never happen and just by anybody [noise]\nSo this is this is deeply reckless because it's it's not offensive you know what I'm saying you've been doing over there you Irish people about actually you know we don't care about it anymore\nWe're going to stop them and this is not me as a ... there's there's there's two pieces of research they asked to leave voters there was a big survey the people who voted leave or ask the question very directly\nUm woods the destruction of the Irish peace process be a price worth paying for breakfast\nEighty three percent of voters said yes\nAbsolutely [laughter] is another survey just I just that last week which has pretty much the same thing\nAs conservative as members of the conservative are say would you be prepared to Saudi actually process to have breakfast is success eighty percent yes ... ... ... I don't want to be most of the ... you know ... I don't blame people about it but but it is an act of extraordinary reckless or you know to say\nActually we don't really care what's going on over there aren't as I said it's kind of thing you people are foreign\nEven while at the same time is just in your part of the United kingdom this is Britain's own territory this is not you know it's not somewhere off in the mid Atlantic you know this is a place that Britain claims to be absolutely integral part of its own territory so\nDo the kind of reckless affair there's no salt and ... there's there's no real\nSponsorship of the cake weedy life's dream bike super micro Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at uber Mike Rowe dot com\nActive extraordinary recklessness you know to say actually we don't really care what's going on over there are things I said it's kind of saying you people are far him\nEven while at the same time it's just in your part of the United kingdom this is Britain's own territory this is not you know it's not somewhere off in the mid Atlantic you know this is a place that Britain claims to be an absolute into real parts of its own territory so\nThere's a kind of recklessness here there's no salt advisors there there's there's no real\nPlan I'm so what the Irish Government has had to do is to say look we can't trust you on this you know [noise]\nIf so everybody's saying so it looks very simple everybody signs their cannot be our border and you know the including Bush governments governments European Union they are almost everybody saying ... already taco back to that so\nThat looks very simple see all the great what's the problem [noise] I signed up just trust us on his will work out something [noise] uh after we've done to deal with the European Union our going to get the fabulous deal and it's going to give us you know we're going to have cake and eat cake\nAnd everything is going to be just wonderful solve costs will be ... I'll be fine\nAnd the government I I think we may not be forced to say look we can't take it on trust that it's going to be fine this is this is a really serious matter for I mean is this is an existential question for us [noise]\nAnd you must know plan here you have absolutely no sense at all of of of how you're going to achieve this thing that we all green and listen shaved [noise]\nSo this is why are you got this I won't bore you with all the the the bureaucratic language but the the ... stop you may have heard enough which is a paint us now stopping ... which is\nThe European Union on the on a ... I actually hear your opinion and not just the outcome of the European Union in concert with the government is saying\nThere can be no agreements with ... we're not doing any deal with you until you have a guarantee about the fact that there will be no ours border enough assaults of trust us about this but an actual legal international guarantee it has to be placed in stone\nOr something to that and what what the Irish and the Europeans are saying is look if you can come up with another solution\nFine absolutely you know if you think there's something magical technological solution that you can have a border between the European Union and Britain that has no infrastructure tall that never existed in human history from do you think you can do about fine where are all delighted with\nBooks all we're saying is if you can't there's a fail safe which is that your guarantee that there won't be one and therefore you're gonna have to do certain other things\nAnd of course the other things mean that really the only way that I think this can work it still is if the u._k. has a very soft pranks if it stays within the European customs union and in large parts of the single market\nBut of course that's exactly what I'm saying it's along with that they will not and that's why the ... the ... the talks are in such a quagmire I mean they've been unable to move forward on it's all about the Irish issue and you know that the Irish issue is absolutely central to the whole thing\nIt's a great example of the return of the repressed you know if you if you don't talk about it if you would know or is it gonna come back and bite you and that's really what's happening with breakfast and so what are the chances of a compromise in\nWhich Northern Ireland can um it can in fact be separated off from breakfast they allowed to be part of the new even now it's part of the United kingdom so um\nThey they used to be fair to let them have often been a critic of the but it's it's actually been pretty extraordinary on this issue um\n[noise] so that they do even to go see a nation that Michelle Burnette who's leading the same I'm On the ... really are everybody from the inside of spoken about this a sense but party I said it's simply that there are three things to British officers out before we can get into talking about the final a\nDeal is what what the relationships are looked like\nPeople's money our lumps\nPeople is just mutual writes between you know senator decay gonna be living in European Union countries one of their rights and vice versa no complicated bit of doing it for all and but as I you know it's it's normal diplomacy right it's a source of the middle caters to it's fixable it's pretty much agreed [noise]\nMoney was a divorce still ride which was how much this how much how many ongoing commitments to you have the European Union budget is the ... like it too in terms of money\nIt translates into about forty billion pounds darling it's fine it's done you know that that's kind of great are listen when it's not great but for all the reasons we've been talking about [noise]\nAnd I genuinely think the British they'll look at the Irish are kind of small you know when it comes to it ran as the big kind of spin on the last minute some of the way things are done we'll just fudge the Irish like come on you know it took ... you know there'll be a formula of words [noise]\nAnd I think they miscalculated really fundamentally about this you know that they thought I could be bullied but they also saw the European Union would say oh the arts bloody Irish that's you know forget about it on his practice has not happened there hasn't been a single cigarette paper between the artist edition of European Union position [noise] so what's your opinion has done is has been very generous and it said look\nI just really difficult for us where a rule downs organization the European Union is just a set of rules and if we start playing fast and loose with those rules and say well you can do a bit of this and you can do that\nA whole thing will come out however they said look I don't know what I was kind of first of all that suffered a loss right it's a it's it's it's a part of the world that are really hard time secondly it's small it's a million and a half people it's not going to threaten the entire structure of their opinion [noise]\nThe less be generous let's say in your case you can have\nIn your case you can have the best of both worlds right we're not saying you have to leave the u._k.\n[noise] so therefore illegally insolvency terms you you'll be leaving the European Union however you can continue to act as if you're in the European Union [noise]\nI'm Wondering how that they've done this is because it's a very hard thing to remember a book under the peace deal with Mike and Katie Steele every single person in Northern Ireland has an absolute rise to the European Union citizenship\nThat cannot be changed my breakfast why because I have a right to Irish Citizenship so he's going to be Irish or British are both the the legal manifestation of that is you are in fact when I was ... you're on TALK to our citizenship\nIn this in this circumstance of starting from scratch\nTo say less than they do say trite but I don't know maybe some people have been involved in trade deals I haven't but I've spoken to people how they take a minimum of seven years\nThe candidates are looking for took seven years cynical ... you know cuts incredibly complex I mean you're talking about you know life savings and standards for you know the most extraordinary goods and services and all sorts of things and [noise] um so\nShe's being pushed in this direction she has realized that she has to compromise struck so British industry is now\nSaying this is catastrophic I mean we're we're we're facing possible catastrophe here so I'm On\nThe suicides have but you know for example um [noise] the ... the European aerospace industry the only um rival to buy a house in terms of making planes\n[noise] uh is essentially a Franco British creation right so the Airbus planes are made in France and actually largely in Wales in in in ... [noise]\nSponsorship of the cake weedy life's dream bike super micro Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more at uber Mike Rowe dot com\n... [noise] that's just one example ... bills a five hundred thousand cars a year in ... which voted for Brexit but this working class sounds off its biggest employer isn't it sound the Japanese carmaker\nNissan brings in I I I have to myself when I saw this figure I thought I was wrong I I actually go back and check you know but it's actually true they they bring in three million\nAnd day not about a week a day they bring in the mood in parts of the day they are I all of these big companies are now they are fully integrated supply chains on it's all just in time and they found half\nA day's stores on hands in so doing with half a day after half a day the plan to close this town now if you are saying\nThose three million ... have to be checked [laughter] every day it's just impossible just kind of between them\nSo they had to miss an M recently came out and said look we we didn't say this during the Brexit referendum 'cause we didn't think it was going to pass you know we just thought if if we interfere will be accused of you know trying to frighten people in the past but I'm really sorry we would just have to close I mean we just cannot you know we just can't do this we've invested billions and as we don't want to do the ... of the\nState of the ... to ... percent of the people that really works has some toxic were delighted with this\nBook we cannot be\nHaving terrify non tariff barriers for three million things going in and out of that that's never mind the actual cars that are for stress it's a system in terms of ... and this is British industry saying we are facing catastrophe if there's no deal all of this stuff comes to health people are out of work does it does a normal kind of economic hit\nOne of the political consequences of that who who knows however what has happened this nobody including through somebody has built up the political off hours hate to say come on folks get real here you know\n... in the process is everywhere evolution always has you know fantastic utopia and I think it's all going to be great [noise]\nIt was those people who are stopping us from being wonderful and as soon as we get rid of those people must be wonderful you know that's the basic knowledge of of a revolution and then somebody has to ... whatever let's say\nYou can't keep doing this you know ... ... ... ... you know ... some kind of rationality has to be applied here\nAnd the problem is that brings it undermines political authority such an extent in London that there's now nobody I mean not the government's not the opposition so the Labour Party which is the alternative governments is also completely divided about Brexit on his afraid to really say anything very much\nSo once you have is you you have a situation in which there was a real need for pragmatism adverse starts a genuine patriotism or somebody says look\nThis is self harm the ... it's not in our interest to continue to try to do this stuff at this level somebody has tremendous I just don't you all sorts of compromises on you won't like some of them that's what pragmatic life is like\nI'm Theresa May is the person is going to have to say that but she has two parents herself to be in the ... so she started taking this very extreme position [noise]\nAn over the next two weeks you don't have to come out and say look what people are just shut up [laughter] I'm really sorry but you can't keep doing this kind of crazy\nYou know it nationalist revolution stuff this was people's livelihoods this is this the future of the country this is ... ... with ... in real people's lives\nAnd we have to speak honestly to them and say how's your leader I'm not going to lead you off a cliff ... ... ... and we don't know yet whether she has the authority to do this you know and this is an extraordinary situation I Can't think of anything we've ever seen like a [noise]\nI don't know if you remember ... finally the ... the ... movie if you've ever go back and wants to look at it and understand breaks it as if the Italian job with Michael Caine in\nAs a ... it's all about going into Europe and so it kind of a very very Seinfeld\nBut I don't you remember that ends up it ends up with what they steal all the goal from children the Italians and the ... put it onto a bus and they're getting away and the going through that the alpine passes and then they take a wrong turn on the bus is left\n... over the cliff us going like that and that the goal is on one end and all the crew of criminals are on the other half and if they move towards the goals the boss will will will go off and if they don't move towards the gold and the whole\nIs point of and that's exactly right under the ... so that I like to move forward to to get this prize but they was on the can't get out of the um it's it's really starting to situation\nSo is this loss of authority on everyone's part and on on our part is part is that the greatest danger yes I'm not on and it's it's the problem for us in our lives is danger for of course because you know we we have no say in this we we we cannot insulin swap happens in Britain themselves\n[noise] um [noise] uh but you know it's it's it's it's a real lesson to us I think we all quite rightly you know I I'm I'm I'm a professional I just had her you know I tried to get make people question\nPower is being used and how politics is working on this kind of things I'm after democratic duty to do that and I and that's one of the guys democracy it's like I'm not being super silly us about people who voted for banks that they they engaged in in in a political choice [noise]\nBut ... has to be balanced by a sense that actually we all depends on political structures back\nHave no say in this we we we cannot insulin swap that happens in Britain itself\n[noise] um [noise] but you know it's it's it's it's a real lesson to us I think we all ... you know I I'm I'm I'm a professional\nI just had her you know I tried to get make people question about how power is being used and how politics is working all kinds of things I'm just after the Democratic duty to do that and I and and that's one of the guys democracy it's like\nI'm not being super serious about people who voted for banks that they they engage in in in a political choice\n[noise] book\n... has to be balanced by a sense that actually we all depends on political structures that we may criticize on we may dislike\nBut we\nWould tops Troy those political structures without being very careful as to walk takes their place on a walk kind of um institutions like my my my work for us and the institutions themselves have to have some democratic us already\nWhat happened in Britain was they use the Democratic mechanisms that that is not part of their culture referendum if you look at the entire history of of political self consciousness in in England in particular it's about the sovereignty of parliament that's what you know English history is about\nTo turn around I'm One of the most critical existential questions that you faced in in in in your mouth and history and say actually this is not going to do the parliament's go it's going to be done by a popular votes\nThat's fine if you think that through ... how are we going to follow through on us\nBut to have them do not so they've they've placed on ... in this sacred moments June twenty third twenty six thing that moment to people spoke with lots of people say you know they said we we don't want to be in that tank [laughter]\nThat's fine but it doesn't really get you very far doesn't tell you how you're going to do this and how are you going to do with with least south harm [noise] I mean in my view it's crazy decision that I I think\nI I I I talked to a guy who was a very old I'm tried union to go see eight or ... and he said to me a very pro British guy um and he said you know the only three possibilities if if you're going into a negotiation or you know as a as a labor leader you say\nYou know one of my ... I'm In this case Ronnie ... possibilities one was to stop the flow which they have rejected\nThe second was something better than the status quo which the European Union could not possibly give a leaving member I mean ... if you can leave a club I have all the benefits\nOutside of is that the club is gone but ... you know the literally the European Union would would dissolve in in five years if the if Britain ends up something better than the status quo by leaving the European Union gum", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Your World", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "16"}
