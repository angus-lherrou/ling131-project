show today ideas about building more humane cities cities that make space for everyone and especially the most vulnerable [noise] were you um were you born in like a yeah I actually was and I spent most of my life wasn't legal says your home is illegals as your home since we became\nHuman in the world [laughter] yeah you know this is accurate is\nThe man ... she's a writer in Lagos, Nigeria but the kind of\nStuff I write is generally about rights issues human rights do I feel good on the rights of the urban poor [laughter]\nCan you describe what ... is like like what what what I see if I Want their ... so I guess it depends\nOn which the eagles you live and right and I think that maybe this universe where the where cities up once and like you can be in the same physical space\nBut because of your identity or your social occasion you experience it completely different for instance the legal said I experience is different from the legal that my daughter many eggs being\nSo you're driving down the fed mean language and you look\nTo your right to left as the case may be and you can see some of the fishing from specimens that have now been termed slums along the side of the bridge you can see the land feeling that's being done on the other side within me cleaning the legs\nAnd in order to build some sort of middle class entertainment slash parking garage using and if you're going from the mainland is island in the landscape of the season\nChanges the houses are bigger ... more expensive cars and nicer [laughter] they're traffic lights the words you know I think we've got lists of\nWhich legos you experience you do see this darkness and the difference is along those lines\nAnd that ... get only deep and over the past forty or fifty years in like thanks in part to an explosion in population gross and the changing economy class\nHas become much more than he meant it [noise] um class mobility is not as\nCut as possible that used to be in my grandfather's generation it was it was easy to send one or two children to school and have them access jobs and then have them than their siblings their cousins to school and ... sort of lift the whole family\nHave them than their siblings or their cousins to school and flew me sort of lift the whole family\nOut of poverty in one or two generations right it's not news on their possible\nMilitary man that they

if people knew Lagos so\nAmong the euro by we haven't seen a coup wouldn't be one day which can be translated to me that leave us will welcome anyone but not seeing is becoming less and that is true\nMany like oceans including the descendants of this Fisher people who arrived generations before my grandfather and I was being pushed out to make room for an emergency that has been described as

focusing on the eradication of poverty as you would expect the strategy of choice focuses on him in Eighteen before\nLast up to buy the governor announced plans to demolish every single water funk ... off\nThere more than forty of these indigenous communities all over the city over three hundred thousand people living in them\nTo do by making a hundred year old fishing village with a population of about three quarters of Monaco and similar potential for beach front luxury [noise] was one of the first to be targeted [noise]\nIt it's almost like [noise]\nInnocent and and this happens all around the world it's it's almost like um city's much to hide people who are poor people who live in ... in places that that are characterized or slump like they want to hide those places from the gaze of the world mhm\nYes to attract foreign investment you know you you have to look like where the foreign investment is coming from the Iraqis anything that doesn't look like that even though nothing looks like but I mean by definition the whole of legal through the slum right let's be honest if we take\nThe technical definition of lack of\nSanitation services lack of infrastructure the whole city is a slum but I'm more and more you hear agencies of government officials talked about ultra modern projects and what they really mean is stuff that's like steel and concrete than glass and mirrors and you look like the New York's skyline type is it\nSo you can use this sort of rhetoric\nTo push out poor populations or at least that's what they hope will happen but the truth is like in the end poor people\nTo just disappear right so if you push them further and further away from wherever it is that you want to make into a shiny suburb\nOr you will ... [noise]\nWhere do you think they're going to go\nThe conditions that caused us to define as such in neighborhoods that slums can be effective you improved but not without recognizing humanity and the agency of the people living in them\nAnd Lagos sweat public goods are really publicly available some do either as often at the forefront of innovation solutions\nI should've been disconnected from the grid for months because the power company couldn't figure out how to collective one supplements designed a system that collects device German chances and goes everyone cheaper rates into the bargain\nAnother settlement created a reform program that hires look bad boys that security you know every chick at every high dollars so now troublemakers are more likely to get caught and fortunately for these and few of you end up and gave him a criminal activity\nSums are and in fact housing solutions but they also prime examples of the innovation adaptability and resilience after Sunday Sun and the heart of every functional city we have our own\nIdentity our own risen and as anyone in Las Vegas and tell you for like a very often the source of the city's character without it for us would not be known for its music guards and less energy or even the fact that you can buy an eyesore drink or a puppy so your car window [noise]\n\nShe spent a time and some of these neighborhoods that are defined Islam and what what you experienced what were what were they like for you [noise]\nI mean I remember the first time I went into\nOne from that's literally built on like an island of garbage\nThat sort of it's packed really tightened the and then\nIt's layered was sodas and then there was sort of some sort of ... or send us something\nBut then if you go into the place and you see the people who live here and they have\nKinds of ... they're making marginal profits on a daily basis but you know\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford dot EDU\nIn particular that there's not that much\nThat is so significantly different about them and\nThere are people who have economic wherewithal to live elsewhere who just don't want to because they're the quality of life that comes from living in such close proximity to your friends and your family\nAnd your colleagues in your church members of your the people you go to mosque we it's there's a sense of community that is so rich that is almost impossible to get it more for\nSupport for the tide radio our comes from the any e Casey foundation developing solutions to support strong families and communities to help ensure a brighter future for America's children more information is available at a E.

helping NPR advance journalistic excellence in the digital age\nIt to the Ted radio hour from NPR guy rise and on the show today\nIdeas about cities and how we can build more humane once and just before the break we were hearing from architect the ... party in Michigan says designed could be part of the solution but it largely depends on how we use technology and technology was uh\nTechnology and\nTechnology was a big part of the problem and the twentieth century when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention and we recreated our landscape around in the twenty first century\nTechnology can be part of the solution is it bends to the needs\nOf the world and so what do I mean by that take the economist vehicle I don't think the economists vehicle is exciting because it's a driverless car I think what's exciting about the economist vehicle is the promise that we have these small urban vehicles that could safely coal mingle with ... and bicycle\nThat would enable us to design Jew main streets again streets without firms maybe streets like wouldn't walkways on fire island\nOr maybe we could design streets where's the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melting snow helps you with your fitness when you walk\nOr remember those big ladder fire trucks what if we could replace them at all the asphalt that comes with them with drones and robots that to the rescue people from burning buildings\nAnd if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity\nBut now it like you to really imagine with me [noise] imagine if we could design the Hubbard craft wheelchair [noise]\nWrite an invention that would\nNot only allow equal access but would enable us to build\nThe Italian hill town of the twenty first century [noise]\nI think you'd be amazed to know that it's just a few of these inventions\nResponsive to human need would completely transformed the way we could build our city [noise]\nI mean the thing is right let's say we do transform cities into into these more humane places like\nWith the help of technology or whatever I mean there will still be some level of inhumanity in them right in right not is it possible to have no social scored at all\nYou know part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technology is in the room a technologist can be wonderful people but they can also be a bit a historical and what I was hoping to convey to a room full of technologists is we need them to invent stuff\nThat helps us build more humane cities right firefighting drones and the and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and so forth so we can look at all those codes and standards that we have to build with\nAnd change them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first twenty second century because technology is allowed us to change those standards [noise]\nUm but that's not the goal the goal is the standards are changing so we can design this infrastructure so we create some more social friction cities\nAt their best our engines of social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring\nAnd you saw what was happening in ... square what you saw what it was happening in Tunisia\nIt's because cities tend to be the platform for social change in ... and social friction requires a kind of lay in my book I call it an infrastructure of opportunity this idea that you're building public\nSpaces subway systems the farmers' market places where people who are from different walks of life meat eyeball to eyeball as social friction is fundamentally what advances civilization and I think that's really the heart of the architects\nFish ... he's a professor at Columbia in his latest book is called a country of\nCities a manifesto for urban America you can see his full talk at ... dot com\nOn the show today buildings you named cities ideas that many of the challenges that cities now face\nWhen you were mayor for eight years you get a chance to meet people from all over his Richard\nBarry he was the mayor of Albuquerque New Mexico from two thousand nine to two thousand Seventeen\nAnd you'll meet people at the grocery store you'll meet people on the street you start having conversations you'll do deep dives in your community and you you start becoming keenly aware that as much as you think you understand you\nJust haven't walked a mile new shoes [noise]\nDuring Richard's time as mayor Albuquerque sun spike in its homeless population and lots more people panhandling and the streets and so it Richard wanted to come up with a more humane approach for how to deal with it\nSo I saw a gentleman on a dry fifteenth twenty Fifteen I Believe was the day I was on my way back to city hall from a lunch meeting and he was holding a sign that said he wants a job\nAnd listen I'm a B student and I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff and I said listen I saw gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different\nWhy don't we make government less complicated rather than more complicated why don't we take this man at his word\nAnd I grew up in ... in Nebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people putting my grandparents and my parents work hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning and accomplish something that's been engrained in me since I was a child\nAnd so we just wanted to take that and presents an opportunity\nTo worry about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up through the dignity of work\nThere's more from Richard bury on the stage\nBecause there is a better way because I Believe it was a better way\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info sessions will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford dot edu\nWe know there's dignity and work we also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that their community is willing to invest in them\nFirst and because we're\nAll wired to be kind and compassionate it always feels good to have a couple of dollars to someone that is a neat\nBut if you talk to panhandlers many of them will tell you that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body that go towards feeding addiction\nIs Albuquerque the beautiful place where a mile\nThe Sandia Mountains on the east the Rio Grande runs through the center of our city where there's always something to do always leads to pull later to pick up\nSo if you're going to have an initiative like this in your city you have to ask yourself to questions first one is is there anything left to do in your city and if the answer is no would you please give me or mayors phone number because I Need some advice\nThe second question you have to ask is this are you are solutions to panhandling working if you're taking the phenotype approach I'm going to suggest there solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting to the root of the problem in your city\nSo if you have something to do you need people that need something to do the good news is is not that complicated [noise]\nSo so would you do we took an old van from our motor pool a old dodge van but some tires on it I mean sure the brakes worked and uh then we reached out to St Martin's hope works in Albuquerque\nAnd we asked for their health or a nonprofit that works with the homeless and they do a lot of great things from feeding programs to housing programs to implement programs\nWe took a fifty thousand dollars we created a pilot program and we hired them to be the facilitators to do the paperwork to pay the individuals that work for the day\nTo do all of the functional things that needed to be done to run the program\nBut more importantly we had this notion that if you live somebody up for the day they are naturally going to feel better about themselves about their circumstances somebody believed in them today\nAnd they may have an opportunity and may be inclined to try to reach out for some of the services that maybe they hadn't reached out for before so we wanted to make those available\nAnd the seven thousand jobs that have been created day jobs or through the better way program we've been able to impact or almost a sixteen or Seventeen hundred people and and those three hundred and sixty five of them have actually reached out for mental health services substance abuse services the things that they need to do to make improvements in their lives and
