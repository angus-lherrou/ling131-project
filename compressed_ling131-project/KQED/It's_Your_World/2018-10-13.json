of my favorites is in the world San Francisco so I'm happy to be here\nAnd thank you all for taking the time to come out and I hope the the the sort of part of your check list in terms of good citizenship because we have a lot to talk about right now [noise] we really do\nIs I mean the question of what our back in life but how do we make our politics work there's so much to talk about I was the day I noticed this really is true there was a report an infant wars\nThat Hurricane Lane was bearing down on Hawaii had been split into by an energy being was fired from Antarctica by me [laughter]\nUm [noise]\nAnd I thought well I mean I I thought to myself man we're really good at this is terrible stuff how ... how did they miss the fact that I fired at from from the north pole [laughter] um\nBut seriously I very upset that they ever call David ... action for Florence coming out on the east coast but this has just\nThere was a report on info wars that Hurricane Lane was bearing down on Hawaii had been split in to buy an energy being was fired from Antarctica by me [laughter]\nUm [noise]\nAnd and I thought well I I thought I thought to myself now we have really a ... this is terrible stuff how can they how did they miss the fact that I fired at from from the north pole on but seriously I'm very upset that they ever call data\nAction for Florence coming out on the east coast but this is just we're dealing with a whole different world and for those of us who really do love our country and who consider ourselves patriots and who are on our the role of truth in\nThe sustaining of our democracy or this is a very\nPearl is an important moment so I look forward very very much to the conversation ...\nI Know there'll be lots of questions from the audience that tell us again why did you sign on and reflect on your long live by that I can actually gave part of the answer not on I\nI yeah I did get fired or the answer\nI I did it because I think it's relevant to the moment that we're in I think Bob Woodward's book is a terrific summary and extraordinarily well reported as he does and every one of you in here knows that there is no way as publisher I'm sitting my publisher to and there is no way that she\nIs going to go to print without the lawyers main confident about sources and what he does his hundreds of hours of tapes so people need to be careful what they wish for in terms of documentation here and yellow you're going to hear denials here and denials there but\nI think everybody knows how it works my book is the southern okay it's terrible\nWe now have the facts that document what is happening\nWhat do we do about it and what should America look like what should we be doing in terms of making our system work and bring ourselves back to ground zero\nDevin democratically little league\nAnd um I did my book in the tracing\nOf the things I've been involved in from the beginning of my raising my right hand there's a chapter called raising my right hand where I talk about why we went in the service my my parents were greatest generation parents my mother\nI'm born in Paris a live the better part of our early ... nothing better by all of our early life in Europe because my grandfather was a was a businessman\nInvolved in a business in Europe at the time live between England and France right up until World War two and a actually way back when he was involved with the surge in any in the founding of the bank of America and to my regret sold his stock too early\n[laughter] uh uh\nSo my mother didn't come to America really until she was about twenty four years old\nBut she's American she comes from the Boston family and and she lived there and\nThat introduced me toward a very young stage I write in the book about how my earliest memories walking with my mother in France Nineteen forty seven I was four years old and holding her hand and she was crying and I didn't know why she was crying it upset me but\nI could feel like it here at the glass crunching beneath my feet\nAs we walk through the ruins of what had been the family home and all that I remember seeing a chimney go up into the sky and the and the stairwells going up into the sky it was all of us left I remembered visiting the beaches Normandy four years after the war there was still the ... civil war on those beaches\nYou know blown out tanks and so forth Higgins boats\nAnd it became it it it it just imbued me with a sense of service sense of duty sense of responsibility and a group of us are Yale uh my good friend Freddie Smith the founder set ... who founded shut acts really in our dormitory when he got to see on his economics paper\nThat that was fed ex um and it's an a plus you know folks a plush flush uh\nAnd and my room mate dandy but our bureau in into the Marines and and you know a bunch of us felt a sense of responsibility in Nineteen sixty five Lyndon Johnson and ask for troops and and we were part of that answer [noise]\nSo it right there because I think all of that journey without any arrogance without any sense of wow look at me or something that's not what it's about I think it's an American story I think it's an American journey\nAnd I think it represents how you make America the deaths of what we know it can be because in Nineteen Seventy one we had a president who broke the law\nThat it was adopted and what I argued in a very tense meeting couple of nights earlier when it almost fell apart as people were arguing to go back to the old formula about developed countries doing more and less developed countries which is a killer formula\nI pointed out that this was the single most gala tyranny and shared responsibility you could have lie\nEach country decided itself what it was going to do and no country decided to do anything that he couldn't do that's why President Trump outright lied to Americans they pulled out\nBecause he stood up and running the country and said this agreement push too great a burden on the United states\nAnd the answer is no it didn't\nIt only undertook to do what we knew we could do with the support of major fortune five hundred companies ranging from the Google and the apples and so forth all the way to Exxon Mobil\nAnd BP and others all of them said we need to do this so we cannot imagine what was the significance of powers the significance of Paris is that we\nBasically put our faith in the private sector which I Believe I I've grown more and more private sector oriented over the years because as you watch the world changing as the dynamic changes we're witnessing industrial revolution science changes and culture and society and workplace\nIn trade and in in globalization but it's happening at digital pace\nIt's unprecedented and that's part of the anger that is filled American workers in the American people because they feel increasingly disenfranchised and shocked and shell shocked by it all\nUh and watch a lot of the voter that Donald Trump appealed to by the way it's also a voter the Bernie Sanders appeal to\nAnd it's out there it's also in the center you don't have to be on the right or left to feel that way government is not working in America folks and we know into some of the reasons why and what we have to do about it but the bottom line with us back to the climate changes we were trying to send a message in Paris to the private sector\nOne hundred and Ninety six countries are all going to move in the same direction at the same time and that creates the largest market the world has ever seen the energy market and why energy because energy is the solution to climate change\nThere's nothing we can do to change the course were on that isn't subject to making better decisions about how we create electricity what we do with our buildings how we burn oil or gas or coal and other things and how we moved to a renewable sustainable\nFuture the market that I knew in Massachusetts I represent Massachusetts twenty eight years we had a terrific tech base not quite Silicon Valley but\nIn the early years very very strong and still strong and we had a one trillion dollar market in the Nineteen nineties with with what a one billion users the energy markets\nGet in the Nineteen nineties with with what a one billion users the energy market is today four and five billion user market and a multibillion dollar market\nAnd it's going to grow to nine billion users and the next Thirty years is the biggest market the world has ever seen and by Donald Trump pulling out of Paris pulled us out of the position of leadership in the in that market\nSo but here's the rub this is why I said I'm going to be the skunk Paris goal was to keep the rise in the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade\nWe're probably right around one point three one point five already today we're right there but my friends in this century my grandchildren yours is going to live to experience\nA four degree rise in temperature for degrees is what we are on track to see now what you see barreling towards the coast and Carolinas today\nThe size of the storm intensity that repetitive with which it formed\nIs a direct consequence of the warming of the water and the increase of the moisture you have therefore in the air and therefore more rain\nHarvey Irma and Maria\nAll deposit it one storm Harvey alone deposit it as much water as flows over an I ever falls in an entire year\nFive days of flooding and Irma was the first armed to have a recorded one hundred and eighty five miles an hour is staying for\nTwenty four hours together these storms caused those two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the entire budget or the defense department and more money than the Commerce Department the Energy Department the education department the by the whole bunch of apartments together this isn't sanity insanity\nAs secretary of state I went to Norfolk, Virginia and the largest navy base in the world and we talked with the military but what they're having to do because\nOf the preparation they debate because of climate change and the rise of sea level I went to Antarctica because when I went to the art deco scientists near said Mr Secretary you got to go and our our ticket to really understand what's happening in terms of the changes I went to Antarctica\nAnd lo and behold yeah I heard from scientists room Seventeen different countries about the repetitive with which the west Antarctic ice sheet which is three and a half miles deep ice is melting and and shows a Fisher\nLarson ice sheet broke off larger than the size of the state of Rhode Island and floated out to sea and they're afraid that the whole thing may melt the right way we're going the Himalayan\nGlaciers are melting glaciers are disappearing\nAll over the world we're seeing the diminished ... of this cycle now you have an open seat in in the northwest passage in the summertime\nAnd people trying to exploited I mean it's changed last year for the first time in history\nWe're recorded above freezing temperatures in the Arctic in February so you know I get angry when I when I think about this\nDonald Trump's decision to pull out of that agreement is going to cost ... it just is as good a cost billions of dollars of damage to property and you're going to witness something a bit in the next ... hours next days but that's just the beginning\nWe've had an average of seven hurricanes a year since Nineteen Seventy two in the Atlantic which is more than normal and now they're two other hurricanes behind Florence that are sort of building out there so my friends what do you do about it\nWhat is the solution would be doing well I'll tell you what the president United States and if I were president today I Would have an emergency meeting of the G twenty\nI take the richest countries in the world and I said we're not leaving the room to we put together a climate action fund that helped less developed countries not have to build a coal fired power plant\nAnd we should stop every single coal fire power plant in the world from being ...\nThat's what we have to do why the dirtiest fuel in the world and it isn't a single biggest culprit with respect to global climate change and we're at a point now where we are locked in not just to preventing this from happening were locked into mitigation adaptation so we're going to have to do things like the Dutch do\nTo prevent see from coming into the country this below sea level but guess what a lot of other places have got to find that challenge already the mayor of Miami is pumping water out of Miami Beach and the mayor of Miami Beach that mine is pumping water out in order to\nGet sunny day high tide flooding out of the way\nSo we have water coming over the Boston or in in in Boston at the sea wall you know that comes in at a high tides any day now so my friends long answer to you but I got to tell you something this is one of the most serious issues we face is access central is solvable\nThere was no excuse for not moving more rapidly to alternative renewable energy solar is now completely competitive with ... it's cheaper than coal\n'cause there's no there's no truth in accounting I don't know how many of your business\nBut you know there's no truth in accounting and in this business today people say oh Cole is a three or four cents a kilowatt hour and solar is going to be sex and that was so ... solar is letting contracts in the world at two point nine cents per kilowatt hour and so forth but coal\nWhich it doesn't ever taken the cost\nOf coal sludge coal dust black lung moving it by train or trucks from wherever it comes from the burning the cost of emphysema the cost of of of you know the single biggest cost of children being hospitalized America during the summer is environmentally induced asthma\nWe spent fifty five billion dollars a year to deal with that and we can't find a hundred billion dollars to fund the ... ...\nSo I'm just telling you folks were the greatest democracy in the world we're not making choices about the future we've got to start to reclaim our democracy and reclaim our future by making real choices it's that simple [noise]\nThis is the commonwealth fund the California radio program you can learn more about coming\nSponsorship of the cake

I'm not being naive\nWe can make our democracy work but it is work it's hard work you have to go out and be part of it you have a you have to drive people to go vote you have to go vote yourself you've got to give money to campaign so it can compete you've got to take part in it\nAnd and ... and I just ask you remember the words of Ben Franklin\nWhen he walked down the steps of constitution hall after they had finished their labor on the next generation of the constitution the United states and a woman shouted at him Dr Franklin tell us what do we have and he said Dr oh she said do we have a monarchy or republic and he said a republic if you can keep it\nIf you can keep it that's the work of today as a kid you know\nJohn McCain you've talked about other colleagues in the Senate Republican and I all cross or at times you had a long relationship he leaves your fellow Vietnam veteran what do you have to say about John McCain and how how you worked with him and and your relationship with him over the years\nWhile I miss him as as I think America witness in because he was a a truth teller\nOr he knew he had some deviations himself one was on climate change when he's running for president because of the orthodoxy of this party and he was up front about those kinds of things which is one of the things people appreciate that about him but he had a as I wrote in an op that after he passed away he had a great capacity for forgiveness\nWhich is which is partly what you need and what we need and our politics a little bit in the country\nJohn and I didn't know each other and well when we went to the Senate I got to the Senate before John which I tried not to let him to get any given day as about two years apart and he came to campaign against me Massachusetts really never attacked me never mention my name and just talk to the other guy I write in the book about how that ... was the way the game was played back them not any more than\nBut in the Senate we were one day\nWe're on a delegation flying to Kuwait after the the Desert Storm and a ... Kuwait was just liberated and\nWe flew over to ah talk to the troops and thanked them but also to talk to the mirror and the other folks and see where we were going John and I were seated opposite each other he was flying backwards I was lying forward sitting opposite him\nWhich were assigned by seniority that's why it was important and I got there before\nUh and we started you know we we were uncomfortable little bit because I was the war protester and he was the W. so we started to talk about the navy or above navy guys and we both love the navy I Love the navy didn't like war of the love the navy\nAnd we talked about I I asked him about Annapolis was like to have a grandfather and a father\nFor star admirals the weight of that what did that affect them in the in the in the academy and blah blah blah\nSo we had an amazing conversation that night but out of it came a\nWillful determine commitment by the two of us which we made that night on that plane\nThat we were going to work together because we both agreed that the war was still tearing America part is Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Ninety One and so we decided we're going to work together to try to make peace peace with Vietnam\nAnd peace with ourselves in America and it began with the\nSort of ability to look beyond how we felt about each other's positions on the war he was pro war he he came back as an upset at the people who are protesting the war because his worst not the day was shot down Nineteen sixty seven and you have to hang on everything he had and believe for all those years in prison camp\nMy word was Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine\nAnd when I came back I got to go around the country and argue against the war so we came from very different places but my friends we we found the most amazing common ground we work together for ten years to try to change\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October ninth through November fourth ...
