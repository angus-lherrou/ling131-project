brandy ... I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and that\nIs the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusion so pay attention to your own Randy is now in her late thirties [noise] a few years ago her life unraveling at the time she around the dining services department at a senior living facility she'd been with a company that ran it for more than a decade one day\nShe made a mistake how has just in a rush to get home that was our because [noise] daycare clubs as I said I get off and size it was like maybe\nTen mile drive busy traffic area and I knew I had to pick up diapers and easiest thing for me I thought it would be to pick up my profile take the baby yet\nSo Brandi stopped at a store ran in and grab the diapers she's swipe your credit card at the self checkout station had reached out it turns out she used the wrong card not around by the company credit card\nThat was crazy is I didn't realize at that moment I didn't realize it sound mind supervisor come in and said hey let's just packages had she not said anything I don't think I Would have realized\nThat Randy county the card in case you needed to buy dining supplies or what should never had a problem before never been reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do and her response was well you\nKnow we have to determine nature and I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only like twelve month and she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate them play\nHas this crime and crime and like a day but then I couldn't believe that I didn't want to go home and tell my kids what had happened and I didn't want to\nTell my husband when an Avon I just didn't know what to do at that point\nI found like a ... I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide that a good example even though\nIt was a mistake brandy on more than her husband so they lost the job hit hard she found Lucia she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like looking takeoff meals but the stress grew brandy and her husband began fighting\nShe had supported him when he'd been laid off a few years earlier and she'd expected he'd do the same for her but he found his situation was different he'd been laid off brandy was fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake\nThe final argument was that um I left the house that morning I was going to chat interviews I had two interviews that day and I didn't practice toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet\nPaper when I came in with the kids who just immediate started yelling you can't keep yourself together you can't do this you can't do that so I walked right in fact out the door and I never looked back\nSomeone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if he'd buy two parents will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things you're paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework the of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper into horror next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do many people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be like in a conversation the lonely pushing might be so preoccupied with\nMaking a good impression that he can't\nPay attention to what's actually being set the conversation falters instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward or flat footed what happens as a result\nPeople do voice the composition of lists and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lands offers a new way of thinking about white people who\nFind themselves in scarcity seem to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take your south even deeper center says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty\nMake everyone less capable that it's the it's it's you\nAnd I tomorrow what are we to become poor or with all of a sudden have this seems like the poverty is and Simpsons changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some leading theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and out in ... wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers actually created a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after her as well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next\nYou have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched\nOther research that shows for example the farmers who are well off tend to read their feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short term thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity you have experienced\nOn Sundays we get to leave that for pm Sunday's we'd only tell one AM [laughter]\nAnd then you usually start the next day or night thirty or six in the morning it usually work eighty hours a week\n[noise] when we come back we'll find out how being overworked and exhausted can produce its own form of scarcity\nI'm Shankar Vedantam

short supply your brain tends to focus on that thing this focus can be so intense that impede your ability to think about anything else\nWhat happens when the thing you're missing is time when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to brief\nLet me tell you the story of a young woman named Katie she asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment\nFor as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with a note cards that there was a holiday party I bought the new cards and I also studied until two or three in the

grueling\nYou can get in at five thirty or six in the morning and you round on all your patients and then you you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and checking on their plan

day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I'd read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to\nTry to get in more exercise and I'm like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours walking or running outside are going to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working [noise] Fifteen hours and and trying to read and then go to sleep\nAs she focused intensely on to things she believed was key to her professional success [noise] Judy lost sight of things\nSponsorship of cake you read the live stream by

it's one and then what would it cost ten dollars\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise] but if you've ever being at least a little curious about the lives of the Hoover wealthy this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] real discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers none a lot about the private lives of that clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\nReal ... love come to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples are the kind of competition so people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their weapons managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager I Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins the series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get your stored it it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nThere can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets preferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some way to get to know their clients better than the ... own family or friends or even their own spots\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you've conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm telling me a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of person becomes the wealth manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter] so you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people\nWho would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack them around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva\nWho said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story so this is one of the first stories\nThat I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was\nWhile I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told the story of for lunch of receiving a phone call from a client who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it and the client didn't I\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Shepherd ...\nAnything remotely approaching the location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did it she she determine where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and dot the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are some times ah clients do make request like this not because you're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the client said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed the desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said on on your wealth manager not your fish longer and the clients I'd well today you're the fish monger and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory and Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story it I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had\nThe connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not asking the\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubles marriages and wait what children just like you know everybody else\nBut wealth you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or parents will ask of wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes to the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family\nThe big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues that lawsuit process and many countries makes public many many private documents that would reveal the extent in nature of the family's wealth all of which has had been carefully guarded secrets", "show_name":
