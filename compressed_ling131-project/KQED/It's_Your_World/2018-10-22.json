just bought a bottle of water and I'm the label is head gluten free interesting as well and it is [laughter] this is\nFood writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marched in describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time planted in one crop in endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um\nBut if you look in the late nineteenth early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our you know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and there's nothing else about corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels Ehsan ... and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nWe got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products is could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there are fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought at any store not to run a good but they were there most mom's cooking\nStore not that they were any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad by the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of food like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself lights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and like what you're saying earlier a lot of that has to do with with the fact that ... ... ... we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know this didn't go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want to mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it to NATO you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word ... and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are and I'm going for you need to everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you are a food to eat like I think of Mark Bittman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the basics the before six and\nA few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time in and do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because no matter broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animal but of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that class and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not that\nThe fact the animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not orange craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not\nLess and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at Penn dot com um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for dinner and I I take one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nRight I don't care about the great in sardines are great how can you not eat pasta why the hell you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is we shouldn't have come a bouncing pastas gonna kill ya\nOkay so am I getting that saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but they have to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate it Seventy four percent I Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store has been spike\nSponsorship that the cake you eat the life's dream bike Kennedy from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X Kennedy on demand\nSo why the hell you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which shouldn't Haley of calm a housing pastas Julia\nOkay some marketing in saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you have to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate at Seventy four percent ... Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert ... he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco\nSo there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... you know the general them or are that's even has the most famous now\nApple puree or evaporated change yeah my favorite because changes oh you know students healthy guy yeah what happens when you evaporate change if you get sugar [noise]\nAnd then Tuesday much the same towards the end of the week will get a little bit of a few degrees warmer in our temperatures lots of sunshine after the morning they were cast burns off its ... public radio good morning\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from like fuck life lock with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber criminals learned more life lock dot com [noise]\nFrom twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio and from the doors do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development awards support ...\nOn today and then Tuesday mentioned this same towards the end of the week will get a little bit of a few degrees warmer temperatures lots of sunshine after the morning they were cast burns off its ... public radio good morning\nSupport for the head radio our comes from life luck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber criminals learned more life lock dot com [noise]\nFrom twenty for you and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nAnd from the doors do charitable foundation who is clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR and guy Raj and I'm sure today food why we eat what we eat and\nWhy our food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates\nWe all think we taste food and ... and yet that's an illusion in the sense that uh most of what you're tasting the fruit to the floor let me see the Hubble the to the smoky are actually being dictated by nostrils but our brain is doing is wonderful ... and ... and the information I get from my nose and makes me believe it's coming from I ...\nThis is Charles Spence of the crust Myrtle research the birth rate at Oxford University\nWhat is the cross motor research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... so lab right here in the psychology department where we look at how the census interacts\nAndme yes our mouth and nose interact when we eat the mouse and our years\nWe didn't experiment where we're feeding people potato chips and each time they've been into a potato chip we would change this island they could sometimes making their own\nCrunching ...

groups that\nTrump says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might ... white wine ... with an odorless tasteless food dye\nAnd they've done appropriately you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into having leaving tasting what they think because of red wine all the rumors are near the other to walk out in the dark chocolates from the state and fruit since I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about\nThe ingredients here's Charles stats on the stage\nAhead It's MORNING I'll tell you about the perfect meal\nWorld convinced we can have the food we enjoyed the flavors ... of the wind in the blast\nBut if I was going on it's created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question how to study how the measure is\nI'm a tendency among the scientist that been your guest problem is is this thing people like your eye and a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain light up with that kind of your brain on flavor or New York astronomy running is one problem here which is that in fact it measures up more of these brain scan it kind of lie on your back\nWith your head ... spelled with a juvenile ... periodically square in a some drink you call what have you thought you had all kind of a jolt and that ... that the brains of gum alignment but it's kind of tells you something useful but doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal is one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal [laughter]\nI was actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be able to make very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as us the best meals about ... what I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nOr no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting without Padma say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with us and resonate them then you can have quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed you are ... their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a a holiday and they say oh you've got to try to using red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon how the names that we've all learned versions of it I'm\nLike what kinds of programs all rose a paradox so used to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill the guy for that so holidays to the Mediterranean or not sitting somewhere on a on the side of the sea sipping not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not tasteless like the bachelor I said why you've ever had so great that you wanted to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have in and you bring it back and then you just wanted\nYour friends are like this is really cheap birthday yeah as you say well how is it something about when the Balkans when they're playing with a cold you know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat more drink no we're always somewhere in certain environments in certain states of\nMind on all mental state environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're texting and how much we enjoy it and we saw in a way some myths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\n... pleasure into what we think about food\nIn fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out\nSponsorship that the cake you weedy life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X Kennedy on demand\nFood tastes good isn't a bad mood I ain't never tasted good\nIs this illusion about flavor we think we're taking the wind the glass but I'll break has brought me everything else doesn't allow him to the ... the smell of assault in the ... the walls of the San ... all of that is playing in the ... on top chef capturing that insight or in the dishes or\nAny of that too much to install restaurant in that I Am Switzerland tuition and star restaurant a white\nTablecloths has no ... on the table was no glasses or and I play nothing there's just a plastic car people wait and see what he calls me seven o'clock hour here on everyone's hands restaurant knocking people will tables full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up seriously that plastic how I Wonder if they get up you know the\nLittle one euro tower and it makes it moving found in sort of some of those type of it that will be laughing\nI can guarantee within a minute you'll have a whole
