Roscoe researched how states are chop has learned to care for his two thousand a book about Chavez from University of New Mexico press sweat\nWhen Senator was asked like who is really your inspiration for learning about nonviolence he always pointed back and said that it was his mother\nAnd the practices of his mother she would uh at that time would try to prepare meals for homeless people in the community she would do try to do acts of charity and so forth\nAnd so from a very early age he says that he was a a brought up in the idea of service to people who were needy\nAntonio you mentioned to life altering counters that phage are China's had won with father Donald McDonald who was the parish priest in labor organizer\nAnd he said that he instigated says our love of reading and passion for non violence so one of the um individuals that say John next read the books was saint Francis has a ... seat\nWhen he finally met a father McDonald the idea was that\nHe was brought into kind of a formal education and the kinds of practices that he had already been doing so learning about St Francis he started learning about what it means to deepen those practices of non violence and how that ties into the question about faith and the love of God\nA but it was something that he had already been living from an early childhood to his mother's practices or this kind of the folk Mexican American Catholicism which was really really deep and his family\nIs there anything about St Francis a story that we might need to now to understand the connection to peace and and violence sometimes that story\nI I think that was something that was a really impactful for assess are about St Francis was the connections to a nature and to\nAh animals in particular so St Francis always believed that it was important to in some sense right commune with nature and think of nature as a living breathing whole system are sort of pre kind of ecological consciousness and think about\nNature as a being that we must uh being relationship with animals are themselves sentient beings who have personalities and lives in thoughts that we can take into account in our own lives\nAnd I think that this impacted sets are into understanding and appreciation that nature is not just natural resources but it's something that we have to take into account at something that nurses us that feeds us that is part of our own lives and bodies\nAnd uh I think quite frankly this probably affected his own decisions later on in life to become a vegetarian he was quite honored uh later on in life for um emphasizing that a peaceful nonviolent life means one about treating animals Whelan humanely in various ways and so for him that meant that he had to become a vegetarian\nIt sounds like also that there was something that his dreams that St Francis and also dining out really impacted hands [noise]\nYeah I think that part of it was that he saw connection a much greater connection up from his own experiences to these other uh folks around the world he was able to see\nUh this kind of idea of service to the least advantaged in society was something that was part of a much broader human experience from Gandhi and from reading thorough\nHe was also able to see that this was a political practice and this was more than just about charity but it was about trying to understand how power structures create a disadvantaged people and uh that we can work to change those power structures\nSuch as this also net Fred ... she was an organizer who became is I guess like non friend and mentor

of non violence\nIn your book he said that delaying a great strides serves as the contacts for say shocked to develop his tactics and his vision of non violent direct action\nWell the uh the the dilemma strike was really the the sort of the initial a a struggle for the burgeoning a United farmworkers\nAre that are started in a you know Nineteen sixty two Nineteen sixty three ... et cetera Travis was an organizer for for profit organization for about ten years and so he\nHad a stability as an organizer he had a steady income and a house in a car and several children to take care of\nNow what's the striking thing about since our Chabris is that search has decided to give all of that up to try to form the farm workers\nSo he gave up all of the stability and security to try to work for people that he felt were being ignored even by an organization like a this community services organization so he he sort of fits this kind of a story of\nA of a self made man or the person who takes the risk and risks at all or to try to fulfill requests and the quest was working for the social justice of the the farm workers\nAnd so he gave that all up in for about two years or so he and and uh Helen Chivers his wife and the low to sweat the work together with no money other than the savings that they put together to try to build a farm workers union or a ... amongst the Filipino and the Mexican American workers and the Central Valley of California\nThe grape strike was in some sense they're first effort to build solidarity and what was really unique about the the the strike I think is the way in which it was more than just a pure labor strike\nBut it turned into a social movement it turned into a rallying calls for Mexican Americans in California to see\nSolidarity between the farm workers and young Chicano since you got us in the cities and uh also with a folks in other parts of the country who started to see that the conditions under which farm workers were the struggling with in California that people who are producing food that they were eating\nA were abysmal and that they needed to uh as consumers of that food to get on board\nSo what I think the grape strike represents is an attempt to try to expand I'm a labor struggles beyond that into real big social movements that involve students and consumers and intellectuals and the workers themselves into a movement for social justice well\nWhat we did it again organizing at people and communities we have ... them at the time of the house all the way to New York city and Chicago and to Canada again ...\n... ... to speak to\n'em or labor union and that means that they had community organizations\nAnd just getting people to support and not by not that great big margin that week I organizing people to set a picket lines impending stars\nAnd when they would pick up their stores all of these kids that came out to help us\nThen and just started to take the grapes of wrath so eventually be able to get the major teams are actually take the greats out of all of these stores and that and get people to stop buying they've solved together to begin a huge movement in Philly had millions of people\nLiterally all of the United states it stopped eating and not only the United states but also in Canada\nThe United states but also in Canada and Mexico and of course in Europe\nWhile I remember reading for me it was a very vivid picture of\nA sit ins in Chicago right in the middle of a store inside the store sit ins and these were in the um big change so that that really had to take a ... a bit of courage on the part of those who are participating\nYesterday and many of those or housewives where there were students that they were just people out there in the cities and they came forward to\nTo support the farm workers but again you have to go back to the organizing part of it is it just didn't didn't happen if I'm going out there and made this happened you know like I said by speaking and recruiting people getting people to to support us on those picket lines so that was very exciting\nCould you take us through let's say an argument to or even one person who you were trying to convince not divide grapes someone who really couldn't understand what what would you say to them\nMost of the most part people are very sympathetic in in the message that simple you know we

like a one room house but then every time we would go up north we would come back\nAnd that another room to the house until we had you know what two or three bedroom home and that's mainly the life as

Ross\nWe're organizing this area so that farmworkers could have like you know toilets in the fields are safe drinking water would would ban the use of the shorthand the whole would um would have like the minimum wage was at that time was like a dollar forty\nSo they joined in in uh in um in Seventy nine I think he was in February I still have his union\nMembership card this way I remember those days\nI Know there was a big convention that had happened there was a it was the first one\nThat's the one that's the very first one it was fabulous yeah it was a momentous event yes it was it was it was hundreds of delegates in a very very first farm worker convention ever in a in South Texas A M and probably in the whole state of Texas\nWhen he developed as ... remember seeing ... for the first time\nI was volunteering or at the union I remember him telling us some of the things that needed to be done here so that we could win those changes so that we could make those changes and I remember telling them but we don't even have water and I caught on yeah because we didn't have water yet and we ... we don't even have pay streets and we don't have\nYou know all of the very basic necessities\nAnd him saying sort of telling us well we know that talk to you it is it is it is your responsibility to he says at the end of the day I can go back to California and who's going to live without water and who's going to live without the ... street so that the bus could pick you up for school\nAt the time maybe with it was like\nWow if he thinks we can do it what impressed me was him believing that as farm workers I could do something really to have an impact on our lives he sell something and all of us before we saw it in us ourselves I don't know that sort of confusing better when I'm trying to say is that she had face\nBecause he had worked for farm workers in California he knew the power that we could have and so when he did that when he told us that\nAnd not only one time but many times over about what we could do and then when we started to work on it and then we started to win and then we started to totally believe and set you know what\nHe stepped suddenly right if we help fit this world we have a lot of power and we also need to have that respect\nThey're married many wonderful memories of changes that have been made but but they also have come through a lot of sacrifice and some scars that remain\nYou know and people's hearts and memories for um for a lifetime but it's something that has to be recognized by everyone is that those that are in the fields that bring those food to to the stores\nWe need to think about them every time we eat because it is because of them and so we need to make sure that that we work so that the laws that are now affected our um\nOur respect that and that they are enforced\nHe talk briefly about the forces that move June inspired you to do the work that you're doing for your organization now you're the executive director and believe of um of loop pay\nWhich is ... and ... union of all the people yes in other words you talked about how you in a sense you're carrying on the work of on stage are Thomas in United farm workers\nI think that you know through all of the valuable lessons not only from ...\nFrom um the farm workers themselves\nWilling to take a risk and say things have got to beat their friends we've got to work towards a\nChanging some of this last we've got to make life better for our um for our children are some of the the same you know philosophy uh that's that's I have a cat still carries on it's part of our culture and the work that we do is learning from from the work that they did\nLearning and and respecting what they did to bring us up to this point and feeling a responsibility of making sure that that it is I moved into the future that while they're still remains\nA injustices in the field or in the communities that we've got to continue that work that they'd be that they started\nThat is on their shoulders that we stand all of our programs here a little bit for example one of the big core values their self help and we just believe that if you if we live the problem that we can be part of that solution\nBecause we know we we feel it and we are going to feel the impact of the change and therefore we've got to be involved\nThat's Juanita ... Cox and continues to look out for farm workers issues\nOut for farm workers issues in the south Texas area where she grew up in a migrant farm working family in the Nineteen fifties and sixties\nWhat's interesting is that typically ah when you talk about nonviolence you have this kind of litany of heroes that are engaged in violence so people will say oh you're Tolstoy thorough Gandhi Martin Luther king and sometimes I'll mention ... or the lord is worth it but\nUh I think that China's a offers a A N and his practice in it and the way he talked about nine nonviolence was very very different from the way in which for instance Gandhi and Martin Luther king thought about the effectiveness of non violence\nMore now from Carol bosses conversation with Jose Antonio Roscoe Oregon State university professor and says our job is scholar\n[noise] Gandhi's nonviolence was based on this uh is sort of Hindu principal of ... or non violence\nAnd forgotten that meant that when you practice non violence it's an all encompassing world view about not harming another individual and so that means that you try to engage in not harming anyone mentally spiritually and physically\nAnd practically speaking that meant that when Gandhi would organize a protest or a demonstration or act of civil disobedience he thought it was very important for the protesters to a inform the authorities thoroughly about what they were planning to do\nSo uh there was pre notification of what was going to be going on how the protesters were going to be engaging in civil disobedience so that there were no surprises\nThat there are no secrets and that everyone was above board but that they would know that civil disobedience was going to take place and for Gandhi this he believe that this was important to be completely transparent\nIn your actions to those who you consider to be your opponents\nChavez was much different than that uh he believed I think what we might call more in a in a politics of disruption um\nTactics that would be disruptive to the status quo that would get tension going on a but we're not necessarily all above board so to speak so for instance during the grape strike the uh the farmworkers engaged in what was called the blindness that book to go which translates to a a turtle plans [noise]\nUm and so what this meant practically was that farmworkers would a plan to work very slowly picking the grapes\nAnd is anyone who's ever uh worked in great part of his nose that the temperatures in the valley in California get very very hot and grapes are very very fragile and if they're not picked at the right time and the right way uh they can be essentially just useless uh for production\nAnd so what the farm workers would do would they would work very slowly and not I'm not harvest as quickly as necessarily threatening\nTo destroy a many growers harvests and the attempt here was to try to of course the worker that growers to come to contracts\nOr another tactic was something that they called somebody knows submarines in other words a because in many cases the the farm workers had been prohibited from picketing near the farms and near the growers are homes\nOr they didn't have any access to the workers in the fields to try to organize and to join a union", "show_name": "It's Your World", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "05"}
