{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KQED", "content": "... San Francisco and kick you we are north high blood in Sacramento ... my mind that cake you weedy dot org good morning I'm Michael states that two o'clock\nFrom cake you read the public radio in San Francisco you're listening to walls and bridges a special series of conversations from cake you B.D exploring some of the most polarizing topics of our time I'm Jeremy Siegel\nZIP Code is much more than just a five digits number most obviously it tells you where to fend postage where a person lives and works\nBut the impact of that number can reach far beyond geographic location it can reveal inequality and the likelihood of upward mobility in different locations and medical professionals have begun to consider ZIP Code as an indicator of how wellbeing and even life expectancy\nIn today's program we'll hear a panel of experts to discuss whether it zipped code can determine a person's faith in\nThe program was recorded on may seven to ... opera house in San Francisco\nIn conversation where Dr Tony ... senior vice president for healthy communities at the California down then David J Harding professor of sociology at UC Berkeley and the Leila butler associate director of policy wink here's our host for tonight's program kick you would you Silicon Valley bureau chief Tanya mostly\n[noise]\nStart off by talking a little bit about this idea as ours that code and the premise the big idea that I can determine our fate and a\nDoctor in researching for tonight and I found a lot of work\nA lot of research a pending down counties ... your word finds that we can do even more granular even more narrower and see disparities block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood can you expand upon now [noise]\nYeah um and again thanks for having me\nOr you know use it is more important than your genetic code when it comes to your house that was the catchy slogan that a number of us developed a number of years ago\nAnd the reasons we say chips ZIP Code in genetic code is because it's a catchy slogan but the reality is you can go down ... much below ZIP codes and we went down to the census tracks or in Alameda County and then around the entire state in fact we've looked at every since distracting the California\nTo see significant differences between census tracts are more proxies of neighborhoods you can see significant differences between neighborhoods or even contiguous neighborhoods and the same city in Oakland for instance\nThere's a twenty two year life expectancy difference between a flat land and the hills and when when we ran that entire analysis for the bay area we\nCould actually tell people that twelve twelve thousand five hundred dollars of household income buys you a year of life or in the San Francisco bay area for each additional twelve thousand five hundred dollars of household income so we started telling people\nYou should bring this kind of data when you're negotiating a race I mean you\nLiterally I should say hey boss I Need a couple more years to live here you know show me\nWe laugh at that but the reality is that that many people don't have that privilege to be able to ask for that and many of these areas that you're talking about\nUm this comes for you on this work you're at a place where you've been studying this for many years but the genesis for you really came early on and you actually were raised\nIn Canada is that correct and it was and you came to the United states and you said what the heck like what's going on there and can you just tell us a little bit about some of those disparities that you saw right away\nYeah so I'm a very simple person in my life story was pretty straightforward I grew up in Canada in Montreal Canada it's it's a wonderful city that hosted the Olympic Games in the international world's fair and as universal health care and universal childcare and subsidize postsecondary education um\nAnd paid leave for everybody it's it's a very civilized country that invested its people\nAnd that's they status to ... as the investment\nThat that the investment and I I didn't know it at the time I assumed all western developed countries invested in people\nUh someone I had a choice of going to medical school I went to Johns Hopkins medical school which is in east Baltimore, Maryland and landed in Baltimore in east Baltimore and was literally shocked and I was being toured around by an upper class men\nAnd he saw this look good shock on my face and he said what's what's wrong with you and all I could manage to stay on route was when was there a war here because I couldn't understand there were blown up houses burned out cars up on jacks\nMangy dogs running around in babies playing in and amongst all of this and I'll never forget what he said to me because it's it it set me on a career trajectory that took me to where I Am today he said to me with this look of disdain he said what you expect if the inner city\nAnd I thought so I'm the idiot I should have expected this\nBlight I should have known that this is a norm\nIn the United states because where I grew up you don't have inner cities but in this country you have inner cities and so I was I was set on this trajectory medical school because I felt like I was being asked to do an absurd things I was being asked to treat social ills\nI was bringing us to do an absurd things I was bringing us to treat social ills with pills and it made very little sense to me and so that's sort of what led me to do these analyses that show these ridiculous life expectancy gaps\nIn some cities the United states is Thirty years between neighborhoods in the same city\nAnd those are places typically the south typically the east\nAnd the south east the mid west everywhere we look we've looked at over thirty cities now everywhere reflect we've never found a life expectancy difference in the same city less than Fifteen Years\nIn some cases over Thirty years this is the American pattern and it's it's uniquely American not that you don't have differences and other parts of the world you don't have the extremes\nThat you have in America elsewhere in the developed\nWorld you're shaking your head and I'm your work has taken you to these spaces as well and these disparities that we see a really at the granular level um\nWhen you think about some of the things that you do on the ground what are some of the things that you see out there some of the disparities that impact specifically here in the bay area\nWell I'm One of the things I just wanted to say is that I always I'm really\nI'm reticent about talking after Tony heightened because he always is a bad stories and break it down so easily sell\n'em but every time it always reminds me that something that I grew up with something that was normal for me was is actually not normal our expectations are actually not um this expectation that the inner city where people live that that's I'm just that way\nThat's actually not where we should be operating but there is a way to get out of it and so that was the work that's what drove me to my work\nUm when we think about some of the things that we see and how it plays out um in communities\nI think you put it so eloquently when you said you know if you have access to a park safe place to be active if you have access to healthy food if you have access to quality education or if you can easily get to work or contribute in your community then you're going to be healthier\nAnd we see that play out and many communities where um we're working where the opposite is happening where there's a lack of access to these important resources these opportunities the opportunity to live our full is life\nAnd to contribute and it has a deep impact on health and it actually has an impact on society overall\nUm because when we know that ... you know our fates are inextricably linked we are all connected\nAnd so how we treat folks that um are experiencing the most inequities in our communities and that it speaks volumes to\nHow we treat everyone in a society and how we can benefit most is by thinking about and working closely with people who had a deep that in the center of those um inequities people who are dealing with these\nUm challenges and have been cut off from opportunity day to day to ask what are the solutions in order to change that surrounds so that we too can benefit\nI'm In the ways that people are benefiting in Montreal and living healthy lives\nBut one thing I'm hearing you say um is that we have to have a certain sense of connective ness with each other and empathy and perhaps in this country capitalism and this idea of pulling yourself from your bootstraps and every man for himself\nHas set up a culture where we're not thinking of each other that way um I like to bring you and David and your thoughts on this idea of the root of the disparities that we see\nShore yeah and I think we definitely have a very individualistic culture here in the U.S uh and so we tend to attribute people's outcomes and experiences the choices they made and sort of ignore the larger structures of things we're talking about and I think\nWe're really talking if we're talking about the amount of concentrated poverty we have in the U.S and US cities but also in rural areas\nWe're talking about poverty and we're talking about race right that is what are the way this country has dealt with race in our history of racial oppression and domination is what is what led us to this point I\nCan understand one thing about capitalism because I it's a question that comes up a lot and I just like to point out that you know sweetness a capitalist country Denmark has capitalist country Finland Norway Canada they all managed to have\nUm communities in Atlanta um you know they took a neighborhood that was really in the sort of extreme\nNinety nine percent tile up all the adversity that you could think of crime you know high school dropouts social services foster care everything was going wrong and they\nYou know they they basically tore down the house and they built a mixed um income village really with uh amenities and it was very attractive and they've seen\nAll of those statistics reverse themselves and they've done it in multiple parts of the country so it's it's clearly doable it works the question is\nWill we invest enough money to build housing at scale to be able to address the scale of the problem that we're facing in California were about a million and a half units short of where we need to be and you know we're falling behind it by about a hundred thousand units a year\nSo you know on in terms of scale and there was an effort recently in the legislature to actually change some of the density um zoning that would allow transit hubs to build much higher density and um\nAll the politicians walked away from it because it was an election year so there are real political issues here people consider this issue is sort of central even colleagues of mine said that these are issues were were\nDemocrats sound like Republicans are because they say well it's up to the market um and so there's a I still think it comes down to this question about human rights you know housing a human right I mean we have people living on the streets\nAre are are we okay with that is that okay because that's not going to go away by us wishing it away it's only going to go away by us investing in housing at a at a very large scale\nTo increase the volume of opportunities for people to be house and we have to intervene in the market market will not solve this problem\nOr we anywhere close to that there's lots of effort that are happening on the legislative level there's lots of folks on the ground who are working in this vein but\nThere's a terror that a lot of people feel and the day to day and it doesn't feel like they're any solution that are anywhere near getting to the numbers that you just brought up\nWell LA just passed a huge housing bond it's not enough but it's the biggest thing that they've ever done and they're trying to invest it in the hot spots in in Los Angeles there's definitely a lot of political interest I think people\nAre afraid during an election year or two kind of raise their head up too high on this issue\nI'm a number of the gubernatorial candidates who suggested that they're very interested in trying to actually get this thing to scale so I'm hopeful that things will happen I think in California there's there's sort of a percolating will to actually address this problem but it's it can't be addressed through the market alone yeah you're shaking your head\nEnemy enemy in the conversation right now I think at the top of our mind this idea around housing I also thinking about connection to opportunity and um this idea around just access to health foods this idea has really investing in communities in every community\nUm and ... to go back to David's point about choice in this conversation that sometimes comes up about ...\nI think it's important that talk about what options and the limited choice there is start their first before we talk about\nI think it's important to talk about what options and the limited choice there is start their first before we talk about um you know I agree with David point before we talk about what choices people are making really start talking about the policies that got us there\nUm and got us to a point where people are living in just invested community so what would it take I think when we all close our eyes and think about what it looks like if we have an equitable society\nWe don't think about having some communities that have been some have not we really think about everyone having access to a helpful community where everybody can live they can drive that can contribute they can have access to opportunity\nAnd so what does it take to invest in order to get us there so when I'm nodding to um a lot of what I'm uh my fellow panelists are talking about it really is this idea of like what does it take to get us\nTo move our politicians to listen to our communities who are just asking for just that give us that those opportunities um those I'm really you know the communities that are healthy and invested in so that people can live their best labs\nYeah I think that I Want to talk to you a little bit about some of the groundwork you dead in the outcomes and some of the um\nThe experiences of the young people that you talk to you and when we think so much about communities and opportunity we're thinking about the future of the young people who are living in those communities on your work and your research found\nUm really the impacts of violence and poverty overtime for young people tell us a little bit about that\nI worked with a study to a group of boys in three different neighborhoods in Boston are too high poverty neighborhoods and won a low poverty neighborhood which was\n... served as a comparison and I just started by talking about what their daily lives where like where did they go who to interact with why did they do they do those things what were their experience was like\nA and I was kind of naive going and I didn't have this violence in mind I mean I knew that the neighborhoods they lived in were the most violent ones in the city I'm ... but immediately what what what came out was that the way the violence was structured or many many things about their lives\nUm it's structured how they thought about the institutions they came into contact with the experience of being\nUm both living in a in a in a violent neighborhood where you're constantly afraid that you were going to be\nVictimized or and then at the same time you know having to police come in and sort of turn you upside down and put you off against the wall and then that led to a kind of institutional distrust would spread to other institutions you know many kids said well the teachers at school they're just like the cops\nOr a you know they would see you know they go into ... or something like that right I'm someone from from outside of the ... community perhaps um you know we also saw um them having to make very hard choices about how\nHow to how to keep themselves safe like they would make decisions about who they were friends with\nWho they spent time with based on the capacity of those people to to help keep them safe rather than the capacity of those people to help them achieve their long term goals they all had\nThe long term goals you'd expect of every American get I Want to go to college I'm going to have a job I'm going to have a family in a house\nUm they subscribe to those things but the pathways that getting there was just very hard for them or to figure out because of the needs to navigate their their basic survival on a daily basis\nDoctor I and I want to talk to you about um two things so that drip drip and that's the only way that I can describe it but like the day to day stress of living and that type of stress\nThe recent research that we saw around on mortality rack rates of black women giving childbirth\nAnd how the research is finding just\nRacism is like the drip drip that leads to these outcomes of early death\nWhat are some solutions on the ground level we're talking so high up you know policy changes collectively as a society we can invest more but the real realization is like that it's not going to happen overnight\nSo what are some of the more practical things that we're seeing and that we're doing and that we can do to reverse this thing\nWell that's that's one of the most important questions in his work and I you know I'm privileged to be able to work with a group of people who's trying to actually intervene in that in a way that actually enhanced with people's sense of self worth\nLet me just start by saying that you know just to make it very clear about the date on racism it's very powerful um when you look at the outcomes of African American women in childbirth or a infant mortality we have some of the worst outcomes\nWhen you look at the outcomes of African women African immigrant women to this country they have some of the best\nAnd as the culture eat their health gets worse and it's true of Latino immigrants it's true of white European immigrants\nEvery immigrant group is healthier when they get here than their American born counterpart in as a a culture become American their health gets worse America is not good for your health so that's a it's a perfect test of racism as\nA determinant of health if you've got African immigrant women coming here and having good birth outcomes and then as a culture it getting worse what's happening to them as the Americanized variants racism\nSo we've simplified this work into\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream bike has said Jim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or opium theater at the gym at ... dot com\nAnd an organization spending a billion dollars for ten years to try to change those conditions and we've simplified our strategy to ABC I mean I talked to were set free than ABC so a stance for agency an agency is a sense\nOf control over the things that happen too many people typically low income people feel that they have very little control over\nThat you know hasn't it very DNA racism it's it's built into our institutions and those institutions operate according to that software and we can only do that in California has recognize that the results of that had been profound\nFour and a half million people got health insurance under the Affordable CARE Act mostly through medical um that's more than any other state it's more than most states combined\nWe have a million people who can re classify they're low level felonies as misdemeanors under prop forty seven and fifty seven we have two hundred and eighty thousand undocumented California to get full scope health insurance\nThrough Medicare all that and we're now pushing to get that up to age twenty six\nYou know we have cut the rate of high school suspensions and expulsions even half including for African American Latino Native American kids who have this proportionality\nAfrican American Latino Native American kids who have just proportionality and in some of our major school districts Fresno Los Angeles that is heading toward zero\nThat is unprecedented during a time where other big states are going up and this is a product of a narrative of inclusion and California which says we all have to invest in each other this can't just be you know every man for himself so I think the story in California is a good story now the media\nTends to like\nConflict\nAnd I think that one of the frustrations that many of us have\nIs that the stories are always told about who's fighting with each other as opposed to sort of talking about sort of what's changed what's improved California actually there's a recent journal the American Medical Association report that came out just last week\nWhich was California in terms of its overall health status went from number twenty two in the country to number three\nBetween Nineteen Ninety six and two thousand and six\nYear old media in the world like\nNobody's nobody's talking about it so I I think that that the difficulty with the media is that you're often\nForced to tell this portrait story tell a story about a person and this person sort of interaction with all of these things and you often have a difficult time telling the landscape story yeah you know about what are those policies of sort of institutional\nInteraction so that people are contending with that are making their lives less healthy and I think that you know NPR kick you need is a beautiful job of telling a landscape story with a portrait embedded in it and then if more people told the story that you told I think we would be better educated\nSo I Do have a question about education but I Want to honor\nPerson here who is the first to come up\nTo the question I have two questions am is actually a great segue because my question was related to education and I don't know the details about this I I my understanding I surface I don't have\nKids but I have heard about in San Francisco I'm a lottery system for where the schools that kids can go to you and then they're they're about to different locations and my understanding of the intention was to\nTo have kids have different opportunities in different locations which then they would benefit from these other schools and\nYou want to hear your thoughts on that and do you feel that it's been effective way to have that and she outcome that women had that\nI can offer I mean I used to live in San Francisco I have kids in San Francisco\nI'm you know the fundamental problem is housing segregation I mean that's the that's the underlying problem\nAnd what the school system is trying to do is is it simply retrofit um you know some sort of inclusion every policy or you know integration policy on top of this rigid policy of housing segregation by race and by class\nAnd so it's an awkward retrofit but it's a necessary retrofit because as much data his adjusted I'm Ross charity who's done it at UC Berkeley prior at UC Berkeley even Harvard now Stanford or did this wonderful studies showing that young people in um low income high adversity communities\nIf they move at a relatively young age they essentially a crew the benefits of the better community if they move at a young age but for each year that they stay in that\nLow income community um they lose that benefit if they move and by the age we're about Thirteen or fourteen and there's no benefit to moving from on high adversity community to ah you know a wealthy community\nSo fundamentally what the schools are trying to do is is trying to pull kids out of an environment that is you know adverse and and mix them with other kids that aren't experiencing so much at first but they're trying to retrofit a fundamentally racist pattern that it's been laid down across the United states\nReceive that research shows that integration works when it comes to education and the outcomes um to even by saying as painful as it as it was in the late seventies all the way through to the nineties we actually see great outcomes from the students who are back to those areas you want it to\nWhat I wanted to say is that if you call it a retrofit I Would call it a band aid I think that the\nTrue um I\nThe true solution to think about how to invest in those schools that are in the communities where people are\nSo for example schools are not just the place or they don't have to be just a place where children go to you know go to class and then they leave we invest in schools do our taxes so there is that you know the playground or the gyms or you know all of these different resources that are within schools\nUm that can be used more by communities if\nThey're better invested in and so if we have mixed income communities and then we have schools that are invested in instead of having to have this band data bussing students to different schools then we have our places right there in the community where we live in order to be connected to opportunity to anticipate thrive\nAnd so I think while it might have some good outcomes to start the real question is how do we really get back to those neighborhoods that need investment most and again start to invest right there um in those communities\nActually and discussion in the discussion on the notion that mix communities like economically mix communities which I guess are are sort of cipher for racially ethnically mixed communities the resources floated those communities and the outcomes are positive\nFor for all I think that's that's very true but I think the point you just made that there were lots of reasons that communities may not be economically\nMixed and yet the outcome should there should be that opportunity to have that positive outcome anyway because the other implication is that I think we're the ... the the reverse implies that\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream bike has said Jim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November boards that the U.S say Chen or freedom theater at the gym at death dot com\nA percentage of white people to which the resources flow and that that to me is one of the a\nSerious endemic problems\nIt shouldn't be that way it should be every community regardless of\nWhat it looks like\nHuman down to the the voting precinct level that there should be an equal outcome and I think the the ACC approach says a lot about that but but the uh belonging changing the odds\nAnd I guess the first one was agency agency should exist in every single community it shouldn't just we\nCan't wait for the big social engineering changed to result and suddenly we now have a housing integration throughout this country because I think that's that's going to take a long time here forever thank you\nI'm a huge fan of both and the idea of you know thinking about ways to T H communities that are mixed income communities and also thinking about how to invest deeply and communities of color and linked to me it low income communities until we get to that place\nThat you know people get scared like what he's talking about that that just somehow like socially and anyway so I actually\nI think that you have to believe in democracy to do this work you have to believe in the power of optimize democracy to actually use these kinds of outcomes and so\nIn communities where there are ... and it's not just the schools I mean these are communities where there's lacking is lacking healthy food and some cases you're lacking potable water um you know virtually every institution is on life support in many of these communities that's no accident\nThat's because those communities are perceived as essentially being politically weak and not having the agency to change the political dynamics\nAnd so building power at the end of the day to allow communities to hold those institutions accountable it's not a panacea but it's a it's a critical element of repairing not just\nYou know the school but repairing the democracy because we we literally don't facilitate the voice of people in Bay view hunters point who have to deal with you know the shipyards and toxins and you know adverse land uses day in day out why\nI mean they're in the same city as knob hill and and what not there in the same policy regime there just perceived as less valuable and we have to change that perception\n\nAre there areas that you also see you've talked about these great programs that are happening the fresh food programs on", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Your World", "city":
