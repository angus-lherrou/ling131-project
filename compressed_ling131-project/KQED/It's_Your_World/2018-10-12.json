rules that carry most of the power especially political economic power\nBut before we leave deep time I had one more question for Meg donkey in El ... and that was why did the patriarchy happen\nYou mean what was the motive why did the men of ten thousand years ago I Want to see the upper hand at the expense of the women and their lives yeah I mean what a jerk move catch a jerk move you all have been making ever since\nAnd here's how Mick cocky answer the why question\nSome people will argue that men need to tell themselves or want to be in charge because they are left out of the whole reproductive process really in terms of being the ones\nThat can create life and uh even if people are informed that can't happen without their sperm nonetheless it's a huge cultural difference is in many societies the creation and perpetuation of life is a really big deal right\nSo guys have insecure Ito well because of what his amazing thing that women can do that they can't do things you can't

though Mel Conner thanks womb envious real he says there's a simple reason men built the gender hierarchy and put themselves in the top spot\nThe most basic explanation for why no supremacy appeared after\nHe arrived but I ... it was a strange possible men controlled women as well as you press them [noise] because they're good\nAnd so it's about power really\nWrite that scholars say after patriarchy developed with the first societies to settle down and farm\nThose cultures became the first colonial powers and they spread systems of patriarchy to the places they colonized\nQuestion though about this room in the idea in our society today I don't really see a lot of reverence for\nReally see a lot of reverence for motherhood or fatherhood for that matter the U.S is practically alone among rich countries and not guaranteeing paid parental leave or help with early childcare we'll pay childcare workers a living wage\nThere are rampant reports of pregnancy discrimination women not getting jobs worth losing them because they got pregnant\nAnd really even in terms of attitudes\nDo you really think the typical man in our society is an author of women's ability to give birth\nOr do you most guys kind of see it as mundane no big deal something you're quite happy to leave to women\nNo I I I take your point I I don't think our society socialize is a truly hold motherhood in high esteem\nExcept on Mother's Day gift that but but there is evidence that uh if we're talking about how we got this thing you know maybe the original motives for patriarchy there is evidence that that was different and at least some\nHunter gatherer societies\nMel ... told me about cultures in which the husbands of pregnant women eat plants that make them constipated so when the woman goes into labor the the dad goes out into the Bush and struggles strange to push out heroic poop\nAnd then he comes back and reports that he gave birth to a stillborn baby wow so it seems like some kind of indication that those guys want in the drama and the glory of of childbirth\nMaybe the equivalent in our culture is that you know is the high class guy who pointed as partners pregnant belly and says look what I did\nAnd you know I Want to pick up on something else um make conch he talked about controlling women's bodies and that is really\nA huge part of what males the premise is about for me men want access to women's bodies they want to control women's sexuality and our production of babies power and control isn't that another piece of the puzzle at least as important as women the\nWell here's how Mel ... he says a lot of what has happened in human history over the last ten thousand years is about men's desire to control uterus says let me bring in one more expert here Lisa weighed she's a sociologist at occidental college in California\nSo for example controlling linens sexual behavior and wasn't there wasn't a lot of reason to do that when men weren't really interested in being able to pass down their stuff to their own biological child\nIf they didn't own a bunch of stuff there was no real passing down to do and from what we know\nA hunter gatherers even if they understood the biology every production they didn't really prioritize biological father had so much as I understand that we are a big kin group and everyone is just helping each other raise all of these children which are ours right\nBut when people started accumulating stuff land and other property and men were building these patriarchal conspiracies as Malecon or put it men decided it was important to know they'd be passing their property down to their biological children OK well their sons\nAnd men started to think of women as property to property they could trade by way of marriage for land or some other financial alliance with another patriarch property that could be damaged as an act of war property that had no more legal rights than a chair or a table\n[noise] and most cultures across the world that state of affairs has lasted for thousands of gender hierarchy with men firmly in charge and women having few if any of\nThe women have pushed back with real but limited success in the last century or two [noise]\nAfter the break we jumped ahead to about three hundred years ago in Europe and North America when things really could have changed have should have changed but they didn't so they deny her [noise] and I see this as a door slamming shut for winning [noise]\nThis program has drawn from a season long series on our podcast scene on radio series is

dot com\nIs gender and science section as colonial science a\nProfessor ... of Stanford University is showing our producer her library her home in the bay area eventually she gets to a frame to document on all\nThis is the page from ... diary this is the comment that she discovered the photocopy page represents shaping our own important discovery early in her career as an historian\nShe found a page in Paris in the astronomical notebooks of a German couple we often think of women coming into science as the twentieth century phenomenon but really women were scientists and very good scientists in the seventeenth Eighteenth century as well\nBut eventually after two years the academy decides that is a woman was there is drawing them or people would laugh you know this is actually\nWhat they say they were a young academy at the time the Paris was where the scientific action was not in Berlin they were looking for status and prestige and they were worried that a woman would destroy that data is impressive ... so they deny her Mm\nAnd I see this as a door slamming shot for women is Maria ... had been the astronomer at the academy in Seventeen ten it may have been that women would have followed that this would have opened the door to the regular participation of women in astronomy\n\n\nA salon she says in her research she found it in the early Seventeen hundred about ten percent of astronomers in Germany were women almost three hundred years later when she was writing your book and the percentage was lower\nThat is incredible and looking back we might think it was inevitable of course Murray of income on didn't get that job of course male dominance would prevail for several more centuries it seems like a given because we know the end of that story right but she seems to be saying he could have gone the other way\nYeah what happened to Maria van column on just looks like a power play by the man in charge of the Berlin academy right she deserves the job she was already in the job and in fact a few years after rejecting her for the position\nThey gave it to her son was Maria as her son's quote unquote assistant justice she'd been her husband's assistance\nSo the academy retain her services anyway as one of their inhouse astronomers they just\nWeren't going to give the title to a woman just because that just was not done right but that kind of blatant exclusion was potentially going to get more problematic as you moved further into the Seventeen hundreds and enlightenment ideas really took hold\nRight for many centuries it had been enough to say that women are subordinate to man based on the theory of humorous or on interpretations of the Bible but by the Seventeen hundreds those notions just weren't holding up anymore and societies newly interested in actual evidence\nAnd not only that this was the enlightenment and people were embracing the idea that all people were born with God given in alien ... writes in an Englishman John Locke formulation in the sixteen hundreds we all have a natural right to life liberty and property\nThese ideas we're creating new complications for the racist and sexist societies on both sides of the Atlantic says along the shaving her\nNow if you wanted to not give rights to women or two African slaves or to others in the society you had to\nExplain from nature why they are not equal so mad at me so this study of the female and the male body take center stage\n[noise] okay so John tell us more and then we'll talk on the other side are at the assume\nMother she says what plays out in the mid seventies hundreds is what she calls a war over skeletons scientific illustrators were making a first detailed drawing a female skeleton and even though this was supposed to be pure science\nThe drawings were politically loaded the two that became the most influential\nWere drawn by a German man Samuel ... during the French woman Genevieve dark and veal and a story isn't going to go the way you might expect\nShe says both drawings had problems but the one by the French woman was the more sexes to the to the German\nNan portrays the female stole as large the French woman portrays the female skull as smaller and she portrays the powerless\nAs very very large and roomy very large in proportion to the rest of the body\nAnd it was just go in the pelvis that became the sights of political debate\nTo make this clear madam dark and veal didn't just happen to choose a model skeleton with a smallish head and abroad pelvis her drawing was out of proportion with any normal woman\nWomen ... are slightly larger than men in proportion to the rest of the body but in her drawing dark and veal made the woman's head a naturally small at her pelvis very big even though women's pelvis is or no broader than men's\nCheating or says Thomas ... drawing was more accurate but Genevieve darken feels became more popular image of the female anatomy the one most adopted by doctors and medical schools maybe because it's squared with an emerging narrative about gender differences\nThe new anatomy is a scientific foundation to the exclusion of women and on top of that is layered a lot of ideology\nAnd instead of if you take liberal philosophy that men and women should be equal\nThere was developed this theory of complement charity and that's the idea that men and women complement each other they aren't the equals of each other but they are the natural complement and this again shows that men should belong to the public sphere\nOf science and the professions and the state and women should belong to the private\nSphere of the home and children of the loving and nurturing\nAppealed to anatomy helped the patriarchal thinkers\nWhen their argument over the egalitarian that argument was real even though in a male dominated inside the battle took place mostly among men nears the Johns Hopkins historian Toby deep again there is constant ...\nConstant push and constant conflict and even though what you're seeing is a certain kind of stability and continuity it takes enormous labor to keep reproducing that and they're always they're always moments when things went differently could have gone\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables

heard from the top of the episode and other leading enlightenment thinkers like ... phone call or say lock in life and it's all argued with varying degrees of passion\nFor the equality of the sexes yes yes men are often wonderful feminist\nOn the other side where men like Emmanuel conned Francis Bacon and maybe the most\nPivotal thinker on the woman question John Jacques Russo writing in the seventeenth sixties Russo appeal to the supposed anatomical differences between men and women women's smaller brains and bigger pelvis has to back his theory of compliment territory\nWomen are less inherently valuable and man that would have gone against Rousseff those liberal ideals instead he said women were just fundamentally different but different and waste it proved nature designed women to serve men\nThe woman's entire education should be plan in relation to men policemen to be useful to them to ... and respect to raise them as children careful them as adults\nJeez are women's duties in all the Jews and ... should be taught from childhood\nSo Toby Dietz says complimentary already become the new justification for excluding women from lots of things but especially from the halls of political and economic power\nAnd you begin to say well she's not as rational maybe say that you draw on that stream\nOf discouraged she's rational but not as rational she is disqualified on the basis
