new\nYorker radio our production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick if you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women had been treated for so long\nThe way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter\nIf you look at the way flake change disposition afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subject of Rebecca Traister his new book\nGood in mad the revolutionary power of women's anger the book and binds a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister is written for New York magazine el the New York times and the Washington Post and her last book was called old single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation Rebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testify about her sexual assault allegations\nRebecca there's no way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the\nSenate Judiciary committee has done its questioning ... there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as as mere is and and others in a very particular ... what did the specifics tally\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view of cultures around wealth\nWhite fundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite\nUm friday\nHard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free um social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on pads toward immense power\nAnd the narrative as it was when I was young and irresponsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with it and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement\nIt's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't hasn't behave that way it's like in discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good mad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf\nSponsorship of the cage you read the live stream by deference master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate courses including history literature banned political science and infection will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch that for ...\n[laughter] um this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good um what's that you often [noise] um\nIt was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh gosh\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women\nI was acutely aware of my identity um as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been lingered by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think\nMore clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women\nAnd one of them had said about the white young white men who was like the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because if your guys as white men who are not voting for her\nWhere the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument which is like leave him be it is not worth the\nInvestment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women do not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em right right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great\nBut I felt some that that phrase go get your boys\nWith egg laying in my own head and I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also thinking about white women and what impulses and messages are at work on white women and um\nI felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so crowded and it was on a walk with my husband\nUm between Christmas and New Years of that year assist twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dry is I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is and I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger\nAnd as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what but suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplars of constructive anger in the book historically are black women mhm I'm Shirley Chisholm\nFlorence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats or Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till that's not by any coincidence that's not have the smart by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in forum to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean a poly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Maria was credited by both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately\nWind up I'm protecting and uh trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader um\nAnd Florence Kennedy I haven't heard the name for the Kennedy in years I mean she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she ... she and she and Gloria Steinem worth speaking partners caught on the road you can ride ... tell us a little bit about four it's kind of\nSo Florence Kennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous\nFor her time but I think she would be outrageous now highly shot in her demeanor and her willingness to be vocally profane\nLily unapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism and she wasn't going to play nice at all\nKnow you wrote a book about a time when you're you're working in a male dominated office uh-huh\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or someone who show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there Dr King said what
