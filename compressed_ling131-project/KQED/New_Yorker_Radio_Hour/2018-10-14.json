first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems and altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome with an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help has been writing for the New Yorker about election security in what she's found should scare us all\nLogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia\nI'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time\nIn August twenty six team at the height of the presidential election he started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems which ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that\nI did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election stuck in a salt dot edu a Google please give me all of the PDF documents on his website and generally that turns up reports or public presentation\nAnd the this particular searched didn't turn that up instead I found it\nVery curious links and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or name in some sort of agenda fire next to their name and I immediately thought wow that that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and lay found in all of that data dishonest him\nThese documents contain supervisor password to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought in my wildest this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded states teeny gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of that land also found security hole to which you can download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters I had access\nTo their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms databases and a gym databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIs Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza that the scariest\nScenario I can think of would be\nAn attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise the Web server and use it at the beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream buy at the gym

com\nSystem to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally\nPatched then more information started\nTo trickle out [noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked\nAbout Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen\nAnd later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise] look we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems\nIn twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know\nBut this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms a few months ago the director of national intelligence said the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines\nGeorgia is one of five states that entirely has machine that don't have a paper ballot then there's also other machines which count paper about those are also computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop our regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here at the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing a programming gets infected with malicious offered it can be transferred to the individual voting machine\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep bunks that assertion which is that many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless mode and to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night\nAnd those wireless modems go over\nCellular networks and those selling their networks\nAre part of the Internet we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies\nBut there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge\nVoters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names warrant on the voter rolls are they in turn county they use electronic poll books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you're at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nFor the electronic pull books was underneath the our system now the our system\nHad been targeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack and um the state board of elections did their own investigation or as did the county to county\nReport and has been made public it wasn't very adaptive didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker our malfunctions\nI'm miss the animals and I miss you ever won another\nAnother way\n\nI Need to know the play\n\nWill live tease me and he knows where\n\nThis one

I'm In through all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can again I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um if leaves you relieve me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life\nIt's you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying no problem no perjury yeah not a problem I'm sure that that is a new normal\nAnd how has it changed the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as yeah proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to it a law oftentimes as hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety [laughter] I'm anxious about the state of the world which is terrible\nAnd so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial of the great advice yeah and um don't expect much keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary forget which one it was\nBecause the scene appears in so many documentaries abuse singing at\nThe march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you visualize\nIn your mind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen was a half million people or whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and\nYou know I think as I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote\nHistoric moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah you\nYou mean there's some there's some times that you were in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea\nI think festival a political moment\nYeah I'm just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like ants you know that's just jobs if people\nAnd so I had a hint then of the distance going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever and in yours and mine yeah you you know\nThis next song that you're going to do I went to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these\nThese ... relatives of people who lost people in the church there in this in this slaughter\nAnd it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a when too it seems like a million years ago it was the idea of a\nOf a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only is the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies\nBut he's able to sing the song I Begin the song yeah that lifts people off as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering this song it was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them in the future of this song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way most\n... I did not know and most people didn't know um [noise] I Need to tune into doing against architect firm I mean if I was quicker and tune\nYou can only be knocking that guitar and you're killing on knocking\nEar hearing loudly\nAnd they just go ahead yeah okay Mm\nMm Mm\nMm\nMm Mm Mm\nYoung men came to our house and they didn't know anyone brought him [noise] he\nWas not friends he was not keen by the ...\nAnd they let him Maine\nAnd foreign our the strangers me didn't he sat with them many seemed to me\nBut then a young man to learn and nine in the room loaded on yeah\n\nNo word on ya\n[noise] [noise] Mm Mm Mm Mm and\nIn Charlotte and in the month of June ... mourners gathered in\nThe president came to speak some and the cameras roll and the nation and her\nMom would\nSay what must be in a bar all their living and\nSo on that day and then that\nThe president saying\nOh amazing grace cheese the president's hang on many Mm\nMm Mm\nMm Mm\nWe argue whether native name 'em one man hanging around nation shame some sickness the mind and I know and how we\nMight be made whoa you\nKnow no one could say what much these and all the living and\nSo on that day that the president has sang amazing\nGrace in my head and\nSang a man thing for me\n\n[noise] wow yeah the last line is my president which is this just switch yeah for that presidents like president he says is the only president you felt of this and that way but\nOr with your satellite phone which will allow him to stay in contact with AOL Lee Antarctic logistics an expedition a company that helped get polar explorers on and off the confidence\nOkay start gay checked\nEach night after a long track your call Eli give them his medical condition and his court in it if he was ever in trouble he could call for what he referred to as the most expensive taxi ride in the world which will be a rescue plan to pull him out\nAs well as you are on drugs\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of his day which could then be posted on his website and it updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\nBring everybody showing today well where have all the way to close calls it\nA shot to light the glacier closest others [noise]\nHe was incredibly good linking\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine [noise]\nMost of my friends friends\nThey are wild and\nWe'll also that someone in special forces was very very glamorous [noise]\nI'm actually I could trust paper\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nHe had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or s a F a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites uh she\nHates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world than Antarctica\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nHe really was a tree remind take Hitler loved tray hidden love don't he he did tapestry\nHe stitched the most wonderful ...\nCase ... skating across the snow\nHeating of the history of all these old explorers and he glamour eyes that lives with his head\nWe're in faith that there was\nNo in fact [noise]\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways a was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self he set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it better\nFor the men for my money\nAnd so I made a decision that always stylish or hadn't even worse they\nHe decided to turn\nThem that we of it\nAnd on the other ... most famous expedition that Shackleton\nHad wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great price to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship the difference that frozen in the ice\nAnd Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest either with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was she was able to guide all the men in his immediate party\nAnd get them back all home alive\nI can say yeah I Know that they have the loyal to the very far ...
