post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy and I started to learn more and I started to grow and\nPost high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy\nAnd I started to learn more and I started to grow and when I realized that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an axis potential that was there\nAnd that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell fresher stories and we are heroes at that time Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah arguing Judy Garland

across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that um I feel like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life but Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who\nDid an album and made a career fully being herself she did not shy away from\nHer religious belief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not have a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a singer

shouldn't be so dense they should be more simple and acceptable and\nBut the temptation to fold must have been something financially and in terms of fame and all the things the rewards for the record

often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year\nIn the euro Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter loss of Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing is for most on people's minds\nIs a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards and they're really unhappy about it\nOne of the community is a lot of visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAfrican is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we saw Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump than twenty six teams in the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton actually and it's heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters far Republicans and yell for al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance to go Rob\nWere on a leafy suburb and straight their colonial houses which are made of Bracken sided with final

office Danielle excuses orange now\nYou do okay well I actually live right on top and\nDrive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the

establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within five fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten

like you have to admit if we can stick 'em\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there are only thirty homes within a mile in that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless straight um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality\n[noise] so you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics it's just\nAn example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of the regulatory roll back and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occurred to me it just something I ever like\nMaybe I thought it would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but\nAfter all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just a lack of humanity from are the

words like you have to do with the underlying facts in order to correct a constructive argument I'm\nNot really a science more of them are just kind of a camp to other things you may there are kind of common sense will judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make common such judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we shouldn't show you how to do it

year\nYeah just like lava China yeah well ... yeah well we want to be telling you\nIt was sort of shoot it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach is that I think the problem with that is just absolutely if he says no it doesn't have a vendor speak for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's a it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like in California and speeches fed
