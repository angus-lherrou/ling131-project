for A M early Sunday Morning it's all about choking under pressure it happens to just about everybody whether you're going for Olympic gold or giving a wedding tell us\nTo talk with a psychologist economists and the Gulf or who some say committed the greatest choke of all time freakonomics radio at four AM\nLenient famine ... north highland Sacramento at midnight [noise]\n\nLooking at it\nFrom one World Trade center in Manhattan is if the New Yorker radio our protectionist ... studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nThe big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable\nFor the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... or work in Texas in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York but another story in this election is the very opposite\nThe candidates were running as extreme is on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew Moran who's been covering the movement known as the alt right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nInjury you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like my concern is itch for example who was involved in pizza the gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbs Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist I've been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start one of the origins of it\nIt's never really not exist but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely note that Democrats have been gauging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was first campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because\nHe was the first thing tonight it when people ask him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he the separately denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that the alliance should exist\nSo what is what is Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve ... is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability\nAnd then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics are our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's baby there's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there's no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not real\nOf it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kind of gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat too doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walked back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you started that's the way the differences then you end up with people that are at each other's throats and adding up Hispanic and black and ... it predicts will be a greater number there whites that America I offered this panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that or I mean there are there are much more extreme example of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables have saying by talking about ah you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is there for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forgot how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably wash their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is there a guy there not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nSo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan field they cannot afford to reject somebody like ...\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou've spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber predator fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and what does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't we weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that\nYou know yeah ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here\nI think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety where the extremely a dicey racial history\nThat I'm perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy there's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy\nWell let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. shoulder to shoulder and had the chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like he's\nMuch taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king he still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms\nWhat's the district knock it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at a Twitter feed but racism is not his only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seem to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like horse Stewart he was someone who the Virginia GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support he's doing better than one would expect I mean he\nHe won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments\nWe can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so [laughter] not the heart of the country are not part of the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means\nTo you in New Jersey in the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross and was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap that an outlier incidents that have very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of the extremists voice in\nYeah I think he I think the ... thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more anomalous cases then that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nIt's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy Seth Grossman is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that you know this is happening everywhere all the time\nThat General Flynn was providing false information sensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only once he knew that the Russians knew that too\nAnd because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it's it's a black male so what did you like what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel 'em and told him that I needed to come see him right away\nTold him what we have learned that\nYou know the vice president have been on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so\nYou got the the pie out there saying this step so we told 'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd when you go see him a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back and ... was that different are the same or what it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official lies to another\nAnd what did you make of that [noise]\nUm well I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which\nGod that would help people would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides\nMore combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official lies to another and what did you make of that um\nWell I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official line to another which\nGod that would help people would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public that that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo you're stuck in meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seven also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issued yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\n[noise] so how did you find out about the travel there um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd I get a call I was able to keep one a with name on a system my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so\nCalls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times and it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend\nI'm trying to get our arms around and communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and by Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and spent a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges were\nWhat the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges by the constitutional statutory late and otherwise that have been filed um\nAnd at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was it became clear that to defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job of the department of justice to defend\nActions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or ... you're the president's ... the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy Graham perhaps the appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that um but not directed apart but not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe ... should go into court and make an argument that's not grounded in truth\nBut the department of justice [noise]\nI mean [noise] if the OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked a defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted interests um but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside\nAnd that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I wasn't like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general with the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions\nWho they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that with a mall for wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that\nYou know none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will you saying no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication\nThat we have a we had there were communications going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the directive to the department and\nSponsorship of the kick you read the live stream by super micro Silicon Valley big manufacturer of energy

weren't going to allow the\nTravel ban to defend it look I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for me I Would say probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped\nThat maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back and take a breath and look at what they were doing and more ...\nOkay I Know everybody got\nSo loud [laughter] you know it seems kind of silly now doesn't it um\nBut you know I did harbored as hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of get in touch 'em there would be real discussion about this um I had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place\nUm I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um\nI suppose you could say that the president and made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was unlawful and unconstitutional I think it's\nAbsolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country and\n[noise]\nSally is a long time John

kept\nThat membership for affairs for the survey every\nFemale vocal period I was just on a mission to just scan the world for every single type of thing and yeah and so I just would learn music and other languages but mainly jazz you know that was the thing that I was sort of serving the most and\nUm so you know I've had different periods where I was just immersed in one sound um and then after that it was sort of a really experimental music you know we're so electronic and experimental music\nWhen I think about my experimental electronic music side a lot of those references are still black
