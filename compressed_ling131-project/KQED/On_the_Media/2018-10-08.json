Ford\nI've never seen so many were ... memory safest and my wife especially against one\nYeah the question is if there's something going on what's known as a conspiracy\nYeah when more emerged a lot

communication for his ... and by extension the victimization of that today as the it themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation unloading powerfully that tends to us just scan as an index that identity\nIn front of the nation we saw his righteous indignation he choked back his tears and aimed his fury not a doctor for but rather of this unfair confirmation process which frankly is an embarrassed\nAnd I saw in the aftermath of the hearing a surprising number is pundits describing both his testimony interests as equally credible which I found establishing but once again we tend to find anger especially when it comes from a man to be somehow corroborating it's one of the things that we are\nIt was a pretty vanilla vision he basically said we have to get along with white people you have to work hard you can cheat or steal or drink\nIf we do all these things but then we will be reunited with our loved ones and our ancestors in the after world give us almost Protestant and it's his insistence on a kind of work ethic as it's spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought as they did the dancers and the right way and for the red shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen in the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or or some kind of catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meaning the white\nPeople and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted expand sue as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place\nBut almost immediately the government open fire with ... on largely an armed men women and children\n[noise] the descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a semblance of an Indian\nAnd then you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer she said having wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization\nFollow it up with one more wrong and white fees on pained and untenable creatures from the face of the year\nVirtue of being wrong to run our threat almost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceedings four hundred years of interactions between calling us and indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything\nThis was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the mosque car they learn from Barry in my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this ...\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic Bernie my heart when Disney is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever publishing Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety I start\nAt the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre when Geneva where the culture and civilization if the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty in the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you will understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised an held up on one hand and then silenced in done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different fact not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep around despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assault and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live\nFully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if this is a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared\nAt Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and evidence of his land nearby off the following treating real purchase a health Rhode Island for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of do from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nThis is we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with the items right [noise] they all had rifles and shotguns and they search\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kinds of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means\nWho was a Lakota activists who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon [laughter]\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present to the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been the dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that he was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timber and mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank Carlo chi one of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice that is right in Seventy three\nWas that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice that's right\nIn Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see and hear [noise]\nTimes come when [noise] violence might happen to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile\nMurders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around the Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd sell for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded me was under siege\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou say you had very complicated feelings about it\nI too am activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people the troubled government of Pine Ridge was very against this stick Wilson the German the Pine Ridge was interested in mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military build up everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom were not native hostage\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it\nWas frogs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustled in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell\nDavid thank you so much thank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show\nDavid trier isn't a chip away from the leech lake reservation in Minnesota he's a professor of literature the University of Southern California a novelist and author of the forthcoming book the height\nOf wounded knee native America from eight to nine oppressive [noise]\nA game of Germans in Indian is on the media\nOn the media is supported by target present and future in which\nA pod cast on change makers and the projects they're checking and communities nationwide\nFuture in orange and babble on apple pie cats or wherever pond caster found\nNo oh\n\nNo no\nNo oh\n\nMm\nMm\n\n[noise] this is on the media and Brooke Gladstone indigenous people stay on Monday we'll pay homage to\nHis ancestors and homeland were trampled with colonial gets regard the question of who should claims solidarity with their minorities seems straightforward enough but perhaps not because of Germany's racist far right party alternative for Germany\nClaims kinship with the plight of Native Americans German historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across the imagery in an alternative for Germany moon biking to pass and fortunately\nI found it hilarious at first\nIt was in a tweet by one of the local branches of it's an ... the alternative for Germany\nThe tweet showed the photograph of they didn't believe it said the Indian couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us year in Germany if we are not careful and it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six it was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation and election campaigns of many European right wing party in Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front room there's\nEven a term for this phenomenon Indian food the housing and you say that India and the thing is the ads and and German nationalism actually shares similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds that Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either\nUnder military occupation or had been forced to become allies off Napoleon so nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation miss\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that cancer to wonder if the very few sources describe these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as it could end and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones or who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament what's akin to that as the noble Savage\nExactly entered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off a blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the late Nineteen century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this solved\nNineteenth century that was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters that German immigrant and adventure old cheddar hand and his Apache friend written into the farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls [laughter]\nWay after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shatter hand on himself so named because he could not this fall is out with one explosive hunch exactly Apache teeth and then to see to me the really popular among the German public right\nYes he is an ... an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter] she's always out there by himself looking for white people you can help\nAnd Carl my made him exotic enough to fit into the frame of the adventure but as some scholars described itchy and it also seems to be a very good German [laughter]\nBecause he has his character trait that their German bourgeoisie or supposed to strive towards like on the bravery industrious nests\nThese novels had a very long life was Hitler\nYet it is that that late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler allocated enough paper to distribute a hundred thousand vena two novels to the troops\nBecause he said reading about Venus you will help German officers you with your ... warfare on the Eastern Front that venue to what the ideal company commander bunny Watson why\nThere were those people who said German children should only be confronted with area and heroes\nHowever Hitler was a fan and also pragmatist said it would cost too much effort to try to suppress German Indian Suzie as them why not harness and profit from it\nPeople like you know how we take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym ... said presenting India novels to German children teaches them about leadership and military training and racial ideology\nHow to teach about race ideology\n[noise] yeah they take wrote
