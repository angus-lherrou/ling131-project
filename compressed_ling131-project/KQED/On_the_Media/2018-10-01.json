discuss the qualifications of any nominee until after the first actual action\nObviously in this case the clock is set to hit zero on November six when the Democrats have a reasonable shot at taking over the Senate and making it even tougher for a Trump nominee to the high court\nIndeed the Republican hold on the Congress is so slight the president seems to be laying the groundwork for accusations of illegitimacy if the Democrats take a house or to by suggesting on Wednesday that China plans to buy that\nThey do not want me or us to win because I Am the first president ever to challenge China on trade\nBut we don't need China or Russia to throw sand in the gas tank of democracy because we're doing that ourselves systematically and increasingly for more than a century and we've been doing it by keeping people from voting\nThis past summer the Brennan Center for justice released a new report on voter purges it documented sixteen million voters removed from the rolls between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen almost four million more than were removed between two thousand and six and two thousand and eight\nAnd the areas with the most dramatic calling exactly the regions that until twenty Thirteen were so historically unfair to eligible black voters that the voting rights act subjected them to pre clearance from the Justice Department\nPre cleared means that any changes that that state or that county we're going to make in their voting laws had to be okayed by the U.S department of justice or the federal court before that change was made\nCarol Anderson is a professor of history at Emory University and author of one person no vote a voter suppression is destroying our democracy she says that the previous law the Nineteen fifty seven civil rights act had been insufficient to deal with the disenfranchisement of black voters in the south\nBy the time that the u._s. was fighting the Nazis only three percent of African American adults were registered to vote in the south\nThe state's implemented new laws new purchases and the civil rights act couldn't deal with it the voting rights act could because of pre clearance because these states could not implement a law than running elections based on this franchise meant\nHave politicians who had been elected because of just franchise men who are crafting nudist franchising laws the voting rights act really short circuit at that\nThese jurisdictions have been caught red handed and were required to pass federal muster before enforcing any of these rules intended to suppress the vote which they claimed was an onerous burden and by the twenty first century no longer necessary\nBecause they've cleaned up their act and in Shelby County versus holder the Supreme Court agreed to some\nThe county commissioners and\nShelby County Alabama and be gone and next thing vast parcels of land around Calera city\nAll of this without getting pre cleared by the department of justice so they're violating federal law there had been one lone black city councilman in ... city\nThe lone black councilman moved from a district where she was going to get elected to a district where over Seventy percent of the residents had voted against the rock Obama\nIn the next election after all of this redistricting glare city no longer even had one black councilman\nAnd the Justice Department sued Shelby County saying it was in violation of the pre clearance requirements in the voting rights act\nAnd the U.S Supreme Court with chief justice John Roberts writing an opinion of four or five four decision\nSaid that one\nRacism was no longer the kind of prevalent force that it had been that gave rise to the need for the voting rights act he pointed to black elected officials Hispanic elected officials\nThe increase in black voter turnout and he said so it's clear that racism is just not operating in the United states at least not at that kind of high level\nAnd he said that the voting rights act didn't take into account the changing dynamics of America\nLet's just say that the Roberts five four majority was the case of premature re calculation about the level of racism in the electoral process\nComes now the burning numbers which shows that the voter purges suppressing the black vote is highest in precisely the places where the court decision let the statistic turns off the hook in other words they went right back to their former practices\nYou hit it head on we had every indication of this we had Alabama in two thousand nine eleven that past of voter id law now when Alabama was ...\nPast of voter id law now when Alabama was working on this law the Republicans record it themselves talking and they said we need to figure out how to de Presse the black voter turnout\nAnd then all of the racism course out you're going to have all of these aborigines and these illiterates getting on these high finance buses ain't going to the polls\nAnd so they crafted a voter ID laws targeted at African Americans to depress the vote but that was in two thousand eleven before Shelby County beholder\nImmediately after Shelby County beholder boom Alabama begins to implement that law the same with Texas and so these states we're just poised\nThey had these laws drafted ready to go and the purging was a key piece of it here in Georgia our secretary of state Brian Kemp who's now running for governor has a program called exact match\nWhat exact match does is it says that your voter registration card\nHas to exactly match what in the bureau of motor vehicles database say you have a driver's license or or from the Social Security office\nNow where that gets dicey is said that your name is hyphenated\nUm Garcia hyphen marches and you hyphenated\nWhen you write it for your voter registration card but stay on your driver's license in the driver's license database there's not a hyphen\nThey're not having a high and\nGets you kicked out of your voter registration and your voter registration is denied\nNo it's not just purchase of the voter rolls and there's many other classic tools of voter suppression I just want to make the point that this is not some sort of new development it\nHas a long sinister sordid history in Eighteen Ninety during the rise of Jim Crow the state of Mississippi was trying to figure out how do we stop black people from voting\nAnd they devised what was called the Mississippi plant such as the poll tax where you have to pay\nIn order to vote such as the literacy tests where you had to read sections of the constitution needs of the state constitution or the U.S constitution and interpret it to the liking of the registrar such as the white primary where only whites could vote in the Democratic primary\nThe grandfather clause the good character clause that wasn't a ray of devices that created a package of disenfranchisement targeted at the black population\nThey couldn't just say we don't want black people to vote because there was this thing called the fifteenth amendment to the constitution that said that the right to vote shall not be abridged on account of race color or previous servitude\nAnd so they were trying to figure out then how do we eliminate most of the black voters if not call and still remain constitutional\nThat framing led to going after ... Syed Ali impose characteristics on people\nAnd then making that the litmus test for access to the ballot box so poverty coming out of slavery African Americans were impoverished there was no forty acres as no meal that kind of poverty than played into the poll tax the significant massive under funding a black schools\nOn the other side the IRS has really chosen\nTo protect that John or an identity is rather than to disclose the identity them this is the way they aren't they moving recently because they believe that there's too much room for error that there had been leaks I've done who did not want to be disclosed the\nIRS hadn't moved away from disclosure so it's really unlikely that keeps coming agent you hear that you anything on time she and make a huge difference for the midterm Stanley or even in time to make a real difference next year\nAnd let's say in some fantasy world both the federal election commission and the IRS do pass some explicit rules governing five oh one C. fours and\nA similar category fiber once the sixes if we've know anything from history it's that\nPolitical money adapts if you're a political high roller and rules change you know you're going to find a new way to donate if you run the show yeah he leave political action committee what would be your next move\n... social welfare now that I as a non profit at St George on our could you give me some money to al ... and then I Will use your money\nIn whatever way it take to get there said he cursing out changing the way that they're asking on extra money they might be asking you generally support what I should point out just please give us money and then maybe they'll try to\nSupport what I support as a group please give us money and then maybe they'll try to use the money for political purposes it's really unclear that's allowed but that's one creative way that the groups might start doing it\nAnother way that the ... and they start operating is that they might give it to an affiliate is different so I as a Michelle geek you eat non profit group took a donation and then I make a donation to a superPAC and that that way to get her pack\nThat's close to the nonprofit that gave the money and the show you that you're a non profit and would not have to disclose any donors who gave them money to the nonprofit so it's actually adding one more layer between the identity of the donor and whatever would trigger that the school year of that person's identity\nAlso known as money laundering\nThat that's what some critics might call it I wouldn't I regret objective reporter call it that\nIf there is a change in the uh the political donor ecosystem at what point do you think the status quo will change by the twenty twenty presidential election for example\nAlthough it's not officially in effect and we may not see any sort of official change in behavior for the next term it's already started all trained to have your ... and the tax and non profit\nGroups that are broken and let the owners are so I'm like how they know where all the possible change coming down the pike and when the lower court ruling came down\nIn early August and actually put a lot of these groups on alert so they had then scrambling to figure out what they're\nAccount for what this means for their funding for twenty eight children what they should be telling a John or how they change the script for asking for donations and donors are already asking well what does this mean for me how early could my identity the this goes to the public that's actually\nChanged a lot of behaviors already\nLet me ask you one less thing however this plays out it still seems to me like a surprising decision by a Roberts' court Citizens United courts\nTo let stand this lower court decision that complicated life for political donors can we do find anything about this situation beyond its particulars\nThere's very little could read and chip away at the Supreme Court reacted here because we don't know why that happened we don't know why they're that's because the other justices deadlocked for four on this or whether they just wanted to go to the full appeals process\nWe just have no idea what it and you say about that certainly in the context that judge Kavanaugh's nomination it's that after this case ... therapy or it could come back before the Supreme Court and\nIs buried or justice Kavanaugh who\nIs not a fan of his career or campaign finance regulation it could really make a huge impact in the ... campaign finance regulation or the side and on the Supreme Court level so that has really interesting at the patients that are just\nLooking forward [noise] Michelle thank you so much I think is on the show yeah he is a national reporter

democratic system\nThis week in the New Republic Rebecca ... recalls a ... story she heard a long time ago I found the right who demands that his age explain heaven and hell to him\nThe stage replies by asking why he should explain anything to an idiot like the samurai\nThe ladder becomes so enraged in response to that he draws his sword and prepares to kill\nThe sage says as the blade approaches\nHeld the samurai pauses and realization begins to slide in the same age says\nWould get there from here to short circuit the wiring that\nLeads to in bracing bad information that supports our views and the ... like the dismissal of the character and motives have does not within our own tried mom right author of why\nBuddhism is true the science and philosophy of meditation and enlightened meant told us last year that before we can get our minds moving in a healthy your direction\nHave to know where the beam\nBrains were designed financial what you do one thing ... genes into the next generation any particular environment in something more like a hunter gatherer environment and that's where she crazy things like road rage don't seem to make any sense to me rage made a little more sense in a different environment blame\nWell in a hunter gatherer environment rage gets you to demonstrate\nThat you cannot be taken advantage of somebody tries to ... to ... to meet whatever you show you're willing to fight you get mad enough to fight even if you lose the fight you demonstrated that there's a cost okay\nWhat do you take this out on the highway well first of all nobody's watching is are you ever going to see you again on demonstrating anything to them plus now you're going eighty miles an hour\nAnd the consequences could be worse and you know seem a lot of things in his id yoga lot of things kind of miss fire in a modern environment\nGives me an example of how guilty missed fires\nYou might fuel you did something to somebody\nYou wonder did I thin and you feel guilty\nBut they're not like living right next door to you won't see them around the campfire that night and and that kind of thinking fester for a long time and just go unresolved not quite ... emailing them about and you're less they're wondering\nThat just didn't happen in the natural environment everyone you're interacting with new interacted with pretty much all the time so\nActing with pretty much all the time\nSo what you've got is a an accumulation of [noise] like a haystack full of little twigs that you carry around in like a weight that are meaningless and that don't matter\nYeah well one of them take comes or Buddhism is that you should not assume that your feelings have the meaning they seemed to have\nYou know when they tell you this person is a bad person or you should be upset about this\nDon't assume that they're giving you guidance and mindfulness meditation is too large in a way of looking at your feelings for more objective standpoint it doesn't mean you don't have feelings you experienced them but you exert more conscious control over which feelings you let carry you away and carry your train of thought away", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the
