she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms that she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bottom fights\nA political miscalculation but also a stumble into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess than their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim ... is a professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer Z\nI don't mean to sound cliche but everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not governed so strongly by the idea of having distant unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage chance fate\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors the dog and a lot ... at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land her hands of household and of course only men and settler ideas of family not the time to be has a ... volt\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you have to have a register of Indian swelled tribesmen first nations and other indigenous community didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their can these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment to govern and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base real you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and around the whole blood quote unquote\nIs my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance in being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this was the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who's your mom who's your grandma who's your great grandfather who your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base wrong but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote are called to blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that\nBecause her father is non native now if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate that every year we've got you know debates in conversations on our reservation should we go\nConversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to one day\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards winning all the fat rules to try to make our roads more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with a U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women and this is something ... she got some set in the New Yorker you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ... you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren move I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma and the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nYou know certainly for African Americans even though there's very much a historical and understandable desire to\nBe able to lay claim to identities that are not just about race has cast mhm it's also the case that particularly a place like the United states in twenty eight team that's deeply polarized and becoming deeply racialized no one\nSponsorship of the cake you read the lives dream bike city from Comcast with extending the customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with extended beyond demand\nIn a city or whether

something has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other end identical twins where it apart or identical twins are different in some way\nAnd help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and manage disease [noise]\nYou've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two sets identical male twins who are born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born and somehow didn't amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota and somebody confused a twin one pair for twin and the other I went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade\nBut I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical like histories are amazing the one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary [noise]\nSo what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small a sample I Know but yes but it's a very dramatic
