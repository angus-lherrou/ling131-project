talk about all of that we've got congressional reporter Kelsey Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak every body hair high so it's pretty clear by these\nLimits of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking that she was going to be supporting ...\nAnd then just a few minutes later John mentioned the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cap it on and that brought us to very clearly locked in yes up\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nIt did look that way there was a ... a few moments where we were chasing around Senator Tim and I were standing in different ... different parts of the capital trying to find people like Senator Jeff Flake a Republican of Arizona and counting we mentioned the mansion\nTo see if they were going to stick with their votes\nUm flake was a little bit cryptic we didn't really know what was going to happen and then comments when and had lunch with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and he came out saying that he felt pretty good about things and from there it seems like we were heading in that direction where the fifty window trickling to quickly come into place\nTim friday was a really tense day on Capitol Hill\nIt's been a really tense week on Capitol Hill seems Jeff Flake negotiated this delay this one week\nThe way in which the FBI would we open investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's background there's been a lot of questions about who could eventually get to a yes on ... and I we we found the answer on friday but the fact is that there's been a lot of uncertainty and a lot of\nThese holler or need your help we will never find out\nWhy and if we\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate read all ... with us as well as the ... in Dominican so walk\nUs through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and former representative you've been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's just a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that bill now since the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can be as far as I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at any rate cuts in the beginning the his governor for re election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had her she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane\nBut he's showing me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAn awesome but can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community\nRick Scott you know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate and we should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station he was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care and came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott of being this hardliner on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill Nelson really just wants to have open borders\nDoing a ... one of the big themes of of race or the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends are similar voters throughout the ...\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and infection will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nOn the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the poll or you lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said it'd be energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and with yelling at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nOr a ... and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race

board yes we're here with a\nSpecial broadcast and through the mid term election so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans are suddenly talking about a backlash to all of them the blood\nDrenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man\nWe're finding now that the the the viewer a white male it's okay to be against white guys you're out you're\nDone that's all I didn't get paid for them in and said this poll showed male voters are suddenly\nEnergized 'cause I think it could easily as well turn out to me the era of the man who feel like that targeted on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person was never met said that I did things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do mom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent camera key political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey hey how's it going so ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw president\nTrump act very timid lead toward Christine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nBut certainly she was a very profitable with this well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point up tech enthusiasm among Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men\nYeah what stood out to me in in that poll was in what's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow they were more likely to vote for Republican that for a Democrat just in the past week yeah we have to clean the past week and that is absolutely and everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know they're\nSo much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus following the hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and they there was a big surge in campaign donations\nBut there was something else happening two men were angry\nTam we just heard all of those uh quips with President Trump over the last few days you just did a story on this this isn't a new\nThing from President Trump no not only is it not a new thing for President Trump it's not a new thing in American culture and politics so President Trump really ran on some of this grievance and ...\nReally ran on some of this grievance and and some of this\nFear among people are particularly among white Republican men that the culture has shifted beneath them that you know that\nThey're being left behind that they're being left behind so President Trump and his campaign talked about the forgotten man he talked a lot about political correctness run amok and uh I was talking to Frank Luntz who's a Republican pollster um and he was saying that President Trump tapped into something that had been bubbling up\nYou're welcome [noise]\nVisit politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow\nIt feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed and to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you it's got some of the things we're going to talk about what is in big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh\nSo let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has a tour and he just had a minimum amount versus giving you bigger seats in Congress has not yet giving you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also to band so phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and you know for each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAct and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nA ... a related overdoses I'd just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction of Fenton would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also been linked him to support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment\nAnd abroad and eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs and also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that that can be so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send to investors and diplomats to the United nations so\nThose people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this was about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world\nBut in fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nThat's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics show from NPR Nike Ron accused [noise]\nAnd as I said the

through the mid term election\nAnd every week we dig deep into an issue that galvanizing voter babies\nRip out of their mother literally ripped out of\n\nThis week [noise] immigration they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime there rape is President Trump launched his campaign with a controversial hard line stance on immigration and voters latched onto\nNumber I made that speech and I was badly criticized oh what's so terrible what he's turned out I was a hundred percent right that's why I got elected\n[noise]\nHe carried that immigration talk into his presidency and turned it into policy\nPresident Trump moments ago signed an executive order this will affect the separation of parents from their children at the major backlash tonight against President Trump's travel ban\nThe president's message just fear got Republicans out to vote but it's his policies as president that may turn Democrats out\nReading of this election is border security we have to have to\nDig into all of this my co host ... sat down with NPR's John Burnett and Mara Liasson John covers immigration and it's based in Texas ... one of our national political correspondents\nHarlow T boat Hi there Hi [noise]\nPresident Trump begins his administration with somebody just kind of get pretty mean spirited policy of the travel ban it was one of the first things he did in office and even more recently the summer they would have initiated the family separation this was a huge low point for the Trump Administration\nIn part because they had to roll back a policy that they said was not a policy and many people were incredibly upset even people within his own party\nHe was a summary of where the policy itself stands at this point\nThere are still several hundred kids that are in us custody\nStand at this point yes there are still several hundred kids that are in us custody and these shelters around the country and health and Human Services which is responsible for ... for finding a foster homes for them and sponsors has that it's taking us a long time we have to do all these\nCriminal background check we have to fingerprint every body in the household not just um the family member who wants to take the child back\nBut the larger question is did this achieve its\nGoals the goal was to act as a deterrent I'm really to shock potential immigrants into not coming to the U.S and I had an interview with the chief of staff John Kelly a last may and he said that explicitly to me\nA big name of the game is deterrence if if their family separation stands as a pretty tough ...\nCould be a tough deterrent a would be a tough deterrent um he ah much\nFaster turnaround on asylum you knew people say that's cruel and heartless to take a mother away from her children yeah I think you're cruel and heartless I wouldn't put it quite that way the children will be taken care of\nAnd so obviously the numbers that are referred to earlier about the jump in the family unit and unaccompanied kids crossing the border over the summer the shows that it didn't have a deterrent effect\nSo my sense of how this may at all affect the mid term you know the makeup of Congress because this issue again it's one that I Would argue and an out talking to voters and has somewhat again faded from the conscious\nIf the debate is about border security Republicans win in other words if you're talking about abolishing ice which sounds like dismantling our border security system than Republicans when if you're focusing on separating kids from their parents Democrats win\nBut family separation is over now and over now right and so the of the president's onto the executive order 'em\nAnd so I hear it down in Texas all the way from the attorney general's race to congressional races to the the big Senate race um they use family separation as shorthand\nFor you know look at the atrocities committed by this administration I just don't know how much traction they're getting with that um but it's a it's a wide circulation\nBut these things are like like different ingredients in a big issue I mean they all add up to a feeling that among Democrats and many independents that the Trump Administration has somehow abandoned\nBasic American principles on you know I think that as a specific issue driving voters in the midterms no it's not that but it definitely went into the soup and helped Democrats make this argument that Donald Trump and the Republicans are way out of the mainstream and need a check and balance\nThe early Saturday morning at eleven and again Sunday Morning at ten here National

final vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court that vote is scheduled for Saturdays despite objections some Democrats\nThan FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh was a thorough and is there for not legitimate but stabilizing Ford Palo Alto research psychologist told the Senate Judiciary committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers\nAfter pressure from Arizona GOP Senator Jeff flake the White House they lend to I've limited FBI probe the FBI wrapped up its five day investigation earlier this week\nHere and I think it's got all of this and what lies ahead for judge Kavanaugh and joined by democratic congressman Eric Swalwell he sits on the house Judiciary Committee congressman nice to have you back and say strongly about\nWell earlier today three key senators Democrat Joe Manchin along with Republican Jeff Flake and sue call is all said they would support judge Kavanaugh or when the final vote takes place this weekend so now it appears that he has enough votes to be confirmed what is your reaction to that\nOf you know I'm concerned about the future of the court for its integrity but also for\nYou know the president of important cases like roe versus Wade that they could be overturned but I I also want to make make it clear that you know it's not one senator who did this and I think senator Collins is unfairly being targeted\nShe's one of fifty one who I think I voted in the wrong direction I I Hope people you know remember that as they evaluate you know what this decision I mean to them\nIn the house you know we're not helpless in in what I think we can do any democratic majorities house is the first demand that the FBI reports are made public so we can see if it was a thorough investigation if\nThere isn't it when that we ...\nYeah and the third gaps in with the FBI did if there was this is who we are not contacted who should have been if there were victims who came forward but couldn't reach the FBI or didn't have their phone calls returned we should consider whether we want to interview and investigate them to see if judge Kavanaugh\nDid commit perjury I just think the Supreme Court is supposed to be a court of integrity and we can't have any asterisks or question marks around any justice sitting on the court\nAnd a Democrat Sheryl ... in line to leave the house Judiciary Committee or be the chair of Democrats take the house in November and he's or anything he will call for an investigation of sexual misconduct in perjury allegations but how would you interview Brett Kavanaugh if he's sitting on the U.S Supreme\nCourt why is it the first thing you want to do would be to interview the forty witnesses who have said that they tried to contact the FBI and we're not\nHurt because the administration or the White House and put a leash on the FBI's investigation I think you would want to start there are there's a lot of questions about whether judge Kavanaugh is being truthful as he described his own drinking usually not relevant what someone does in high school or college but when he's saying that there's no way he could have passed out no way he could have committed\nThis crime because he was always uh you know aware of is surrounded well then we want to see if that can be corroborated or a contradicted to a lot of witnesses to interview enforce a victims who said that they were not interviewed like Dr for\nHis confirmation process has divided the nation a lots of people have contacted their Congress numbers over this what have you been hearing from your constituents\nIt's very emotional and I'll I'll just say that I've you know been and back and forth with a very good friends of mine and you know have regretted some of the things that I've said and have tried to pick a step back cannot make it personal but\nYou know the stakes are so high in this allegation is serious I I was a prosecutor for about seven years now into the county and working with sexual assault cases I saw that every sexual assault victim comes forward in a different way\nThey're not given a manual on how you're supposed to be a sexual assault survivor and when you're supposed to come forward or what you're supposed to remember at the time because you may have to recount at a later and I just heard different rings of truth\nFrom Dr Ford as she testified and when I hear people say well wasn't corroborated wasn't carburetor well she is the evidence she's the key piece of evidence that a lotta times crimes occur when there's only one perpetrator and one victim and no one else round\nWell given that you know Republicans are saying you know there's no corroborating evidence against cabin on Democrats are saying the FBI investigation with a sham there were many of these that went and followed out while his reflect on the legitimacy of this whole process\nWell I think the original sin wasn't the failure to give Merrick Garland ushering a couple of years ago when Mitch McConnell did that\nHe made the process of having a Supreme Court nominee go through confirmation\nHard to say is devolved since then to where we are now where a\nFull internal investigation was not conducted or it feels like it was really just rushed through to meet an arbitrary deadline and I just fear was that could mean for the future but Republicans\nHave also accused Democrats of playing dirty politics and all this right\nOf also accused Democrats of playing dirty politics and all of this right but you wanted an FBI investigation you've got wind that now that the result is and what you wanted your attacking the FBI investigation\nThat when we wanted enough during must position but we wanted them to pursue\nAll we did hear that people cold enough to learn and we're never contacted I don't blame the PR article in the administration for the strength to report on the toilet so disappointed with the\nPresident has drawn after the FBI over and over and over these past two years particularly for what they did in an election cycle two years ago and now he puts them right in the box a couple of weeks for another election back hurts their credibility\nAs well All right let's talk about the mid term elections looking ahead if Democrats win the house or will you call for an investigation of a President Trump's taxes in light of the New York times investigation that says a he got the bulk of his money from his father Fred Trump and that he engaged in tax fraud\nTo me this is about credibility and the American people should know if the president is attacks sheet and the New York times went to great lengths than a years long investigation pages laid out in the newspaper or to detail or the president's\nFraud and the the number of different ways to avoid paying taxes like the rest of your calls investigation of the ... what will call for our taxes which is you know refused to release by promising it also just an investigation into\nWhether any money is owed to the U.S government it looks like New York is pursuing their own investigation as to whether any money is owed to the New Yorker reports there's a lot of investigations but the Republicans never conducted whether it was on Russia\nTaxes president cashing in on the oval office that must be conducted in a way that it's fair to everyone not just because we can do it but because the American people deserve to know and no one's above\nAll the cats and move on to some tech issues as well because he also served in the house Internet subcommittee and a Facebook is space here in the bay area of the ...\nThe company recently revealed that there was a hack uh and it affected about fifty million users pluck stolen information could be used to gain access to many other sites where people can use their face what book locking credentials to access those sites\nDo you think that that\nTech companies like Facebook have grown so big that they're now needs to be legislation to bring them in\nYour or do in\nKey piece of legislation about when you're depressed and Congress has to have a national breach notification law right now companies\nTo follow the state laws are forty nine different laws on\nHow you notify consumers of a bridge I think because Facebook you know there are no no state line they are in every state that there should be national standards for women in order for Fox or Facebook or target different companies had breaches that there should be a standard as to when you tell consumers and ideally\nNotification as soon as possible so people can you know defend their own identities against other invasions America All right\nCongressman Eric Swalwell always a pleasure to have you thank you for taking their time\nMoving on to immigration a new federal report as uncovered dangerous and disturbing conditions at an immigration detention center in Southern California the facility in the town of ... is run by the GEO Group a

bed sheets and Fifteen cells they also found detainees were being denied access to timely an adequate medical and dental care\nAlso this week a federal judge in San Francisco block the Trump Administration from ending a program that day protective status to hundreds of thousands of immigrants [noise]\nJoining me now to discuss this our ... anniversary for for a job well Romero and joining us via Skype from Los Angeles is ACLU staff attorney Michael Kaufman welcome to you both\nNow Vickers is Amy has sarcastic with Iran must in a new book\nWelcome to the future which it's mind mosque is well known for being the smoke in an office flamboyant CEO at the company's Tesla and space acts and right now the spectators joins me in the studio and nice to have you here it's great to be here thanks for having me well you know there are lots of tech giants you could have chosen to scare in your book why didn't you choose Avon life\nHe's the funniest he's the weirdest and he's the one that has the most kind of public image you know all these guys hiding their billion dollar ... or whatever where wherever they live\nMuch longer it sweet he's kind of\nOut there he's tweeting is doing stuff so I figure you know\nUh if you're a if you're in the public sphere ah you're going to get multiple that\nWell in your book I knew the number of what you call inspirational quotes from Milan lost and I'm One of them is the key to success is to ask yourself what's the most ludicrous most asinine most feudal thing I could possibly do that make it happen\nWhen you don't like any of his ideas\nOh no I think his ideas are kind of cool like I think on some level you have to admire someone that you satirize but you also have to find them pretty ridiculous because if it's to mean spirited and it's not funny or interesting you know so\n[laughter] have you heard from him ever since you wrote the book no but in fact he has been poaching writers from the onion\nTo create some kind of secret\nComedy enterprise or something\nAnd uh I Know a lot of the people who have poached\nAnd I contacted them to see like what's this project what's going on radio silence his writing a book about you remember the ... yeah that would be a big hit\nEverybody wants to know about me you know I think she's he's shuttling them to his private island and he's going to hunt for sport [laughter] that's what I'm going to have\nA shift in their in a you know really I think it'll take 'em through his\nPrivate it's a planet [laughter] and there's like a you know a human hunting hunting ground there where he and other billionaires like the Trump sons for example can a hunch the most dangerous\n[laughter] All right I think you've got a sequel in the making of the time I mean you also pokes fun at my second per against wow he's not spared your book includes a so called forward from hand\nAh when he said he partake in this book you must quote first gave me all of your personal information it's kind of funny line I tell you think about you know the database they had recently affecting fifty million users\nYeah you know there's so many times you write something and you don't think it's absurd and ridiculous or whatever and then something in real life will happen\nAnd it's like oh I guess it wasn't that absurd after all [noise]\nUh so yeah I Know this was a great opportunity to make fun not just to be alone most but just kind of all of those tech billionaire celebrities basically is what they've become so you know we make fun of bass bass us in there and feel and even Richard Branson gets a couple of hits you know it's fun\nIt's a big check is basically a big model culture now there's there's I mean I don't know much about\nIt like I don't live here and I don't know you know any more than a you know a common mid Westerner would know about it but it strikes me as very amusing and just\nLike people who are sort of living on the on the cusp of the future and wanting to make the future basically a with their inventions and with their money and that's just fascinating\nTo me and aside from check uh we live and politically turbulent times right now does that make satire easier since you seem to have no shortage of targets nowadays\nUh you know that's a that's a hard question um you're interrogating me more than the FBI investigated Brett Kavanaugh\nMovies I like beer [laughter] okay a show like here but you have more than one\nYear old just much prefer for them to treatment for words summing up against people [laughter] so [laughter]\nIt's pretty simple so know satire\nIs easy uh always because there's always terrible people there's always awful things going on in the world and the point of satire is to point those things out with humor and\nSometimes it seems like things are more absurd or things are more crazy I really just think that's a surface like a you know a underneath humans are always going to be pretty awful to each other so things ... there's going to be plenty to satirize and you know what's worse is when\nThings are so absurd that the satire you're right uh just comes true all the time when you think you're writing something crazy and absurd and uh and then it comes true in real life so I don't know it's kind of the gold standard for me when that happens\nYou know written that satire ... afflicts me comfortable and comfort the afflicted can you stand on that how do you decide who are white to target\nYeah so if you go after an oppressed group or somebody who's down and out like it's not funny nobody wants to see that but if you go after authority figures are millionaires or whatever everybody wants to see them brought down a peg so\nYeah it's pretty simple and a lot of times stuff I've done especially suffer the onion has been perceived as very edgy and maybe inappropriate or whatever and that's when\nYou know you might get perilously close to seeming like you're making fun of the wrong target or whatever but the subtext is always going after the the right target hopefully like if you do it right\nWhen there's a true injustice I think ... and that many long\nAbsolutely I'm ... I'm a good guy like I'm not [laughter]\nNot trying to turn it on a long time to get their humor as satire\nAnother great question so humor is just funny like they try not to laugh videos you know on Myrtle slipping and falling in the backyard everybody will have the fat or like you know funny piece by Dave Barry about how you know I I Can't believe I'm fifty\nOr I hate taking out the trash don't you hate taking out the trash that's humor\nBut see that's her well it's funny you know good and it was good jokes but that's her is when you find something wrong with humanity or with the world like you said some kind of injustice\nAnd you pointed out through humor and so there's like a secret nugget nobody wants to be preached to nobody wants to be told what's wrong with them but they don't want jokes so the jokes are like the honey on the moon and the satire you know the sub Texas like the crumpled up medicine that they're getting with the honey\nAnd as you go to create something that's more enriching are laughing maybe maybe even one day and justice is so horrible it's something that navy potentially he held\nYeah 'cause that's the other thing about humor is that it's a really under rated coping mechanism in times of tragedy it's the thing that kind of reminds us that we're human 'cause when there's a tragedy we kind of revert to lizard brain or whatever so yeah I think it's super valuable\nJust real quickly only thirty seconds left but has there ever than a moment you are event that was so dark that and you couldn't build satire from it\nThere's always a good target and almost always and you can use this whole too soon thing but if your target is right it's never too soon like you know that feeling when you're at a funeral and you just start laughing and feels really inappropriate again it's like a natural healing mechanism that we all have so I Love pushing that\nA boundary and trying to get that laugh out as soon as possible\nAll right Scott takers founder of the satirical news outlet the onion and also your new book called welcome to the chair of poking fun at must take so much for being here welcome great to be and that will do for us that's all we can find more of our coverage that cake ... dot org slash newsroom ... thank you for joining us\nOh\nOoh\n[noise]\nUsually program [noise]\nEvery form of life on a planet procedure connected with a human being said in the scheme\nOf things on ... and this is the pulse of the planet [noise]\nOr in line and this is one of the chief should be on the docket council to six nations will likely receive [noise] indigenous cultures are people who have been in one place for a long time\nTo calm the very essence of of where they live and they become very much a part of it because they depend upon the diversity of life around and plants and trees are community they needed one another\nYou cannot take one without damaging the community changing insects and frogs for him to\nFish there are some pendant upon one another there was a change that occurs and so if you're going to interfere with that and you're going to change something you've made changes very dramatic\nProblem with human beings as they don't really understand how their activities like a ring in the water from a federal thrown into still pond as you watch the rings circle out those rings\nMove out into the future so when we have a ... that's a Boulder and upon when we have this burning of the oil\nAnd to wait that's a folder and upon and all of our activities like raindrops on the pond itself human activity you're affecting the future so people have to\nSo I'm an actor they're affecting the future so people have put in those terms [noise]\n\nCongress studious when she saw the British want to hear more\nTrump nominee that he'll be able to say that he put on the court and it's interesting about them again you have to remember a Brett Kavanaugh wasn't on Trump's original list\nOf nominees and there was some machinations to get him on to that list because he's a creature of Washington\nAnd uh uh that Trump wasn't maybe looked at favorably on this but there was this a great victory for Mitch McConnell he was certainly relieved after Susan Collins speech and you know he gave her the shout out said this was an inspirational speech and one of the best speeches I've said in the history of the Senate because it's said to him because if he was going to\nUh the conservative community is you know it's still a little suspicious of Mitch McConnell and the U.S let's talk about that suspicion\nBecause the conservative community in the Senate on the outside they're all watching Cavanaugh a little rattled by what happened with his testimony before center accounts defending judge Kavanaugh's credentials on the Senate floor today the judge said presented his own defense in the wall Street Journal in an op ed he wrote he was quote too emotional\nLast week when senators questioned him and his accuser Dr Christian philosophy for he wrote quote I Know that my tongue was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said he added going forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge in person I have been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even keel open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution\nAnd the public good so he's writing that not for the audience of President Trump's Kelly or for the moderate Republican senator\nGood so he's writing that not for the audience to President Trump Kelly or for the moderate Republican senators like federal eastern mccaskey of Alaska yet Murkowski in the no call\nIt was a big high profile op ed with a very limited audience and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska had also been pretty clear that she had issues\nThat were very home state often when we're trying to understand someone to vote look to their home and for her the Affordable CARE Act preexisting condition something very important in Alaska and there were reasons to be concerned about that and his record and Native American or indigenous people sovereignty\nFederal lands issue that does not come up and a lot of places but in Alaska it matters and matter so much in her own history because her right in a lecture and save one of the greatest comebacks she'd been beaten by\nA Tea Party conservative of the voters in Alaska wrote in all the letters that spell out Murkowski and many of\nThe Alaskan indigenous people were among her most strong supporters and so this was predictable but she was pain and she talked about believing that he's a good man but not the right man in this moment for the corps\nThat the red state Democrats you think about senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota whenever sibling said this week she had to vote no because she needed to be able to look at herself in the mirror when she brushes her teeth\nSwelled from the Republican side in the White House side they were practically gleeful about the way this was playing out because they recognize that was going to put a lot of these red state Democrats an incredibly difficult situation\nBut I think the way she voted and that sort of moral dilemma she seemed to face gets a lot of these issues it wasn't just about a nominee to the Supreme Court or conservative judicial philosophy what you had was issues of um [noise]\nYou know he said she said and temperament and and alcohol abuse or lack thereof and gender and politics and legacy all crashing up against this need to area which is rapidly changing and shifting so the senators weren't just considering\nOne thing they weren't considering only do they believe a cabin I or do they believe Dr forward but they were considering sort of the full spectrum of\nWhat is this vote means for women what does it mean for women who\nWere victims of sexual assault and it was all ... risk ripped into this very potent mix\nAnd it changes the court potentially for generations to come tilted to the right yeah and\nThat's why the stakes are so high especially for someone like high camp\nUm it's her race for much closer I think there's a sense right now that her races really spreading out she's losing\nAnd uh if it were much closer this would actually be a much more difficult decision for her but as it were if she's going to lose there's probably a sense that she ought to make the morally right decision for her about where she wants to court to be going forward but that's why the stakes are so high for Democrats and Republicans right now\nAnd this was the ball game for Republicans I think even if they had lost some political capital in the fight it would have been worth it for someone like Mitch McConnell\nBecause uh you can't get a do over on a Supreme Court to see the next time a seat comes up in may or may not be in trouble term we've already heard talk of if it's in it toward the end of ... like stay open until the next election\nThis could be the last shot and uh they needed to take it because\nThis is changing the court for an entire life despite\nAll the bruises under battering then was involved in this because it was painful for everyone I think when you look at Heidi Heitkamp too you're looking at a woman in the Democratic party who has a future in the Democratic party she may lose her seat but she could easily be the attorney general of the United states under a Democratic president\nShe ... she was she and her home state and I don't think you could survive in democratic politics especially as a woman if you voted for judge Kavanaugh\nAnd so I think she made a choice that she can live with and one that actually I think insurers and greater future for her she might take ... secretary of that too I I'm sure and Jeff Flake\nWho really brought about that moment where\nThe additional week which I think for many people helps to validate the process although the investigation self it's been so attacked by those who don't think it was fair or thorough enough\nBut he's an interesting case he has he has a conservative to the core I'm also trying to bring humanity back to the Senate and the final months of his time\nAnd yet he ended up being a\nRecovering the hamlet of Arizona and all of us who said he ends up at yes questions about the loss it over the urban or the whole process oriented\nThan we have Joe Manchin mantra Democrat in West Virginia talk here so he comes on late ... he walked out way he was waiting to see what happened obviously who he's been very tied to Susan talents in fact he announced his yes vote for confirmation as she ended her speech\nI think I think for Joe mansion that was a good vote for west ... because ... says\nTrump is super popular there he's running right now this is very close to the election I think he was in pretty good shape honestly but I look at this have you gained the south politically it was a smart folks he's a former governor too and he's so he's one of those people who believes in the executive\nRight to make a point let's go back to somebody actually talked about which is President Trump at the rally since because last week President Trump's with Dr Ford testimony was compelling but a few days later he made the decision to mock her during a rally in Mississippi let's take a listen\nI Do it or just a motive is very compelling Richard where she was very credible with this she was very good in many respects how did\nYou get home I don't remember how'd you get removed one [noise]\n\n[noise]\nA man who shot as\nThe White House claimed the president wasn't mocking for just setting the record straight studying turn of events that President Trump kind of be contained in his message and then just go right out there at a rally and go right at Dr Ford was giving cover for Republicans to be more aggressive in their messaging well\nI think what was more stunning was the contained president we saw um but\nI Will say that moment it gave a lot of ... to the Republican establishment on even a number of Trump voters have said they don't like that he said that but what is so stunning to me is that if you talk to people in the president's orbit\nAnd this was not a strategic ... was the president sort of sense in a moment and going for it but they think it was absolutely one of the most valuable and positive things he could've done to help push judge Kavanaugh\nOver the finish line and what they tell us and they say he wasn't mocking her\nBut they say that he he basically pointed out what they argue are fair gaps in her memory I'm\nFair potential problems with her story and in doing so they moved to focus and scrutiny away from judge Kavanaugh's youthful drinking and ... and on to her a little bit and it's sort of gave whether tacitly or overtly\nRepublicans um allies and these outside groups Republican senators\nThe sort of green light to go and be a crack incredibly aggressive and shift that momentum and that's what we saw in these past few days until today's\nVote will remind extend to the Democrats they watch the president and take this kind of message and say the me too movement women voters nationally are going to get up in arms about what's happening as much as Republican voters have their their anger up\nI think the dynamics are so divided along party lines that the president is doing something that he thinks is resonating\nWith his voters and he may very well be right about that at this late stage\nA motivating Republicans to come out is his number one job and I think that's what he was trying to do at that rally in Mississippi and on the Democratic side\nTheir momentum is already pretty high there enthusiasm is already pretty high and I think this needs to moment only amplifies that and it clarifies issues around ... not just some of the policy issues like health care but the cultural issues\nThat the Democrats want to run on but\nPresident Trump is uh I actually sat and giving gave Republicans some key permission not just in the cabinet fight", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "06"}
