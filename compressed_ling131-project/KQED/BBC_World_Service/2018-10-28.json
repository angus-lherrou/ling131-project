[noise] that's one reporter best Murphy wanted to find out\nShe's with the ground truth project based at W. GBH in Boston [noise]\nBest started following this week a crisis when it started two years ago and after Hurricane Maria she began investigating what happened to all this week again\nHere's Beth\nIf you're covering the biggest crisis in Puerto Rico one of the first people you have to me is Dr Carmen ... she asked me to convert Carmen I first interviewed her back in two thousand sixteen when does he get epidemic with exploding she's an OBGYN university hospital in the capital of San Juan\nNo way that looks like\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI've wanted to understand the politics behind Z get ever since I started following it two years ago and I did everything I could think of to talk to someone from the health department at first I called [noise]\nLike [noise]\nSpanish when I worked I showed up at their offices again and again\nI mean the problem is I mean I've been to there's often many times now in person and also called\nWas in the\nFinally I tracked down the assistant secretary of health Dr Concepcion can notice long ago we meet in the hallway of the convention center where she's speaking at a press conference about a new lunch program and just like the doctor said she's quick to give me the government's official line ... that the crisis is over\nSo far we are not detecting Neal case [noise] ah oh see that on our faith epidemiology they'll son expect to have cases right now\nI asked her why the health department had stopped testing pregnant women physique up this is what every doctor I spoke to told me she says that's not true that the health department is performing the tests and has been just a few weeks after the hurricane\nTheir money out we try to make sure ah samples collected all over the line where ... percent but I Love what I thought he said that if our mental health on one with ...\nAnd these are samples where sent a do they see that what I thought he seemed to state because our lab would have thought ... was damage\nI checked with the CDC and they told me that never happened the health department and never since ... samples to Atlanta for analysis but doctor can notice is adamant that the testing is back on\nWhere not only ... female\nThey follow up on a couple of things I'm certainly the testing of pregnant women the movie Julie and that I was talking with they didn't seem to think they had a clear handy some health department to be that thing or that there was a way to get those test results back that Monday\nAccess she blames the doctors for dropping the ball their side of the nation in rabbit or his his um we don't have that close contact with them to make sure they do did they seem they shouldn't um\nDon't you can also tells me that women tend to be tested but I found out later that testing is no longer free women now have to pay one hundred dollars and the other thing is last year the government said the crisis was over so why would a woman even after the town and\n\nNone of them for something else when we'll all that data on developmental delays in ... babies be released\nI think ah there will be some information released\nThis is the kind of answer I get from doctor to known as an almost everything we talk about she's hard to pin down and by the end of the conversation she tells me that she needs to get permission from her boss the health secretary before she can share any more details\nIt's not that I can talk to anybody opening without being authorized because\nBecause we want to have a the correct message\n\nAfter we part ways I'm left standing in that convention center hallway and starts to become clear to me is that the health department doesn't want to talk about the guy with me or even their own top the doctors several doctors told me they stopped hearing from the health department altogether\n\n\nIn Thailand doctors like Carmen ... and Cynthia Garcia started wondering why why was it so important for the government to make the get go away or Cynthia says they think it comes down to money\nThere's no question you know that the the guy that make the notion of having a sick of it and my care effect that all of us in terms of tourism\nTourism it's the lifeblood of the island I reach out to the Puerto Rico tourism association and talk to the organizations president and CEO Clarissa Jimenez about how much ... affected the island\nAnd was a huge in fact\n... remembers when the CDC first issued warnings about the ... in Puerto Rico in two thousand sixteen\nTheir numbers they weren't even were really really high and scary and we had lots of calculations and you know there was\nThe first section that you would do that here and you would get the virus in because that was what was portrayed you know those huge percentages of the population and getting the virus\nTourists stayed away and the island lost one hundred million dollars and that she says should have happened\nOh let me see how this so [laughter] they're reality set a lot of hype was created\nAfter Hurricane Maria the government wanted to build back the tourism economy as quickly as possible and doctors I talked with believe that meant getting rid of the guys\nFrom\nDr Carmen ... know that we get it's doing brand so she's found a way to restart testing of pregnant\nWomen physique and I feel this is so important to be able to identify because most of their patients who I think I Do not have any symptoms and ... and they have gotten a might be at risk for breast seething\nCarmen did an end run around Puerto Rico's health department she teamed up with the CDC to provide free testing for pregnant women it's the only program I get on the island\nSo many outlets starting to think I think today and you have threatened that's\nOn the first day back in the spring eight women had their blood drawn including last us it's always been a concern\nI've seen people sick with the hat and did you know when the hurricane started your financial I found out I was struggling with this way now but [noise]\nDon't call it maybe maybe not [laughter] that that I think\nThat's named ... native from their birth rate you see the now while here [laughter]\nIn the new testing continued through the summer and it's still going today doctors say the\nFirst results are in and even though it's a small sample there alarming\nNine percent of women are testing positive that's almost with the rate was at the height of the epidemic\nOn his time the time they researcher I'm not ready for anybody because the seashore and therefore I can only name Wendy evidenced asked me to say\nAnd the evidence is telling Carmen ... is a very real danger today for pregnant women and babies in Puerto Rico around twenty six thousand women will give birth this year so far fewer than three hundred have been tested for the ...\nI mean has Patricia for when I'm thirty six years I've been blessed are being for instance for their various of so many babies and I got to tell you that the first thing I Will might ask my baby\nI think he's a ... ... they said that we need to do it and we need to the day right thing\nAnd\nThat story was from best Murphy if the ground truth project and she's the director of films there and also has a short film coming out about this story and\nWe check with the CDC about a week and Puerto Rico one of the epidemiologist told us that the risk of getting ... now is less than during the outbreak a couple of years ago but the virus will always be there people need to protect themselves from ... in sexual transmission to avoid getting infected\nMm [noise] in a moment we hit back to the mainland Houston, Texas where a year after Hurricane Harvey ... people who are using a government program to pay for housing or getting the door

very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious in the program does that suggest that there's that there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this guarantee that everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it\nStill
