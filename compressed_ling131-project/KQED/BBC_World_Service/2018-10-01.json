{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KQED", "content": "Tonight to ten thirty [noise] good evening I'm Sandy Alta house thanks for listening to members supported radio [noise]\n'kay Q. E. D. San Francisco and cake Huey I north highlands Sacramento on line we're at ... dot org the time now is nine PM\n[noise]\nFrom ... public radio this is political breakdown ... politics reporter Scott\nShafer ... senior politics editor and today we cleared the show to focus on the extraordinary historic some might say exhausting Supreme Court nomination hearing the pretty much transfixed the nation\nThat's right and in the center of this hearing at a very long trying they were a number of Californians notably Christine Blasey Ford who accused of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulting her back in high school she's from the bay area\nShe is and of course the California's two U.S senators Dianne Feinstein come all Harris are both members of the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd you know I I think we saw and we've talked about this before on the show the very different styles of these two women I Dianne Feinstein is the ranking member she um is a lot about decorum she is not the prosecutor the calmly Harris says and I think we saw those differences\nWe totally did and um I think ah I was struck can we talk with the newsroom was you know just basically stopped him was watching the hearing this afternoon and you know I was struck by how many\nOn flattering references there were to Dianne Feinstein mostly from Republican member ranking member I can remember didn't do this you didn't do this you didn't know why don't you hold this letter and uh I didn't feel with Senator Feinstein was not her finest moments you did not really a defend herself in fact we got a statement from her\nAfter the hearing I'm saying much stronger and stronger statement but it really I think did leave you wondering why she didn't say some of those things during the hearing\nYeah and I think just seem to be part of the Republican strategy to sort of focus on the process here instead of on the allegations that idea that you know and and this was a pushback to Democrats who were very focused on this question of why there hasn't been an FBI investigation\nI Want to play you um to back to back cuts of our senators from California asking about this FBI investigation story um and you can just hear their different styles\nIf you're very confident of your position and you appear to be why aren't you also asking the FBI to investigate these claims\nCenter all do whatever the committee once I wanted a hearing the day after the allegation came up\nI wanted to be here that day instead ten days past where all this nonsense is coming out\nYou know dominant gangs on boats in Rhode Island I'm In Colorado you know side it all over the place and these things are planted and run for sleep on cable news\nYou know I wanted to hearing the next day my family's been destroyed by this senator destroyed and on and whoever wants to you know whatever the committee decides Yom all all mall in student ... immediately I'm all in a medium or\nAre you willing to ask the White House to authorize the FBI to investigate the claims that have been made against ya well I'll do whatever the committee wants and I've heard you say that but a witness it makes us I've not heard you answered very specific question that's been asked which is are you willing to ask the White House\nConduct an investigation by the FBI to get to whatever you believe is the bottom of the allegations that have been levied against you\nThe FBI would gather witness statements you ...\nIf it's if they do not I don't want to debate with you how they do their business I'm just asking are you willing to ask the White House to conduct such an investigation because as you are aware the FBI did conduct a background investigation\nInto the you know for we were aware of these most recent allegations so are you willing to ask the White House to do that and say yes or no and then we can move on but six background\nInvestigations over twenty six years or\n... as it relates to the recent allegations are you willing to have them delivered to a witness testimonies before you know witness who was there supports that I was there I'm going to take that as a no and we can move on\nAnd so you can just hear the style there and I mean you know I think it's important to note the reason that it was important for them to move him along with that they only have five minutes he\nWell exactly and I think that's a cabin on him and you know others who testified before Congress you know they they know that they can run out the clock if they can just extend their answers and ... or ... exactly and ah you know a common errors called him on that uh and managed to get another few questions in but still five minutes not very\nLong now and we're going to hear a lot more we have a great seller panel here to analyze it\nI'm quickly though first uh Scott and they did seek to former California's a Senator Barbara boxer a bit earlier today we want to get her reaction having been in Congress for two decades morning in the year the woman after the unusual exactly box so here's our interview with Barbara Boxer\nSenator Barbara boxer thank you so much for joining us\nThank you for having me on so I guess probably\nI'd like to just start and ask what's your general reaction to what happened today in Washington and and what happened in this hearing\nFirst of all the within exhausting day for I think all of those who watch this what dad that to me it's not just that he was really to the Democratic senator that bad enough but it does opening statement he filled with anger and screaming and yelling and I heard\nOne female attorney said my God mentioned it that was a woman they would've dragged her out of there\nOn the other hand you talk about judge Kavanaugh's anger or Clarence Thomas was quite angry and Nineteen Ninety One as you recall I'm sure he called it a high tech lynching it was very angry and he got confirmed and got the votes of you know several Democrats\nWell let me just say I think you're right to bring that up\nBecause I said on television just a few minutes ago that I felt that just to catch Kavanaugh was like Clarence Thomas was crying I mean it's just very strange but what Twenty years then\nFor goodness sake we have come a long way that I don't know what else to tell you a little angry he was attacking it that they need help with they're not attacking her saying she mixed up and it was mistaken identity\nYou know they're not going after her that much they learn it twenty seven years Republicans couldn't find one woman to put on the Judiciary Committee so what I said\nYeah twenty seven years ago uh this kind of a charge was uh [noise] what can I get the horrible things that\nThat it needed he'll get the march twenty twenty seven years later with the me too movement um one can only hope\nThat it would be taken much more seriously and that there is no place for anger here\nSo you've spent time on committee is questioning witnesses I'm curious what you thought about your former colleagues Senator Dianne Feinstein performance today there was a lot of attacks on her from Republicans about the timing of when you know this allegation\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream button the trends but AC Transit connect the vibrant resilient and diverse members of the East Bay to the scene that drive them\nSpeech grants but a part of the community more and more ... the transit dot org slash ride ACT\nRanking member it wasn't on the Judiciary Committee I think Diane handle herself with toys and calm she stayed at the truth which was that went back and forth came forward\nDr Ford for and in in the tea she gave her that it wasn't until this was all week and they would go to the press story that Dr Ford side go public\nSentiment I told the truth about that and the truth is\nAnd I said it on the house between the two for thirty four years the bottom line is if you work as it asked for and then that that is your\nYou need to do that you don't want to politicize the pain of the ... hit you shouldn't you shouldn't ever do that and if you do it you shouldn't be in public life\nUh one last question you were swept into office in the year of the woman following those Anita Hill Clarence Thomas hearings what do you think this is going to have on the electorate\nPredict what going to see a pink ways I think we're going to see a many many women\nAnd we know that over two hundred women are running for the house so I Do expect if you if you get hooked together you know this president to\nMean women attacked women doesn't care about women you look at the women's march which was the largest march in history and you look at what is happening here and the fact that we're publication side of the Judiciary Committee\nDidn't even have one woman what the hell you are if health care we need\nA it's just that was the method when I ran and I want to be totally honest without any detail I Would never have gotten elected it with her courage to to come forward with this painful story just as Dr forget that had residents with\nOr do you want to say that we tried our producer ... he'd moved quite a few calls this afternoon we were looking for somebody to defend a judge Kavanaugh I'm really there was no one uh one person who I think that I don't want to put my head on the block\nOr you know but we did really try and it was just the people really at least at least with the halfway point over here and didn't really want to do that [noise]\nCan you or you are a horse covered the me too movement and what was happening up here in Sacramento and\nKevin do we all ... who's running against a Senator Feinstein of course in has tried to make her handling of this letter from Dr Ford an issue um I Know you've been talking with some of the leaders of the uh we said enough movement up there were you hearing from them in terms of how they're viewing all those\nWell support\nFor Dianne Feinstein um it it's an interesting political situation up here I think you know Kevin de Leon I'm as we've seen from the latest polls he has some ground to make up against Dianne Feinstein I you know she is a long term incumbent um\nAnd so he is going out on a limb and he he issued a statement saying that um\nHer failure to turn over the letter or to make her colleagues aware of the letter that she received from Dr Ford was a failure of leadership and um you know coming hard against her\nWhich is I think um you know it's\nFor lack of a better word a dairy for somebody who really ... yeah risky when he was president of the Senate\nUm there were our president pro tem of the Senate that's when we saw all of these allegations come forward I mean and there are people who could say hey man you didn't know it was going on in your own\nBackyard you know he lived with senator Tony Mendoza a when he was up here in Sacramento who and of course senator Mendoza ultimately resigned following a sexual harassment allegations against him so I think a Kevin de Leon plan to try and maybe make some\nMake some hay out of this backfire to bed and when I reached out to his campaign they actually\nPushed back pretty hard and said you know we made the statement before we knew Dr forwards identity we said we never said that her identity should be compromised\nBut it wasn't something that they really wanted to talk about and I have to say I made a lot of calls to people who've endorsed a Kevin de Leon and I didn't get a lot of calls back on this story [noise]\nUm I Want to remind our listeners that you are listening to political break down from ... public radio Emory so law goes along with Scott Shafer we're focusing today on the judge Kavanaugh hearing\nUm we are joined by Kay cutie politics and government reporter Katie Orr I'm from Oakland via Skype is lily ... borrow a staff writer for slate and from Lausanne\nSkype is lily blue for borrow a staff writer for slate and from Los\nAngeles Leo ... at Loyola Law school professor laundry\nJessica eleventh and it had just got to you because one thing we heard from both judge Kavanaugh in a lot of his defenders on the um especially on the right today was the issue that Mike Judge who was allegedly a witness to this incident um did you know give a statement to the committee saying that this did not happen\nUm and you know they seem to feel that this ... but that was sufficient that that he didn't need to come testify um and that this was sort of the cooperation that proved the judges point over Dr Ford I mean what's your reaction to that\n[noise] my reaction to that is that it's just\nAnother example of how we need to be very clear that the Senate hearings are in no way a trial and that is frankly something that I don't think passes the smell test for the hearings but certainly would never pass the smell test when it came to an actual court hearing any thought to senators\nOver and over again reminds both witnesses you're not on trial here even though that's what it felt like so what do you have the senator say what we have a written statement by someone\nWho had every reason in the world do\nNot want to be part of this and who clearly does not want to come to testify and we'll take them at its word\nI think that's really not giving credence then\nTo the other people who have said the opposite when it comes to Dr Ford allegations or to the other accusers who frankly have been telling a very consistent story and so I think the problem for judge Kavanaugh this morning is that the heart of his defense was\nNot my character there is no way that I could have ever done this and he had this letter as support frankly not enough support and the users we're going to the heart of that defense saying\nNo you absolutely are that type of person and painting a very consistent picture\nThat a problem I think for judge Kavanaugh to afternoon is a lot of us watch that and just thought\nThat his response even if he absolutely believes what he's saying this is just simply not somebody who should be sitting on the ice ... land\nYou don't know of course how this is going to turn out there will be a committee vote I'm told we're learning tonight or tomorrow and then perhaps a floor vote as soon as Saturday I'm\nAnd I'm just wondering I'm gonna ask Louisville and then Katie uh what\nDo you think that depending on how this turns out a really what do you think the political fallout here will be for the midterms which you just you know what five weeks away\n[noise] yeah I I think yeah I think\nThe effect of that is on the terms is going to be dramatic and I think that there is a real danger that at\nThe level of anger among women and feminist men is a is hard to overstate and I'm asked after ... after that abominable performance this man is concerned I and a concerned\nAbout what will happen but Katie I mean we're also hearing a lot of pushback from Republicans that they really they they feel angry too and then this you know I could serve to energize them especially if it goes down yeah\nYeah I mean I think it could um I had a spoken to someone who was raising that\nI'm raising that possibility too that if if if jumps Kavanaugh is confirmed and\nThat will be a rallying cry for Republicans to get out to the polls because again you know as was when Trump was running the Supreme Court seat that is a big motivator for a lot of people\nUm I Will say as you all know I've been a reporting on women running for office for the first time and most of them uh were inspired by the twenty sixteen election of President Trump\nAnd we're seeing a movement now of largely progressive democratic women running some for the very first time\nA and I really think that the hearing today is going to add a lot of fuel to that fire and I would not be surprised if\nMore women running the future I as we saw with the Anita Hill a testimony ... Barbara Boxer to run for office I mean I think we're seeing not again here and I would be surprised if women don't turn out to vote in large numbers in in the coming weeks\nYeah and we heard today that the um national sexual assault hotline saw almost one hundred and fifty percent increase over a normal volume on Thursday so I think that that speaks to this just go to a less than a minute left um but I'm curious I mean if Kavanaugh is confirmed and Democrats did retake Congress and the Senate would they have any recourse\n[laughter] well you have the same recourse for a sitting judge a on the Supreme Court that you would have for any others sitting federal judge or parts of the United states I mean the recourse could be impeachment\nThat is extremely rare I mean we can essentially count on one or two hands for the number of times in our nation's history\nThat a federal judge has been in college and convicted by the Senate as we know\nFrom the example of President Clinton impeachment alone doesn't mean that you're on the profit you already have to be convicted by the Senate and so that that's a long after the short answer your question is do I think something is going to is there any recourse no vaccine judge Kavanaugh will be very straight in about that\nWe're going to have to leave it there ... or a slate lily loose borrow and loyal loss was just\nEleventh and thank you all so much that is going to do it for this edition of political break down a production of ... public radio our producer is ... and our engineer a seal\nMuller movies are managing editor holy colonels or vice president of News I'm Scott Shafer you can follow me\n... and ... next week we'll be back with a very special interview with lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom we're hoping to get John Cox on here too you can find me on Twitter I'm an epilogue of that is a rap for this week's political breakdown for ... we hope to see you next time\nWise [laughter]\nSupport for gay Q.

over a host of issues including immigration and whether to me all the gas tax as part of our election coverage cake and eat politics a senior editor Scott Shafer sat down with more than ... earlier\nGoing to govern you some good to have you got to be here I Want to begin by talking about this story that has riveted the country this week and that as the hearings with Brett Kavanaugh on Christine Blasey Ford what's the most important take away free from all this not just this week\nA divided and polarize we are as a country fundamentally how we're talking past each other and\nAlmost got a sense it doesn't matter what either side says it is not a great moment in our history a part of the\nConversation with Brett Kavanaugh was his schooling and he went to Catholic schools as you did he talked about your Catholic and of course the church again is embroiled in this abuse scandal and I'm just wondering\nIf you feel like California should join New York and New Jersey and do an independent investigation of abused by not just\nPriests but also employees I grew up in the church I I Would have no trouble with that whatsoever\nAt all ah anecdotally a and you know directly I I I don't you know I don't want to manifest any\nIntrigued on my own experiences but as an altar boy and a those early childhood memories but you know uh yeah\nI think that is absolutely appropriate under the circumstance and there's no additional moral threshold that you can advance because you sit there communion a and somehow can be forgiven if those sends you need to be held accountable for them\nTo talk about your campaign for governor [laughter] your campaign it's changed a little bit but the the slogan but it's basically courage for a change and with a period after courage now a ... it's sort of implies that maybe Jerry Brown didn't have courage on some issues are that you're going to have different priorities like\nTalk about the how will you be different from Jerry Brown in terms of those priorities\nAnd look I'm not here to critique dairy products they want to compliment enemy is a master politician needed an extraordinary job is the right person at the right time\nA tree eyes the state uh he is putting us back on firm footing that said there are vaccine issues in the state that are going to require courage and I just want to change in terms of approach the homeless issues out of control it's\nInexcusable it's unacceptable twenty four percent of the nation to almost a hundred and thirty four thousand people on the streets and sidewalks we need to address at the housing issue the affordability crisis in this day on mortgages rents they're out of control with forty nine out of fiftieth and per capita housing units it's going to require\nA different strategy different framework and that's what I'm arguing when you were\nMayor of course homeless this was a issue big issue it still is you try to tackle it with care not cash and some other things and as you well know you can take five thousand people off the streets and get 'em and housing I was going to be another five thousand people often from other counties or other states and so\nHow do you deal with that on a regional or state wide basis you have to hold do you have to hold these counties accountable\nI Love your question because you're framing it as it needs to be framed it's a national problem manifesting in the state to state problem manifesting in regions regions manifesting in the city's a city mayor cannot solve this or his or her self you've got a regionalized strategies when I mean by regionalized is accountability\nIf San Francisco is the only one in the entire nine county bay area that's doing all the right things that's kind of place much pressure on the city and county in San Francisco\nAnd that pressure needs to be equally share audio for that for regional plants regional strategies incentivized good behavior disincentive eyes bad behavior\nWe laid out literally a dozen specific strategies to address these issues or we want a cabinet secretary homeless as ours sorts I Want to be held accountable the timelines objectives are and real delivered balls and regionalized strategies to help support local efforts\nYou've also made a childcare and universal preschool for all California kid the priority wise that so important\nZero to three eighty five percent of the brain is formed by the time you're three uni prenatal focus you need early headstart focused nursing home visits for first time others\nThe power of reading to your kids talking to your kids counting and singing to your kids that's not a government program that's an educational strategy the achievement gap starts before you enter kindergarten if we're going to get serious about education reform criminal justice reform you've got to begin at the beginning and that's a big part of our emphasis you're\nDoing that ah I'm not sure what the price tag is but you've also talked about universal or single payer healthcare which has a big big price tag Vermont tried it uh they gave up Bernie Sanders home state so like how are you going to pay for it and and what do you need to do to actually make it out\nI think the difference here doing that effort in Vermont and what we're experiencing here in California is we're already spending at least according to UCLA three hundred and sixty seven point five billion dollars a year already on health care by some estimates as over four hundred billion\nWe have a population is larger than a hundred and sixty three nations uh we have a robust health care delivery system in this day we truly are a nation state in some my core beliefs is out any expenditure that's roughly Seventy ... percent\nA single payer financed already that we can address that remaining thirty per se or an address the anxiety that waste and inefficiency in a multi payer system bankrupting the state huh\nAddress the anxiety that waste and inefficiency multiplayer system bankrupting the state health care is bankrupting the state of California the next governor has to have a plan on healthcare you can't escape it\nOr we've seen huge premium increases the AC has been vandalized by Trump the Trump Administration the end of the individual mandate the introduction these jumps plans skinny plans increasing premiums for the rest of us I'm committed I think to making sense of a single payer financing approach\nOne of the criticisms of Democrats generally uh even from some other Democrats in the middle part of the country is that the there are too many coastal elites who is the phrase that they use who\nTalk down to the rural parts of the country that red states the fire mistakes and you could say that if you're living in you know reading or a you know to ... county or any of those counties up north and went to the east\nWhat do you use it and you learn that are as you know the tests were driving ...\nNews I talk about this all the time 'cause I agree with that\nAnd I think we are to be very careful Democrats never talked to anyone\nQuite the contrary I mean everyone wants to be universally protected connected respected\nYou talked to someone you're not respecting them\nAh people want to be connected to many different ways forums and look I grew up in a very interesting reality I divorced mom living here in the city San Francisco but my dad living one of the ... parts of California plaster county and so I have a deep appreciation insensitivity to folks living in rural California is a big part of my life\nYou know a couple of issues that come to mind around this is the environment a greening you know you hear the whole country you know they're afraid of good clean energy a gas tax that kind of thing I mean so bring it down to the reality is being governor Mike how do you what do you say to folks who live in those parts of it\nI'm never met anyone that wants to turn on the top and south's brown water coming out are toxic water I've never met anyone who wants to go outside\nUh bring their kids to school breathing dirty air so I think he's talking in those terms and they may not believe in quote unquote global warming which I remember it was part of an actor and now it's climate change a hoax manmade or otherwise you get into those debates you might lose folks but if you focus on those fundamental issues I think you could bring people back into the broader fold\nIf you're elected house California you got to be different in four years than it is today\nWell I Hope we can just this issue the issue of our time outside the extra central issue of climate change the issue of wealth disparity in income disparity social mobility the California Dream Nineteen percent supplemental poverty index in the state\nIs unacceptable cannot be the wealthiest and the poor state more ... no it's not about taxes and for me it's about real strategies to address these issues with zero three is a long term strategy dealing more with the earned income tax credits or other strategies that we've laid out\nA but again these are for a year plans or nothing could have happened overnight to address the crisis of affordability but hopefully over the course of the term uh I think we're all made real progress and viruses you\nTurn to govern evolution thanks so much for coming in\nTo be\nNow

I started reading a letter in the first thing that my father said you know dear Shani and dismayed at I'm telling you that your brother and they had to had passed away and I got I just stopped there and I started crying and I probably went crazy I don't know\nMy mom then called or other brothers to ask what happened\nBut nobody wanted to say anything but later on my brother he said to me when we went in the Senate tea or some sunnier so I'm In one came and took to me and he said you know we know and you can find any so just even liked that\nAlex was in college at the time so instead of wielding the gun he was in charge of recruiting in educating students to the group's political ideology Alex remained a member of the far until Nineteen Ninety six and it's sort of administrative position never in combat a year later\nCentral America's longest and most brutal civil war has come to an end for the past thirty six years left us rebels Bible Guatemala's army\nPiece was finally negotiated between the government and the various guerrilla groups so he left the armed forces and it's part of the peace accord all guerillas had to present themselves before the local United Nations mission to formally accept a deal but when I went to his name was called he stood up and was shocked by what the woman reading his name said to him\nAnd he who in a split released because they'll stinky so yo yo man when it comes to them and they'll be able to ...\nThe woman told Alex that he can possibly be the man she called he said yeah that's me I'm a humdrum and those are the woman told them but you died in Nineteen Seventy eight Alex asked a woman to read the maternal last name of the man on her list\nWhat is your little bail everyone vale does may get off a little more than\nShe said Marta ... it I mean by that turnout looks realized she was talking about his father Alex Heard the un read off the name of two more family members that day\nBut it wasn't sure whether to believe that so many relatives were secretly ... and ...\nIt will just in the early ... at least that's what I see the ... and yet then\nI like the guerilla fighters inflated their membership rolls of innocent civilians since they would seem bigger than they really were even if those civilians that no affiliation with the insurgent groups in real life so it was difficult to know whether my uncle ... or anyone else in the family was actually involved in the war [noise]\n\nLike me my cousin's curiosity grew with he got older and a few years later he started his own investigation into what really happened to his dad his quest to come to a method line the town where the family recovered his father's body\nHe spoke to a retired gorillas in the area and local law enforcement and the stories he pieced together it was very different than the one ... suits told me this story makes more sense if you consider how dangerous Guatemala was in those days and why my family might have wanted to hide the real reasons for my uncle's death\nWhen you look at you already way I mean if I become a big area for you if you get your ... and we're not seeing\n... from what Alex discovered him for his dad died on a farm or trying to collect the famous war tax the war taxes with the gorillas charts farms in rural areas to help support themselves but it was mostly imposed on people so it was more like extortion and donations and this is where it gets complicated\nSomebody must have alerted the locals that my uncle and his friends were coming\nBecause when they arrived members of the military would there waiting for them one million in that I don't flip don't give us a lot of [noise]\nYeah ... new book is was helping me if I was going on with that ... ...\nPeople ambushing them and grabbed his father as soon as they entered the farm you know they have the alec says this is where his father was killed me about that a seat on my thought on them I see that\nHad my uncle um that her to death with a machete have like the actor's knack they have to check into his heart hung out of his ... his picture than adequate awesome if waiter [noise]\n\nSo one version of the story has my uncle dying in a bar fight one that started because of the love\nSo one version of the story has my uncle dying in a bar fight one that started because of a love triangle and ended with the government accusing my uncle of being a guerilla fighter\nThe other version is that he was the guerilla fighter who was extorting people and ended up mutilated by the military given how different these two stories are I asked my cousin about the origins of the ... story after all the borrowing version wasn't in any newspaper it was what my uncles told us\nAnd NATO but as soon as I mean a ... they look at the actual city of ... up I thought I Would go back to\nMy cousin said that after his father died people threaten the family and told them all not to talk about what happened Alex things maybe this is when our family decided to tell the love triangle story instead and he says it's okay for them to have their version he's keeping his\nScares again because if you don't get your medical me what you\n... ... ... ...\nI don't know if any and my uncle Alondra with a hero or a villain I'd heard that the fog of war treat situations like my uncles were the trees can be down\nBut I didn't expect was that people could come to prefer the slog\nFor my mom actually debating such awful stories about her brother is something she wants to avoid which is partly why she's only returned to Guatemala a handful of times in the last forty years\nAnd I noticed that some people said that to me right one that was the one what are your pets I don't want a ball\nThat I don't remember the stuff\nIt's strange to hear my mom said that\nBy naming the after my uncle my mum ensure that neither of us would ever forget his murder\nNames like memories can be powerful\nThings to reporter and Jesse and they had the control for that story Mm\nAnd now we're going to turn to an interview that I recently did with one of the most know where the names in hip hop history in the early Nineteen nineties or young

C. dot org\nMhm welcome back to Latino USA ... wholesome\nWhen we talk about pollution we often think about our physical health things like our lungs are skiing but what about our brains\nJust this last year a nationwide study was released the first of its kind\nThat looked at the euro logical effects of pollution on children in schools across the country the researchers tested for exposure at around eighty five thousand US public schools and they found that the schools with large black and brown populations\nWere disproportionately affected by pollution\nI sat down with Sarah Elizabeth ... who co wrote the study to talk about her findings were nephews based in Salt Lake City Utah but I decided to start first or recording my own observations of pollution outside of our officers in Harlem and I asked Sarah for her and pressure\nSo it's one or two in the afternoon [noise] we're right here on a hundred and twenty fifth street you can hear the announcement of the\nBus right behind us so one bus well let me see I see\nOne small little I'm kind of hospitals bus\nA small bus right behind that [noise]\nA regular city bus behind that a van a truck another double size was and this is just\nOne second on a hundred and twenty fifth street\nYeah I mean it sounds like you're located right there in the center of\nA lot of traffic and you know city life I mean Salt Lake city we also it's a pretty big city here we have you know a fair amount of traffic pollution and buses and everything but when I was actually thinking about when you were talking about what's outside are just all of the health risks associated with those different exposures that you were hearing\nAnd not only the respiratory risks for our breathing but also you know cardiovascular effects and what my research has been focusing on which is you know neurological effects and how air pollution actually can harm our brain\nSo that gets really scary I got to be honest because I I'm like ooh okay first of all I feel like a terrible mother because I dared raised my kids in New York City in Harlem\nBut also it just makes me wonder about what this has done to my own brain so where do you mean exactly 'cause that sounds quite shocking and quite scary\nSo working theory now coming from neurologist is that when you breathe in the pollution for example through your nose and it damages the nasal along EPA steely am and allows the pollution to enter your body\nThat then generates an immune response which causes tissue swelling and immune cells release of federal toxic species and then it can lead to diffuse loss and damage of neural tissues\nOkay and for those of us like okay I was raised with a scientist so I got a little bit of that but then there was a lot of people were like okay I feel like I lost some brain cells just getting that interpretation\nWould it really means is that if you're breathing in air that's contaminated it can find its way to your brain and and essentially you're saying it slows us down well\nYeah it causes inflammation which damages our brain and changes the way that it functions there is a medical doctor she's at the University of Montana Dr ... guys who joined us and she actually does work in Mexico city\n[laughter]\nAnd she does autopsies on otherwise healthy youth that are basically you know killed in traffic accidents that or other accidental does and she looked at their brains and she's compared their brains to the brains of you\nWho have died of similar causes in less polluted Mexican cities like better crews and she basically finds that they have brain structures that resemble people who have early stage all glamorous disease [laughter] so she can actually visually see\n[laughter] does she can actually visually see in the brains of these young people\nThese changes which she believes are tied to the air pollution that the children must be you know breathing in as they live their lives in heavily polluted city like Mexico City\nSo in the report the term environmental justice is talked about a lot mhm and it's been around for a while but just to make sure 'cause there are different definitions what exactly in your view is your definition of environmental justice\nWell the paper that we published and environmental research takes a perspective on distribution all environmental injustice which which has to do with how\nYou know how harming pollution is distributed in space and then how certain social groups are disproportionately exposed to that pollution and our neighborhoods or in our paper in their schools\nSince her just to kind of and on this concept of environmental justice what might just has looked like for for these communities that are challenged\nI think it's really tricky because we can just shift the pollution around [noise]\n[noise]\nThere's evidence that as you might environmental justice movement was achieving some success and the Nineteen seventies in the Nineteen eighties\nWhere you know our backyards we're getting at least somewhat cleaner in certain parts of the United states that basically what was happening with these burdens like waste incineration was shifting from the United states do other country\n[noise] so it's not in my backyard versus not on planet earth right and I think moving towards that nope not on planet earth whereby we make very conscious decision to protect our children you know remedy environmental injustices that have been perpetrated against people of color in this country for a very long time\nHas to happen in terms of reducing the pollution everywhere and for everyone and not just you know shifting it on to some other less powerful person who doesn't have to deal with that [noise]\n\nThere are thank you so much for all of your research we really appreciate it thank you [noise]\nThere are Elizabeth ... is one of the researchers behind the national pollution study she's a researcher and professor at the University of Utah [noise] and now for
