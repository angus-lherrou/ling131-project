Kaye queuing I FM north islands Sacramento the time now he's nine PM\n[noise]\nFrom taking any public radio this as sort of a breakdown memory saliva take immediate politics reporter and I'm Scott\nShafer through the senior politics editor and today we are excited to have San Francisco district attorney George guests go and join us on the brake yeah\nThat's going to a former cop turned prosecutor has been a vocal proponent of many of the controversial criminal justice reforms of recent years but just recently he announced that he will not seek another term as da setting his mother's ailing house\nAnd we'll be talking to him about that very difficult and personal decision also about the state of criminal justice here in California maybe what it's like being the odd man out at district Attorneys Association meeting\nI'm interested in that I could never see the ads I can tell you they don't always agree but we'll get to that in a second first we want to talk about the news of the week and um we're actually sitting in the studio was where some of the biggest political news happened this week which was the governor's debate Scott Shafer moderated did John Cox and ... some and um\nYou know I it's supposed to be at this point the only debate we're going to have 'em and I guess I'm curious you were you were sitting on the scene I'm actually in right\nNow um I don't know what pressures were you happy with the way it turned out and you\nKnow you know going into it I mean we knew we had an hour and there were so many competing\nConsiderations you know in terms of what the cover what to talk about we wanted to make sure that we had time to talk about some of the big issues like housing ah but ah you know it was interesting the very beginning we brought them both in here and John Cox from sitting here and Gavin Newsom was sitting there\nAnd we have about three minutes until broadcast began and they immediately started arguing about debates [laughter]\nI Would talk to you know it's too bad this is the only debate and you knew some it was like well you know you canceled on CNN there was like what was going to be and it's yeah I don't think a lot of love lost between us you know and then there were a couple of breaks like minute on breaks during the our\nSilence yeah like we should\nShut down because if you look at you know I think there was a very hot hard fought primary on the Democratic side of the open primary but you know between the ... the former mayor and and new some\nUm but you could see you know they've been in politics they've been around the same circles and so I think that there is at least on the surface a little more friendliness between those guys during some of the primary debates\nNone of that in Iraq you know what interested me is that there was a couple of months I was sitting in the control room and I stood up to watch it needs some face when you asked him about temperament and playing well with others which he seemed to ...\nHe did though I I got that the new some look where he was like sort of not wanting to hear the question or\nIf we are in the studio and when we interviewed him a couple of weeks but you know he he held at\nAll right I thought and the you know we talked about housing we have a good I thought substantive yeah ocean on housing or you know I think John Cox was a little unhappy after right after the debate as we're walking out of the studio he was complaining that I had raised\nSome of the issues of his comments you know years ago about gay marriage and transvestite teachers those kinds of things but you know I I felt like I feel like you know voters have a right to know who these people are\nAnd how they're going to need some did ten Fifteen Years ago so I think it's all fake and I mean I think interestingly you also is on the aftermath of the debate\nSome very big differences between the candidates a nuisance came out held court in front of the media Cox basically refused to answer questions there some video some of our colleagues shot of him you know getting into the green renting the green room and then to the exit and\nYou know I Love it it's not and I think that it does speak to that sort of again differences in first of all experience you know in terms of what what these guys have done in the past and and then just also relationships with the reporters like I think\nCox tweeted out a couple of weeks ago at a photo of us with new someone he came in for a political breakdown and I'll say one more time John Cox we would\nLove to have you know I'm In you know but the bottom line is like a Democrat Republican you're in the press and you cover these guys for ten years you you do have a relationship but\nYou know there's another factor that we're all down in orange county a few weeks ago and covering the congressional races down there and maybe a a Kim Young rather a young kid to show them you're young young kid who's running for ed Royce will seek the Republican\nGave me time talk with her but the three incumbents down there than I did not and that you know I think there's just been over the years has become a much more adversarial relationship unfortunately between the media are much of the media and a Republican candidates\nAnd it's really about candidates because I don't think there's some Sacramento I think what other relationships with most of the Republicans up there and\nYou know anyway yeah I mean the young Kim benefited from talking to me I mean in terms of the coverage because at that point of view right you know in the story well I Want to turn next to a a debate that's not a debate that is having to Gemini between two Democrats one of which are come on our show Kevin de Leon state senator who is challenging longtime\nUS Senator Dianne Feinstein um he has been asking for debates she has demurred let's say I'm In this will be at the pie I see in San Francisco next week a conversation model\nI go and you know they've had excuses for that over the years you know she has run against some very weak\nAnd I think that this year that you have someone who ... regardless of the poll numbers is an established cigarette double candidate and you know so anyway it'll be an interesting conversation but I Know ... ... ... I'm sure I'm sure something all the answers um\nBut you know you wrote a story this week on our website about sort of a debate about debates and whether there should be sort of compulsory debates like if we should have a system like the presidential second I got\nTo thinking you know we've had presidential debates without debate really since Nineteen eighty eight and the reason is\nThat there is a presidential debate commission it was for other women can measure that well yet but they actually are ... they're they're all the time and they're you know they are they have credibility with both parties because it was started with the former chair of the currency and the DNC\nAnd every year since Nineteen eighty eight every presidential years there's been a debate and it's sort of thought I cast broadcast and everybody kinda buys into it and I just got to thinking why don't we have a version of that in California you know some kind of a\nBlue ribbon commission whose job it is it's bipartisan or nonpartisan whatever you want to call with credible folks that plans the debates because I think voters do benefit I mean I'm not sure how much of a difference debates make in the end in terms of influencing the outcome of an election\nBut you know you do have an opportunity voters due to see these two candidates the finalists or going head to head\nAnd just I I Would say to their apart or like one of the things about debates as sort of what I alluded to which is it's not just about the policy positions they take out it's about temperament and personality and how do you respond when you're being pressed on something or how do you share a stage with someone\nWho's your address here I think those things are telling in their ... and they are um and so that's that's my PSA for the day\nAnd let's take a short break we'll be joined joined by parents just got district or hang George ... when we got back\nYou're listening to political break down from ... public radio\n[noise]\nComing up on K cutie newsroom at nine thirty tonight a new report by the United nations to the world has a little more than a decade to slash carbon emissions to avoid the most severe

back to political breakdown I'm Scott Shafer along with Marie so law goes and we're here with San Francisco district attorney George gas going up good thank you thank you both of you screw it to see you guys\nAre going to you too and I think we there's a lot we want to cover it with you but I think we have to start with the news of the last few weeks so you're pretty shocking death and I think I Am too a lot of people not to seek re election so ... how how conversation in your head got like ... and on and how long it's going to yeah yeah\nSo now very long or you know uh it was really um [noise] the sushi and that was made over very short period of time really about two weeks total boiling to Sunday a couple of weeks ago saying okay this is what I have to do\nAnd we just say that your guests is about your mom who is ...\nThis is my mom rice so you know my dad both my mother and father will might now know passed a law lives in Southern California I have no civil ones was just me and the you know frankly\nAs you get further into your life you know you start losing your networks because you know the longevity has is too short rights do you have longevity and then you also [noise]\nAcross the border right there is no ethnic there is no ... in the rye rye Americans use drugs equal amounts or maybe sometimes even more when you're wealthy\nBut when you look at the people that were arresting writes there were all happened to be black and brown\nSo when you came you were recruited to come here from Arizona you bring the police chief in San Francisco Gavin Newsom a hired you I guess you could say well what was the culture ship what was that culture was a culture a welcome culture changed for you going from you know ... to San Francisco or with the kind of kind of a shock\nYou know it was a mix this new ones right first of all in in the it was one one of your\nUh colleagues pointed out to me several years ago the run or a TV shows is you know the understand that you and she does some research so she was so ... found that I don't know how this was writer but says you came from the most conservative politically conservative city in the country major city this nice was considered a major city over half a million people\nTo the most liberal and this and how do you reconcile the two\n... and what I told her and I believe that too is that you know the the basics of public safety or you know it's it's meeting a human need and then the city of civilized society that you need to have public quarter to question how you get there sometimes may vary a little but you know we all want to be safe in our homes we want to\nYou know feel comfortable with their families and all that stuff so flood in you know I met in and still have relationships with incredible people and and they said they were very supportive of my work and even when I got embroiled in the immigration fight which were incredible I mean I was probably one of the most stressful\nPeriods in my life I mean because there were even death threats are regularly and when you when I bought by a bio yeah you know and and sort of open up the scandal wars I mean I was getting\nHate mail from from Texas and other parts of the country was just insane ... most of the people in my community were very supportive and you know a lot of people realize what thirty percent population may soon as I was totally Latinos\nRan negative votes versus ...\nExactly right so ah but even even county government being mostly a Republican but you know there are a lot a lot of Mormons who you know a lot of people don't realize for instance the Mormon church is the largest growth of more insurance in the last two or three decades in Latin America\nWell yeah you fast forward a little bit more because they\nAren't insurance time so you become a police chief here you really I think it has it would be fair to say what the police officers association and some of the rank and file and and then\nNew than um get elected and kind of like Harris getting to be attorney general new names you district attorney which I think surprised a lot of people at the time for me [laughter]\nAnd then you became a champion and like really I Would say any of their prosecutor in California for a lot of the criminal justice reform sixteen prop forty seven which has still incredibly controversial you've championed bail reform but you know overseeing an office that prosecutors whose job it is to you know I come up like people I\nMean it's hard to reconcile those two things because they think it's very easy to say in theory I support that's criminal justice reform but you know I'm sitting in front of a victim and I want there to be justice for the ...\nRight right actually no I mean I I think it's actually it's actually very cool and grow and thrive a smart public safety requires that that you think about not only the impact on the moment but also you're thinking about the impact on the community overall that you're thinking of all the impact on social ...\nFact on the community overall you're thinking of all the impact on social fabric of your community the economic impact that you will have in our community and it here's what I tell people I think this is the best way for me to to illustrate my point we have a criminal justice system has failed and here's how I'd say look\nAbout Seventy percent of the people that we touch and go back and refund right\nIf you walk into a counter over the airport in front of you know to outline clerk and you tell in the court tells you you know you have a Seventy percent chance that this plane's gonna fall would you would you buy a ticket on the plane and the answer is obviously not\nBut when it comes to the criminal justice system we have continued to buy the ticket over and over again at the expense of building schools and you know we build more jails more prisons and at some point we have to realize that it's not making us any safer\n[noise] one of the most difficult things I Would imagine that a da such a progressive da like here south has to deal with is when\nYou know that tension between communities of color and police departments in particular when there's a shooting you know using an ... an ongoing issue in San Francisco and in particular said the Mario woods shooting or any of you and you have to decide whether or not whether or not you're going to prosecute a police officer to talk about that\nTension that goes on in a ... you know within your office between the pd and the da\nAnd and there's it's painful for me on many levels because you know I you know first of all I Am not somebody that would that came into the law as a prosecutor is a lawyer I Walk the streets was off LA for years I you know I went through the ranks\nSo I Will get policing I Know about policing I Know one police makes ... legitimate mistakes I Know when they don't uh many times and you know I Know there were many times where I could use the force that I didn't write because I felt that I didn't have to write and the problem\nWith the a lot of the police training and the law is that the law has become so permissive around police use of force\nThat it's a very unreasonable level of fear within the officers a moment because it's really a split second moment that can lead to use them for some really tragic consequences and you can look at her and said this may be a lawful shooting under current law\nBut was unnecessary was it was this a minimum a minimum amount of force necessary and this is really where the conflict comes in right because\nSome people say well you know if it wasn't necessary they should act on it and I said look I mean that's that's policy decisions you for police can fire people for that right I'm looking at a through the legal lanes and only through illegal once and while I may stand up I did then that gives them more it wasn't so I think this will not necessary shooting or order one for going Gore a\nI have to say at the same time this under current law this are lawful shootings\nAnd in order to change the law\nSo lonely I was the only the only law enforcement personally the only the aid that actually supported the the nine thirty one\nWhich brings me and the question I Want to ask but just like what's it like being in that meeting with all this other TAs and you know one person like that and sort of more probably I mean as someone who is ... politically like what do you think that public needs to know about prosecutors and the power they kinda wheeled around these multi conversation well\nLet me look I mean first of all\nAnd I think that people have finally come to realize that and that's why you see it's moving around the nation as well do you know how to shift to the dialogue around prosecutors prosecutors especially prosecutors in major cities in this country\nUm control a mass incarceration I mean it's through the loss of supportive but really at the end of the day it is a prosecutor to makes the ultimate decision you know I'm going to intervene with a case to what level and and that's becoming crystal clear now too many people I think that\nI'm also I have to say that you know way large you know most prosecutors are ethical people that want to do the right things that they do the things that they believe in you know my generation of people in public safety grew up in the area of locking people up right\nAnd and that was you know we became hammers and when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail\nAnd I think it's hard for people for human beings I mean I don't care if you're a doctor or lawyer whatever is very hard to start diverting in a different direction when you you believe in what you're doing on the way you're doing this a lot of those conversations or\nMaybe tennis but I I don't think people are coming from from a rural place on this also I think the electoral process\nSpeaks to this stuff right nice even in San Francisco not right there are people talking about well we need to start looking up some of the homeless and then companies and saying well we're first of all I don't know that we have the tools to do that so even if even if we wanted to um you know people don't realize that the the the tools or not there for that but then you have to think more\nMore basically we want to do we want us there sending mentally ill people and and people that are poor that you know to jail or prison is that is that the society that we want to be is that the solution to the problem\nYeah and I mean we've seen a lot like where he is also resign and then sort of in the next ... sat there while they re\nTournaments I have just like to ... seconds left what do you think the city needs in an ex da and you're going to make an endorsement at some\nPoint yeah I I don't think I Would make an endorsement I think it will be important for the for the process to you know to be open I think that what we need somebody that is going to come in and and obviously do their own thing and put their own stamp but\nBut there are things that we've done a there's a lot of progress whereas it used to date or the you know the the reform process that we have a we the interventions that we do the use of resources justice will juveniles on stuff that I Hope that they will continue to make up better\nI think it's so much for coming in to act out they had a much pleasure to both of you thank you that's ... that's a definite political breakdown fraction of cake unity public radio\nAnd you can check out all of our elections coverage we're calling it our voter guide it's at ... dot org slash elections and we also have a newsletter you can subscribe to that at ... dot org slash political breakdown\nPretty

officer I'm Scott Shafer you can follow me on Twitter is ... and ... and law goes to that is a rapper this week political break down from cake UT we'll see you next week but I [noise]\nComing up next ... newsroom\nAnd the public policy Institute of California did this study it sound like California is very vulnerable and or under the couch or we could miss one and a half million people we could lose a seat in Congress in the house we could lose out on billions of dollars in federal funding what are some of the some\nSuggestions or this week some reporting that suggests that in the Trump Administration there were actual conversations about putting a citizenship question into the census perhaps for the uh uh uh effort\nA ban on an issue that the national debate and the Steve Miller when within the White House but important issue to them it seems kind of like a new thing but they they thought that it would help and fish will reinforce\nThat's right and what happens when you put a citizenship question is is a lot of uh undocumented immigrants don't want to answer the door and a lot of them and I will not be counted that's right and if you're if you're not counted in California perhaps could lose they suggest I'm\nA ... a congressional seat and a lot of services all in all the funding or there's a lot at stake with this question and that's why a California's fighting it internally general's fighting\nWell let's say the Democrats win control of the house in November how would that affect their ability to perhaps make sure this question about citizenship stays off the senses I I got to think that that would be in St below sees a ... and let's face it I think she'd be speaker if that happens\nOr the Democrats here in California have made it absolutely clear ah this is a priority for them to get that question for\nSure what the Democrats are really real to do is bring a trove of it attrition officials and for view because they're not going to get much\nAll right Carla ...\nSlashed forty five percent by twenty thirty meeting this call would require a global commitment to phase out coffee electricity production and replace it with renewable energy\nJamie now to talk about the findings is mostly energy professor and Daniel Kammen Dan nice to have you back with us thanks for having me on we'll talk about the language pointing at the moment but first I wanted to ask you about the awful destruction caused by hurricane Michael on the east coast\nHow much of climate change contributed to his ferocity\nWell we don't know for hurricane Michael yet because it's still unleashing it's damage but the first scientific papers are already in on Hurricane Florence just a few weeks ago in the Carolinas and that storm was fifty percent warmer fifty percent more damaging because of climate change and because of the extra heat in the ocean\nThat we're seeing so fifty percent is caused a great deal of those surges the damages I we can expect similar results from Michael\nWell let's talk about the un report as well because it's kind of connected on this very comprehensive this new report involving now they're wanting scientists all over the world who analyzed one in six thousand and scientific studies in fact they looked at the same things that you have died what is your take on their findings\nPulls anything I Would say they've been conservative and they've been conservative because they need to be the PCC which share the two thousands of a Nobel Peace prize they only work from publish papers so some of the papers that came out of my group and many others were utilizes input\nBut that's been published a couple of years ago to make it in and with the rapid impacts of climate change happening day by day\nSome of the most recent results or even more scary than the ones that few years ago so they've been conservative by design but even so\nThey pay into very bleak picture the chances of wildfires of sustained droughts are huge impacts on food production and heat waves and cities\nGo up dramatically for every degree and so this idea that we need to not only hit this to to target but aim for one and a half\nWould avoid billions if not trillions of dollars of damage\nAnd leaves you're talking about on how to do with like climate scientists have focused on which at the prediction that if the atmosphere warms up I'd like to point technically satellite or one point five degrees Celsius or Ted experiencing the devastating effect and you just mentioned how close are we to hit that mark\nSo sadly we're very close we've already warmed by about one point five degrees Fahrenheit so we have very little head room left\nVery little space to admit more pollutants and witnessed report really highlights is how much easier will make our job if we can keep it under this one point five degrees Celsius target not going to to two degrees Celsius so that three point seven Fahrenheit down to down to under three\nAnd it's a really important things on a number of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including reducing dependence on coal to generate electricity and and they want you to see it go from around forty percent about seven percent or less my twin two fifty\nSo lipstick though is that given that President Trump has vowed to increase the burning of coal given that it's also very cheap to produce and countries like China and India\nWell actually so coal is no longer the cheapest option and this is something that heads of state heads of energy companies are really just coming to grips with the fact two days ago they had the world bank at a major announcement\nAt a conference in Bali announced that the world bank would no longer fund coal at all\nBecause renewables were cheaper now I Would have liked to bank to go further because I used to work there to say that we're going to get rid of coal for other reasons social and local environmental but justice cost differences already meant that coal plants that are being planned by China in other countries such as in Kenya\nCoal plants that were scheduled for Kosovo and the Balkans coal plants that were scheduled for Pakistan they will all no longer receive World Bank funding\nWhich makes it much harder to launch them and this is really designed to be the first wave of efforts to get coal out entirely that seven percent was an upper limit two percent is the goal that we want to see it hit by twenty fifty and we're really looking at zero coal\nCarbon taxes California already has a ... program but this is a global problem so how many other places I've been asked a similar program so how much farther and do we need to go\nWhere we need to go a lot further but the good news is that California's carbon program its cap and trade program is going strong and the big new entrant is China and China this year is launching its carbon price after\nSeveral years of experimenting city by city city I promise by province and we find their effective but as you say the only effective if we spread them and they really become part of the global economy\nSo how is it working in China that how much are they charging well\nChina is just entering it right now by the end of this year they will have launched a larger version their carbon price wouldn't be higher than the California price California right now it's twelve dollars a ton\nChina's aiming more like twenty or more dollars a ton and under President Obama the U.S eat PA had said the social cost of carbon should be more like thirty to forty dollars of time\nBut does that go far enough because the un report says heavy\nTaxes on carbon dioxide emissions would be needed to help avoid catastrophes suggesting as maybe as high as twenty seven thousand dollars right part time is that politically feasible\nCertainly twenty seven thousand dollars is not feasible what the BCC was highlighting is that if you're only tool is a carbon price it might need to realistically be not fifty or a hundred dollars a ton but several hundred even up to a couple of thousand\nBut places like California and Europe have a number of other mechanisms in California we have requirements for clean electricity clean vehicles clean housing and those are equivalent show carbon price but we don't express it that way and so at the PCC things if you want to take away all these other rules\nSo with the PC suits things we'd want to take away all these other rules you would need a price that high so what they're actually saying is the other way around what they're saying is\nA mixture of a reasonable carbon price carbon price that we give something back to poor people plus all of the sexual targets that's a strategy that would get us on pace to meet this one point five retired\nAnd and the plant you just mentioned it kind of gets to what some conservatives are proposing which is this idea that you tax carbon emissions and then you get from it that money from those factors back to the American public ... Cleo quarterly checks is that a good idea\nSo I think this is a great idea and actually I'm a former secretary of state James Baker on the Republican side has been a key author of this and the idea is exactly that that you give back part of the taxes particularly to lower income Americans but to all Americans got some back\nAnd that that really pushes a tax on pollution across the economy and we use some of the money to invest in clean energy\nBut in exchange and some conservatives want the Obama era environmental regulations to be ... per person bait and switch perhaps\nSo the politics is exactly a bait and switch\nIf the Republican plan was such as this tax make revenue neutral by for example letting other taxes get reduce for example a capital gains tax for employment taxes\nBut keeping environmental regulation then we have a strategy more like California where we have strong environmental regulations that protect us and we start to wreck crank up this tax\nBecause we know ultimately we need to be\nSubsidizing clean energy and penalizing dirty energy and so the Republican politics are not as good as just the elements of the plant itself\nDan Kammen when he's in Berkeley always a pleasure to have you on and given this great explainer Oh thanks for having me\nWe turn now to San Francisco's homeless crisis on Tuesday sales force and the c._e._o. mark many off announced they would donate about two million dollars to support a controversial ballot measure to help the homeless\nProposition C with tax big businesses in the city to raise as much as three hundred million dollars for homeless programs including housing shelter beds and mental health services\nSan Francisco mayor Lyndon weight is opposing the measure say it doesn't contain any accountability for how that money is spent joining me now with more on this debate are\nGay community politics and government reporter guy Marcia ... and Molly Turner and urban innovation lecture at\nAnd the November midterms approach critical election central coverage NPR name\n\n...
