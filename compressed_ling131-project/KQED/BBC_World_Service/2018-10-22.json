R. E. W. S. yes bruises\nI I and I'm very I'm California way opposite for some wine but I did not have any beer at all wow that's\nAnya Scott time but yeah we had a couple of hundred folks out to talk about the ballot ask us questions say a little quiz game are going to do to more of these one of SF one down in San jose\nI think the San Francisco and I sold out but if you go to kick you eat out or you could probably get on the weekend the waiver interested or do you give us we've actually do you want us to do more of these events apparently people know who we are are they doing it I'm ... after you were drinking wine or you know I didn't know that oh really [laughter]\nIt was really impressive you know middle of the week or you got three hundred people come down to talk about the voter and what's on the ballot\nAnd so I knew about like the dialysis ballot measure and things that I mean I think we're still kind of building up on an ambulance\nBorder breaks EMT workers all those things but it was it was you know it is a democracy in action and it was great to see so many people out a ... we never even talked about that\nOne no people are really focused on a statewide stuff which I thought with ... and how I Am in Russia but let's talk about another race statewide Senate\nYes so finally we had a a debate on that or not just rank a Dianne Feinstein and Kevin deli over at a public policy Institute California and they were seated in between there in between them was mark Bolger sorry a pollster CEO you were there what was the what was the room like what was the fuel food there\nYeah so it was a really tiny room there was overflow outside and I would say it was like this who's who of politicos in San Francisco like clearly when the when the memo went out that that's what's happening\nEvery like strategist and sort of you know consulted ... immediately looks their ticket little can remember the public there were there were like no chance would you\nKnow I mean I don't I I you know and I want to like start PBS you under the bus here but it definitely was there was a lot of familiar faces you know folks that obviously work for both of these candidates but then people who are just sort of peripherally involved I mean Dan Newman\nGavin Newsom consultant was there I was like what Daniels in for another job also a friend of ours do well yeah at public rallies turn around so\nUm but I mean I think it was interesting you know I Would say like my sort of read on it is that I don't think it really changes is race much\nUm I Know not everyone agrees with me here I Am\nKevin de Leon ... well I think that that for the format he couldn't have come out swinging in a way that I think he has been on the campaign trail um I think he would have kind of looked like a bully it was this very sort of civil polite conversation\nBut I I think if you are maybe more progressive and listen to what he's saying you might decide to vote for him and I think Feinstein um you know was everything we know her to be sort of elder statesman very one I'm I'm you know I like I there was no big surprises from\nYeah like the headline nobody made a big mistake a thought he was most Kevin Milligan was most impassioned around\nA bit more of the war and also the wall and why feeling like Democrats aren't as impassioned about the wall or oh about immigration and dreamers those right Republicans are about building the damn walls you know so I think that\nYou always scores appoint sort of thing but like you said it was a very once they stayed event but it was a he will not get ... for sure\nYeah and I think that like it was interesting because some of the ... and and if you want to\nSay pensions he landed we're a little subtle like I think he talked about in sort of general terms you know his background and sort of current life status on and and sort of tried to contrast that with Diane Feinstein the wealth of course she's married to a very wealthy man I'm and you know I think but I agree I think the Iraq War stuff went well you know I think it\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it Hooper micro dot com\nOr any matter um and really like it seems like in so many ways it's about style differences with those two um even though we know that they are big policy different yeah he's a moderate Democrat\nYeah you know it's interesting to me too is ah they both came out against one of Jerry Brown's big project the delta tunnel they were both against that are out there in ... ah and then do you own set also he was very concerned about high speed rail a day in fact it was asked about that she didn't get to that part she was talking about the tunnels but\nUh you know I'm not sure that it matters so much for Jerry Brown but the polls tell us God I don't know well I I haven't seen any like delta tunnel toll oh no I'm Out on the race on the race oh the race a well in fact there was in LA Times pull out a two day\nAnd it shows you know ... or Kevin ... got some work to do shall we say that thirty one percent\nOr Dianne Feinstein forty four percent so certainly hurts to lose a she's in a commanding position\nAnd ironically are the biggest source of support for Kevin do you own the progressive running to the left of Dianne Feinstein Republican voters\nThat doesn't surprise me at all I mean I see that as a protest but he's still not super well known around the state he you know Dianne Feinstein is probably the most well known politician other than Jerry Brown in California and you know despite the fact that she has a very moderate on issues that mattered Republicans including war and water\nAnd she they don't like her I mean she's been around\nForever and so I think that you know it it it isn't a shock I think that he's probably getting some folks on the left as well but you know who knows it it seems like that's a soft number two jobs whether they'll actually vote for him or anybody I mean they may take a pass on that right well I think that's the bigger question is how many people just sit out that question on the\n... like well we have a lot more whole talk and we're going to get through in just a minute we're going to bring a pollster Ben ... into the show and first we're going to take a very short break you're listening to political breakdown on ...\n[noise]\nComing up to nine thirty ... newsroom you can hear a discussion with state senator Kevin de Leon who is trying to unseat US Senator Dianne Feinstein\nAnd then former chief official White House photographer under President Obama Pete Souza talks about his new book shade a tale of two presidents cake you eat the newsroom that's coming up tonight at nine thirty\nThe forecast for tonight in the bay area calls for cloudy skies excuse me increasing clouds overnight lows in the upper forties and fifties Tamara cloudy through the morning then graduate clearing highs in the sixties and seventies right now there's just so the temperature is fifty five degrees [noise]\n\nWelcome back to political breakdown ... legacy Scott Shafer and we are super excited to welcome Benton pollster extraordinary welcoming coming in thanks\nFor having me on I think as a service to our listeners and frightening and we got to ask who are you working for this political season a lot of candidates but my main focus this cycle is a congressional race a battle for Congress I mean it's imperative\nAs a democratic pollster for Democrats went back the house that's the best opportunity we have some working in every single competitive congressional race in California where the candidate ... mix of a candidates directly or independent spenders committees are working on behalf of the candidates so let's like\nBreaking it down a little bit for audience like assuming they don't know as much as we do about polls God Bless them they shut down\nBeen able to play been more effective than he was very popular millennials\nAre and who weren't enthused with Hillary so those those three groups Bernie would have done better with a and he would have won the election but I you know unfortunately you didn't win the nomination and couldn't find that out\n[laughter] ah well there's always twenty twenty\nAnd I think so okay so is it as a member of the media like we only required generally on the public polls that he sees the field poll national you know there's survey usa feel free to jump in and bash any of your competitors at any point\nBut I have found and and and the reason we don't report on internal polls is one we don't always get them into there's this sense that I can see bias or whatever but\nIt seems like the internal polls can be more accurate than the public polling do you think that's fair and\nAlso like ... like why would that be I guess is it just a funding issue\nI yeah I think internal polling done ride is typically more accurate because\nThe amount of the volume right we do a lot more pulling the public polling P. P. I. C. to great institution they provide a great service during public polling but they do quarterly\nPolling Iran and they don't release it for several weeks I mean I'm pulling every night right with Bernie we were doing\nYou know hundreds of interviews every night and so that's why I could course correct I mean it's basically an editor of process like the millennial peace we figured that out there in it or a process of doing hundreds hundreds every night so I could volume and the other thing is in this business because I'm In a for profit consulting business as as my industry\nUm you don't if you have a reputation of being an accurate you're not going to stay in business very long\nSo we're the aggregate polls we feel like on five thirty in New York Times like that all junk well the polls\nIs of the problem with aggregating polling data is if you have crappy polls in your pool ... sausage making right you get some rats in there the sauce you like some people sick right so that's the problem with the aggregating and um I I just ... those of us were posters do this for a living\nA reputation is depending on how accurate we are\nWe've heard there's a lot of polls out now we talked about the only times poll PBS people coming out next week there was there's been other PBS people's [noise]\nYou know and and we seem like very different numbers on say proposition six which is to repair the gas tax and uh the one poll that showed I think it was Berkeley I. G. S. poll showed it losing the repeal losing so the no side was winning\nA and they read the actual ballot language a as opposed to describing what it was and and so I'm just wondering what what are your thoughts\nAbout how humans like surveys they had a winning two to one but they just said do you want to repeal the gas out\nSo well that I was going to you this I mean like language\nMatters right and this is about labels are critical I mean I've done a fair amount of ballot issues my career and we spend a lot of time and effort\nPolling every word because every word matters if you have Seventy five words a voter can read every word matters and so uh and the reality is that a ... there's no magic formula right that's why there's not one polling firm that's figure it out and and monopolize the industry or their different approaches we all take but\nUm but no I think the child is public polling is ... they're not held accountable right I mean they can be way off they'll still get hired again whereas if you know ... a consulting if we're way off that can hurt your reputation\nSo let's talk about you know we have an eight minutes left let's talk about this November\nWhat's going to happen now I'm like well how do you think things look for Democrats we talked at the top of that that blue wave in the sense that the house look fairly good for them\nThe Senate may not um the cabin I hearing that turn that around I think Republicans are talking about being energized like what's your read broadly and then maybe we can talk about some of the races you're working\nYeah look I think um you know nationally right Trump dominates her politics like nothing we've ever seen so this is going to be such a referendum on Trump for the most part what she's bracing I mean as ... you\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it Hooper micro dot com\nAnd the house and I should say I've been a bull on dams winning uh uh the house back for a long time I've been very optimistic folks in Washington right now I don't know I don't want to go ahead of ourselves because they've been burned so many times as I said look on my points looking really good because you have a lot of suburban districts in orange County California or in suburban does it around the country twenty three that Hillary won\nA middle class or the magic formula for Democrats with Trump as\nMiddle class or upper middle class suburban and diverse if you have a combination of those three all three of those three college educated women you exactly college into the middle class if you have college educated women Republican women who are turned off by Trump\nOr ... doing very well most districts and there are you know and not even districts that Hillary won but even ... got under fifty percent\nI'm pulling in a suburban Atlanta Georgia race where things look very good right for us it's a diverse it's young if it's educate well educated\nSo I think they're you know do what is our chance of winning forty to fifty seats and if all goes really well you're looking at fifty to sixty but um but that's a big wave right and and you know that's where the next two weeks play out but these these elections wave elections tend to break most of the close races twenty ten twenty fourteen thousand six break\nDoes away against the party in power for the party\nSenator so ... what would be your guess about how many seats Democrats pick up in California\nI probably I think we can win I mean you've got nine and play um essentially I think when\nHave good chance of winning seven maybe eight or nine\nMinute how do you think that that can hunter I see it like\nWell for full disclosure I'm working for a Democrat Mark ... that are but we\nThen you know so\nWe release deposed public worry him are after the indictment it's dead even race and and uh hunters negatives were sky high and and the diamond is is absolutely devastating and if you look at the reason fundraising numbers or you know hundreds not raising any money spending all legal bills so you know a ... a very good position to win that race and find the rabbit around\nA ... and going on trips to Italy lots of fun\nAnd one of the tricks were polling is you've got to figure out who the likely voters are right who are going to go to the polls are not mail in their ballots ah how do you judge that\nI this is where you were in the Arab big data this works human judgment and the role of pollsters very important I think one critique that came out in the ... book shattered about the twenty sixth for Hillary Clinton campaign was they relied on big data analytics and they just had a model they stuck with it and then they realize the models wrong after they lost\nA and I what I've found in swat they always have a job in politics if I Want to stay as a\nPollster is there's a human a\nPerspective that you have to inject things change politics is a very volatile industry and business and giving sample twenty fourteen I'm at the national Democrats hired me and none of the pollsters and at the end they said bend you're the most accurate pollster 'cause he's the only one who anticipated bad year for us and what happened was I just don't mid September\nI was like I don't feel good about this election we don't have a message on our messages are basis not enthused I I don't think it's going to turn out well and I made that judgment in mid September so I changed course\nOr like you know that's like that one guy his like have predicted every president has been the other one he's he's going to be the replacement for that\nI'm not no I mean one of the things we here and we talk about a lot is like how much turnout matters for damages right that it's not and not just to go after Republican voters are and the party preference\nUm I mean what's your sense on whether we're going to see the millennials really come out that time and we every year talking about Latino finally exercising their power I mean do you think those groups are energized this year\nYeah I mean look you look at the primary turnout was pretty good right we had decent turnout overall as well as the partisan makeup and Latinos and millennial showing up and typically primaries are good precursor for general election so I'm very optimistic about our chances in November\nTurnout is there any pressure on a pollster too I mean who no one wants to deliver bad news to the candidate in particular a is there pressure to you know how to deliver that knew you were close we're close I\nLet me just say there's an art and science to what I Do right so uh uh I you know I Can't uh all my trade secrets but um there are moments when you have to play counselor as well as poster with candidates 'em up but you have to do in a way that's responsible an accurate and\nI'm ... and realistic but um but yeah no there's an art\nAnd science ... hooked up is it to you know a for a candidate when they know they're going to lose like a month out to just keep going up as though\nIt's tough it's tough but typically campaigns that hire me as a husband who our pollster tend to be competitive through the end the long shots um well honestly they'll do appalled that this was a long shot doesn't materialize then you don't hear from the candidate very much\n[laughter] well we're going to get the actual poll on election day I think we have more than what it will have to let you go\nFor now that I think he's the match thank you and I don't see that as a nation of political breakdown of production of cake unity public radio and you can\nCheck out all of our elections coverage we're calling at our voter guide and it's at ... dot org slash elections we also have a newsletter by the way you can subscribe to that at ... dot org slash political breakdown\nAnd next week we'll have Dianne Feinstein the one and only on the right down to please ... for tonight our producers are already in our engineer and sail Mahler piece\nAnd Lindsey is our executive editor and highly current events are cheap contest officer I'm Scott Shafer you can follow me at at Scott Shafer\nThan ... you can find me on Twitter ... and why does that is a rat for the political breakdown come back next time next time with Diane Feinstein [laughter]\n\nAnd then next time will be this Thursday or next Thursday\nAnd the next time will be this Thursday or next Thursday coming up after six thirty PM support for ... D comes from ... L L P\nWill actually to the future nearly wins and maybe even a further a prosecutor and the courts a worst case scenario he loses and he's prosecuted records I think he's fighting for his political life\nAnd another a contentious race or Sean Devin Nunes is the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee and we saw him in the headlines a lot with the Russia investigation um he is now at war with his own hometown newspaper the Fresno Bee attacking for renting harsh editorials for running investigative articles on his business interests\nIf they take an page out of President Trump's paper\nI just think that the entire election cycle here is about as ugly as we've seen in a couple of generations so let's take a step back\nThe entire California path way forward for Nancy Pelosi to take the speakership again a lot of it does run through California the Democrats were feeling very very good about three or four weeks ago everything has narrowed from from Kavanaugh to Elizabeth Warren to Hillary Clinton kind of floating it problems she's going to run again\nA ... to pay to the ... and the Democrats have now turned it on their ten at\nFundraising advantages and all these racist so I think\nThat Republicans are very depressed three weeks ago\nNow they're in a fight for their lives and the person who makes the mistake laugh is probably the person who's going to lose but Mimi Walters is much better shape today even data Rebecca is looking better I Will call it out here Duncan Hunter even though he's indicted is probably going to win or some other races that are in more trouble but republic or look at a lot better today and they did three weeks ago\nYeah the fundraising advantage for the Democrats has been amazing but Sean his right Democrats have made some strategic mistakes\nSponsorship of the cake you really live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it Hooper micro dot com\nSo is that we found the right to point out a lot going on a lot to watch I Want to thank you all for being with us John Walsh Carla ... and John Meyers the Sacramento nice that they give it to you\nAnd now I look at that Senate race this week California's candidates for senator sat down for their own public face to face conversation and this campaign season and then Senator Dianne Feinstein challenges facing the cat in the ... it's a different set of foreign policy by the policy of California in fact in fact go\nFind find that's represented California Nineteen Ninety to\nTheir young says it's time for a new way of thinking and Washington shares for twelve years in the state legislature and widespread protest and let them stay fat because his top priorities in Washington when the immigration reform and single payer health care\nAs part of our election coverage taking any politics senior editor Scott Shafer sat down with Kevin Dario earlier\nTheir daily on welcome thank you you were running against the twenty six year incumbent and Dianne Feinstein and I'm Wondering are you saying essentially to voters that she has been ineffective as as a senator\nLucy Scott that I think these are very dangerous consequential times in our nation's history\nAnd we're engaged in a battle for America's soul against the president without one [noise] um I Would say that the status quo in Washington is either unwilling or incapable of fighting back so I think strongly that time that we stop\nBiting our time biting our tongue while this president unraveled California's progress um when you say you're not afraid to fight back like what do you mean by that well I think that on the issue of climate change on the issue of ice agents who had been\nPursuing mothers and fathers between American children are on the issue of health care and Medicare for all these values or not and being represented in Washington DC today and that's why I Want to be a new voice I think it's time for a new approach in a new change today in California\nSo Senator Feinstein has known as a\nCentrist center left senator or somebody who reaches across the aisle where would you put yourself on the political spectrum to me it's it's not so much about being more to the left or be more to the right but it's about actually moving forward with policies that are common sense a policy that I've accomplish here in California one hundred percent clean energy\nCenturies status equal pay for women to an equal work or not just those are the weight loss I don't think they're liberal policies per se\nTo meet these are policies and improve the human condition for all individuals to me does make a difference voted for Trump for Bernie Sanders for Hillary Clinton elevating the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour a while the inaction of Washington to seven dollars and twenty five cents than improved a ... a a life of all families in California so what makes you say\n'cause you're telling them voters look don't hire her again hire me you know so why why would you be better at being US Senator representing California than she is\nBecause it's time to have someone who's going to fight for the values that we care deeply about on the issue of health care because I strongly believe that it's a universal rights for the wealthy than in fact I Believe in Medicare for all not Medicare for some\nOn the issue with regard to climate change which is an existential threat to our humanity and to our planet let's put\nThis country on a track to unnatural set clean energy like I did here in California\nSenator Feinstein has a lot of seniority and our other senator Kamala Harris does not or if you were to win we'd have two senators you know freshmen senators why would the stay want to throw out all that send you already and all that experience because that's how the Senate works right as\nSeniority but Scott let me say this that seniority\nIf you don't use that seniority\nBut we witness with CONMEBOL Harris as well as Cory Booker and other senators during the hearings of the cabinet or before the Judiciary Committee you saw them\nBe assertive and make motions for Germans um we didn't see that from the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee so seniority means that the whether people agree or disagree with Elizabeth Warren um I Will give her credit and that she elevates the positions that she cares deeply about two national level\nOne of the things that Senator Feinstein has been criticized for is holding onto the letter that Brett Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford gave her that she hung on to it too long what would you have done if you'd been unfettered effect let her go onto you\nClearly I Would have made sure that her confidentiality\nHer privacy protected\nThe unfortunate part about the Judiciary Committee is they have no process the process he's that exist to deal with the confidentiality of a citizen who comes before the Judiciary Committee to say hey I was sexually assaulted by this individual but I fear for my life\nI Would have made sure that we could protect her a ... and then me the uh her confidentiality our privacy\nAnd then I Would engage my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee say we have this before us and turn this over to the FBI it was the leadership of the other members of the Judiciary Committee other Democrats who insisted an import\nCenter finds time to turn to document over to the FBI\nSo there are currently just twenty three women in the U.S Senate Dianne Feinstein is one of them or is it really a good time to remove one of those senators from the Senate and replace it with another\nMan well I can tell you that says that I've always been a strong supporter of women in politics and being in positions of power to impact the human condition for all California for all Americans [noise] um I've been inspired in motivated by someone like my mother\nAnd by women janitors in home care workers and nurses who have overwhelmingly endorsed my candidacy ultimately this specific race is not about gender\nThe specifically is about values and the ...\nCivic rates is not about gender specific questions about values and the values that we want represented in Washington DC my campaign manager all of my senior staff all women in ... in my campaign for the U.S Senate so ultimately it's not about gender and having the right values represented in California in Washington\nYou have champion immigrant rights are both legal and undocumented immigrants you authored as the fifty four which is now known as sanctuary state law and many people Republicans in particular are criticizing pointing to outlaw\nAnd local sanctuary laws as well as a a battering rams to a beat up Democrats that they're running against does it concern you at all but that issue is being used against a your fellow Democrat\nOr this is an issue that's personal to me obviously coming from an immigrant family but also maybe this is about authenticity and he's about the values that you adhere to that political short term gain\nAnd this is another example of a huge contrast between me and the senior senator back in twenty Fifteen the senior senator floated seriously the idea in the U.S Senate outlined establishment up century cities\nHad that bill passed\nBack in twenty Fifteen or when Donald Trump started attacking and undermining our laws in California and going after hardworking immigrants I Will not have been able to pass this actually stay bill in California\nSome Democrats are calling to about for the uh abolish minute vice is that something\nYou already with that let me say this on the issue of a boss when advice because I think some folks are taking a very personal\nUm ice lost its way\nInstead of focusing on terrorism on drug traffickers on human traffickers as well as weapons traffickers a violent criminal felons their focus on mothers and the mission district or and he said oh say or fruit bell in Oakland selling demolished\nOr fruit instead of dealing with the real issue which is normalizing the legal status of millions of hardworking Americans throughout the country they have weaponized as police agency to terrorize young children and their mothers\nAnd if you're a successful in November if you're elected to go back to Washington what's the first thing you'd like to get done ...\nI think that for health care for all I Believe in Medicare for all not Medicare for some of the central threat of climate change I Want to put this nation on a track to one hundred percent clean energy by introducing a national clean energy plan and immigration reform\nNot to be an ... science in Austin the ten o'clock hour a foreign
