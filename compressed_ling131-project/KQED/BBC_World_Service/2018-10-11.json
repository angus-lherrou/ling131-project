you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for the entertainment value but my big piece at that moment when he brought her onstage wearing that was not her ... down knowing what she can hold that she wasn't going to eat that nah that no one would care that ... find her interest gang\nWouldn't care that no one would find her interesting or attractive and she just went out and she killed it and they loved it in for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to her sad about for a lay\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know\nI Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or for people and you often hear you know a debate dinner or project slower or beat this or that are younger\nAnd at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that ... that we can personalize it whether it's in an interview or what have you and I think that was a part of it\nHas her what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name's me to take me as I Am and she worked at it you know got them to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and\nI thought it it kind of the ill\nYeah Heather I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's an alley billboard and he says we should have just made old billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever uh existence and thrive\nIn Hollywood as far as coming up the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry as the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing is placed in time where this movie a space and time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how\nThings are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less power than they used to so it's almost like we own fashion and its view of the music industry\nBut only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also trying to end but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars more just kind of want to be in on the conversation she\nTells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go when the homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her heart\nI also thought about pink\nWho's very much an invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical filed style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways\nIs very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply offend or D sand as opposed to there's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path so agree with Anna about that but I think\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie is she is way more important than ... than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper just had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd in that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocket and guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spent a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga character Ali used just improvising the love saw\nSponsorship of ... the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the patron or for your theater at the gym and a half dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano in saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's ... recently saying everything live in the movie wow you there's nothing we're not lips thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene in the actors fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself so she really gave me the confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he was a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar to Kevin Kevin ...\nAnd I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism\nAnd stayed with him it'd be more interesting he's he's increasingly mean he has petty\nThey don't respond to that knee jerk fashion

movie club which in power is Linda Holmes and John horn let's get to a few more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis he Jean what did you think of a star is born\nHere gene can you hear me yes I gave it five stars which why five stars\n[noise] um actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing thing and one one thing I think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her age ah the guy who made her over\nThe manager do agent played yeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him\nAnd I I guess I wasn't supposed to but ah the minute he had that conversation\nWith jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start as of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I think I heard you chime in as well\nNow that was male dominated go ahead yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health in recovery portions of this story one of the tricks with the manager is I think\nThey do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they make her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them from the beginning\nUm but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced elements\nThat it doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed debt because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate in a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really deal with the job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on to say to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps for getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending but\nThey'll go ahead and go well of course\nOf course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster as like the guy got what's called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all of the virtues of the SARS ... have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I\nAbsolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions\nHere muscles are sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know we're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the stars foreign versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of part of the cast\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the patron or for him theater at ... dot com\nIt's to a man's fall [laughter]\nAnd that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA toward that lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say that even as Jackson, Maine is saves temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from\nHis young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery\nFeminist raining problematic found well\nBut you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a failing male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative ... guys nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better develops possibly a moment perhaps the moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I loved the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ...

worth pointing out that even if we removed old pollution sources from the environment so we took humans out of the equation there would be a very very small amount remaining so for example natural

topic and environment around space mining but in the development of outer space in general\nWe now have rockets that we can reuse we've been to all the planets and the solar system we're finding moons and other solar systems we've landed on comments brought back samples from asteroids rode around on their services\nAnd I think the big shift is we are passing a tipping point where there is more private money\nBeing invested in space exploration and development than public money the public money certainly paved the way as it as it almost always does and with those points of inside the exploration back from the the first first explorer so to speak\nOr we can see the advantages see the opportunities and really start the industrialization of space and expanding human society to to new places\nWhat are you going to mind for MySpace money standpoint we are today focused on those resources that you can use in space so that you don't have to bring them with you\nAnd as in all things and transportation you don't want heavy baggage you don't want to be paying for shipping very expensive heavy things or you want to bring a little with you as possible and get all those things onsite\nAge do a who's who may one right water or ice in the form of with what you find on asteroids that was the first talk it used to be about you know water\nIs very likely the catalyst to opening up the space age for for you and I the water can in the form of H ... hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel it's the field and rockets right on right now so the ability to take that rocket that guy from the surface of the earth to earth orbit\nAnd top it off and take it farther a mix that supply chain a lot easier and a scalable to like\nQualities that we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen\nI can get the ID 'cause there'll be a potential to the station in space for a gas station in space there will be just posting spaceships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term surely because we talked about economics rockets and now going up and down from a\nFall cheaper than they used to run I mean the cost of fuel as a proportion of an ... rocket kind of shoot him spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of a close to the overall mission so he's he's few really the deliverable everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tie that never have to feel the weight of gravity never asked to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in Italy permanently and space and it'll it'll be that shuttle that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you'll feel that shuttled from the surface of the earth but maybe when that show gets out to just say critics were bitter farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids\nAnd you're going to need it speaks colony first I mean or at least ... and I actually from sort of industry on a a population of them or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge in the business of space is the chicken in the act yeah what is the series of stepping stones that that sustainable you get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects or their multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for a hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers and of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that quick\nQuestion if you you go you've got your asteroid and your sites and you go up and you land on into prospect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we wanted to do a little small besides but it hasn't gone by then and there's going to be back for several decades\nOr that is one of the challenges of working with afterwards as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining\nWe see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons so with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for how soon will this happen\nIt's happening now has the you know you're going to have a ... starting to prospect on a particular restaurant the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions\nThe commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nBut five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources send you think the finances now yes absolutely hundred million dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but uh five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first
