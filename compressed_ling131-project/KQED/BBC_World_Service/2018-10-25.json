I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really Kevin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry I think that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nUm that important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling and you know you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things\nAt that time I saw was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end up sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless and the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news of full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Steve associate for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response for the invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school and they arouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's right\nWas that the more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmanda Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called\nDespite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me\nAlso with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago his focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is\nA Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much for have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all there yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest as an episode to win one of the parents of student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the end the conversation that we do not have about schools\nThat have the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nWhen his mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you\nKnow one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in this area that I think one of the things that struck me as the silences some of that some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate in it wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on district\nPay by the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do you believe that in mind in the conversation\nIf you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not ... main ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it but if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety\nAt the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nWe're talking about racial\nEquity professor so what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel being nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we had it\nRight I mean I think this is and thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to a man this point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least\nAnd now what are those things that he talked about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it\nAnd I think is ... is the issue and concern give me an example of getting people what they need one they needed a young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation on that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people most often happened to screw houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition\nLewis ... ... what do you find that the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity\nSponsorship that the cake you eat the life's dream my sanity from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with X Kennedy on demand\nEach grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation about racial equity it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition\nProfessor Lewis ... ... what do you find that the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is it funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the way\nWell I'm going to talk about the parks in the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our buck\nWas that when you really try to understand why changes so hard it really is\nEspecially in these kind of community\nThursday beginning at noon followed at one PM buy fresh air and then the two PM by the world\nMarket women so many stories unfold and I would not be at all surprised there were more packages in circulation from this under and on the world with ...\nYou up to date the migrants are walking towards the further north town we bring you in size migrants are skeptical about applying for asylum in Mexico and there's some good reasons for that joined us on the world\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America communities through the arts and arts education so\nTransforming America communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more at Americans for the arts started work\nFrom the door is stupid charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health and from the listeners to support this NPR station\nBefore we get back to our conversation here in Chicago are worried about what we'll be talking about in Atlanta tomorrow\nPoison it appears to be Russians preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow was targeting and why\nWe like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voicemail eight five five to ... three fix one a one egg America's relationship with Russia and what was the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but\nWhat message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a let's say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of Sergei St Paul and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax club how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to rent myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like\nAdvanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way can push too far\nThat we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity\nAnd then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one why student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not she can make Lee denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more I open experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a port besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white\nParents Charles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for any one high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general ... like there's kind of like her I say there's the blanket we put over white kids it's like you're you know they always going to be one\nRegardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of the sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like this well I I didn't want to compare thing of the students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do without extra curricula and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well I mean to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who isn't in any extra curricular lose who doesn't have any type of\nUm nine students teacher relationship with and you do in the building they like it's hard you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that like I think that's the whole thing\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream banks than any firm Comcast extended Internet delivers in home life by for all devices in the home\nOf the white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have states in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever\nI mean you got the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you're a kid like me who I mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but other than that right it was not really so you kinda have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it that's just not the case you know I think it goes\nTo show and um which episodes that we must have done it was like most of the kids and he was on the news um tutoring sessions I usually white fair and are widely so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but that was the one right but you know so well\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose Terry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years\n[noise] you know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you could take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evan stand like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens and he had the districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take it that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we tracked them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kitchen higher tax get more they get better and better teaching and so we have kids that might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks\nUm are inevitably going to uh take racial disparities that exist in our society and and reproducing in our schools and the the ... the troubling thing is that race because not only part of how these tracks get credit and if you look at the history of the really deep\nRacist history of tracking and general\nRace also becomes explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational faces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational experience you know places in the same exact school I'm a black\nShould have us all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and bought a good education is and\nYou know I've heard a few teachers including ... Williams the black or a future in the series lament the fact that is that the students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning but just ... it's a game it's in supporting game\nIf you will hear more of that coverage here on MORNING edition this morning beginning at three o clock

think it's going to be huge [noise]\nI Want to call begins with the building blocks of our bodies ourselves\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues are made of different types of cells now I've settled got told that some cells and say your liver kidneys or whatever will be dividing to replace themselves with a kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would call ...\n... comes from the ... which means to grow old and that's exactly what's happening to these cells they've grown old and come to the end of life cycle but instead of dying they hung around acting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence Sal will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells ran them so it's almost like a self saying I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a matter of time as I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about business and says well\nWow so it so much sort of contamination ... with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around it and just messing\nAs we grow older more and more of ourselves becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\nWith honey do they make the cells around them age found that these innocent sound stop functioning as they should which is still to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension concept type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Henry's wants to know whether she could get these sounds just don't have like a little cells behave more like young one\nWhat happened that was I had a new research in my lap and she was to find your feet and we have some old south and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent ship it some of these chemicals only those skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to see\nThat they would still my old south so they look kind of lacy under a microscope and we have a particular time that we can put on I felt coaches that turns blue if that's an excellent\nSo when I was expecting to see is that the south would be so blue and still looking old I'm not sure what they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south to professor Harry said no no you've got the wrong se young sales go through it again and that and she did\nAnd she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she put them back to me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly ... scientists yeah they were taught to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it said that that it probably ...\nHow many ... oh probably about nine she did it about nine times and finally I kind of looked at them to actually maybe you're onto something here\nShe done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenated on south in ten minutes young so\nAnd this is why loan Harry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all

be the most ambitious of all our expert witnesses instead\nHave human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan especially what I Want this research to end up paying you the new
