to tell me so oh yeah and I land on me\nSo the story is I was a freshman in high school um at Bozeman high school in Montana\nYes I and I was in the orchestra and it was early in my freshman year and I had made friends in high school but didn't really have orchestra friends yet and we were taking an orchestra trip so that was a little nerve wracking\nWhen you're a freshman disqualifies the demi crisis among bus ride to Seattle sharing a hotel room with someone you don't know\nBut there's this one girl Lindsay she had to have friends in common so they decided to pair up room together ride the bus together to be orchestra friends\nSo um when we go to Seattle and we're like it's awkward\nYou know 'cause we're like new friends trying to get to know each other and um and on one of our free

and we read the true Britain we ran into the hall to try to like find other people are just are like we thought would have been playing a trick on us but no one knew what we were talking about no one even remember the thing in Seattle and so I still to this day I don't know\nWhy that [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nEvery once in a while we get pictures like this at the radio show coincidence stories this

college um I was actually pledging a fraternity and I ran into some of the like the seniors and I'm On campus and they were laughing about something\nAnd so one of them tells me the story that had happened to him that day supposedly where she gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower he hears that team\nAnd he looks down and sitting on the floor of the shower between his feet

home and I don't think much about it the next day I get in the shower and like five ten minutes into my shower I hear it\nI went down and write between my he is a quarter [noise]\nSo uh my first thought was you know how did they do it like my thought was totally assumed that this must not have really happened to him that was set up and somehow they set this up it happened to me but I could not figure out how much just like you know they have to be a prank basically\nBrown human hair\nThey're teenagers they're stoned their freaked out\nThey have to tell an adult about what they've

it\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and\nWe had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover American by the way had been the Virgin Mary in someone's nativity scene

time\nFive words for you Dr ...\nNo coincidence no story\nHere's a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection if that middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because when a Vince\nLine up just so you can't help it you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that in that way coincidences are kind of like short cuts to very big questions about fate about God even people who don't believe in either one the notion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life\nThat there might be a plan Concord through coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young the daughter of a jazz

way that made it his song and he was referred to as Mr Black magic I guess back in the forties and it was a big deal at the time and\nI asked my dad had you met him you know did you ever know Billie

... explain that\nWell prince was arrested a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nThe d._a. promised me an interview for this story but he never gave it to me I asked over and over and each time he declined\nBut I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom the first person used to work for Ken is Errol as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson says how long were you a da\nAnd regular years seven years but India is a joke like an attorney\nThompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office use the habitual offender statute back then\nI was in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I mean it was just some of the standard ... law office for lack of a better way of describing it was just the way it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that that's often are statutes it was a policy has the Jazz Fest and are they in cash to use it certainly I Can't think of any answers or didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or a hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like the tennis arrow never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere is this mindset that the more people we locked up in the more time that we give people the more we're going to stop the crime problem on is fine as long as ... you know harsh winters are under turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says China's errors office still uses ... statute all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt to the first thing you're looking at is the start of every\nAnalysis of case every way you talk to your client has started very way you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge is even a consideration for the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments of your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge run leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was in the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's rattled instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it what is it a light left\nOr right this is a life like there's a lot of heavy glass [laughter] he said\nOver his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and prosecution I asked judge hunter what he thinks that this law\nTakes away the power to function of a judge\nWhich is to fashion a sense is that some focus just simply for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the ... statute judges no longer decide how long the person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kick in the judge has no choice\nIf I have someone who has mental health issues or drug abuse issues I wanted that treatment aspect that conform to be part of the sentence was introduced to a better stats is the fact that as soon as on the twenty twenty five years that won't be there now tax says the same twenty twenty five thousand a year if for someone just to go away and said [noise]\nAlso went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da Da Nang minutes away just up the Mississippi River the populations as east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to\nOf their demographics around half white half black their da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just likely on Canada's arrow\nI Lived in a shark and how are you doing sir I'll be darned on ... street\nHell or more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is arrows private Catholic high school but if they're white men both have been da ...\nYou know for me I was with him as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything there's public safety can you sir public safety with no charm a Jew or those publisher to really demand tunnel jail\nAnd the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what da Kenneth Arrow does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years ten is zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [laughter]\n[noise] I shared this number what the da and his spokesman denied at the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I\nI never her back and an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to connect more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two ... ... so different is because every da ... Russian to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFrom what you're saying it sounds like ... have the power to selectively enforce the law in\nAny way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Kennedy hero always emphasizes this hoax\nHis duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nRemiss if I had what I consider to be a prosecutor ... case and simply said I'm not going to prosecute is because I just don't agree with the law that surely not my call desperate you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not that it\nIs a law I think I ever responsibility to prosecute it if the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n\nForget ... line is I'm just doing my job was he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the actual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Ken Johnston I Am what I call\nA criminal law specialists\nAnd I heard that really you go by ...\nMay be a Jew or that you would do\nA ... a ... you know this is\nMonitored them in my wall room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stuck by his computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nBecause the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing but when Harry ... can do all those\n... we'll wait wait wait wait wait a minute here the the view to say Harry Cohn and the jazz singer\nNo that's a junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nWhen Harry ... came into office he used a multiple below to show is talking to their shows is that that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of the law is\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statute much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney Eric comic but just to use the powers rivers offers to help her into your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhibited crimes against decent citizen [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime is urging all over the country people were scared\nSilicon I played on that fear so he brought his lower back from when ... when do start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any person shot offered a convicted of and they run the show we considered as armed forces up and be imprisoned that hobby labor for live\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races Hamburg right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that patrol center laws really came in their own as part of this intense\nShe will send her last really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to smash shunning the conflict as scary African American that\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated in a penitentiary\nAnd for people who couldn't be transformed it it would become a place for storage for force labor forced labor wow\nExactly and there was no record of this\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges that have digital offender statute his prosecutors just said they well if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know can is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg\n[laughter]\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official but he did offer a statement about princes case here a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert\nVoluntarily entered into a plea agreement and received a legal sense a hundred Louisiana law if he believed himself not guilty he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy outside my hope is that Mr Albert well apply himself toward programs by which to better himself and eradicate his\nSubstance abuse issues while in prison\n\nAfter I requested to interview prance he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in

you do the first one\nTo loom I was like six years and years [laughter]\n\nPrint said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs\n\nJust wasting time sitting in
