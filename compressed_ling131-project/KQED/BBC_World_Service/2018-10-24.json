Britain to be a middle sized middle ranking nation but is no longer soup for charged by its alliances I bricks that is doing very profound damage to Britain's ... place in the world\nI think there's a danger that nice and we've got to make sure that it doesn't and in order to make sure that doesn't uh we do need to reach an agreement to the next few weeks with the EU which is mutually beneficial and mutually harmful\nAnd all those some voices in Iran's governing party are very critical of the prime minister my view is you've got to be a hundred percent behind or otherwise you weaken had the guy is a physician parliamentary arithmetic is very tight and we go we have to back up all the way to the point where I Hope and what will probably be the last minute\nWe ended up with a deal which could determine our future relationship with the EU and make sure that we do not suffer the consequences that such a major uh described\nPoint of old is is that the prime minister is being manipulated by the almost impossible pressures inside and run positive if one if one looks at how positions on things like\nThe Northern Ireland backstop which the British Government had signed up to this notion that they will always be a safety net whatever the state's us of a future trade agreement between the u._k. and the EU that will always be a safety net which ensures that Northern Ireland and the Irish republican will not have a hard border between them that\nGuarantee offered by the British as long as he got his last December now seems has been taken off the table because Theresa May ... get hit by the Brexit fears onto our allies and the Democratic union is potty that\nUh I think he'll run them is a I don't think that um she's a day being ducking leaving I think a great quality\nIs that's the reason is a unflappable and she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt that every waking day the poor prime minister takes in the last of incoming fire for many angles are mostly from the easy one to the re heartbreaks over breakfast donated dealer tool\nBut she doesn't touch and what she's doing and she is saying very clearly that ah the union of the United kingdom the full countries in the u._k. must be held together and the peace process behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United kingdom\nNow she has stuck to that but in front of them we've all just to try and find a solution which square the circle between the principles of the youth and the principles of holding\nAnd they don't just quite if I may interrupt just\nPrime minister types in the last ... incoming fire for many angles are mostly from they won't have very heartbreaks over breakfast or no deal a tool\nBut she doesn't touch and what she's doing is she is saying very clearly that uh the union of the United kingdom the full countries in the u._k. must be held together under the peace process behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United kingdom\nNow she has stuck to that but in front of them we've all just to try and find a solution which square the circle between the principles of the youth and the principles of holding\nTogether at least ... the only just quite if I may interrupt just to because we are going to Irish foreign minister Simon company said yesterday they will be no withdrawal agreement without\nThe Irish ... ... and ... story so all of this shuffling of papers and on different positions for different people in the end it's quite simple\nTheresa May is he a ... year position is hit the breaks in tears you appear to have a a means to stop treating them from from making any more concessions to Brussels based it over here there is no way of making this\nWork I think that will be a way and actually able to analyze it under the sun and cave and they use various mobbed\nAnd I'm very fair minded\nEssentially has the same objective as we do\nWhich is that we don't want to undermine the northern Irish peace presidents we don't want to ... between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island of Ireland\nAnd that essentially sort of more or less is the ... but the ... the point about Canada plus as it doesn't address the problem is it's it's still a problem so you know people can argue amongst themselves and and adopt posters and physicians but it doesn't mean that the ones that come in any way to let the\nChemo and a former cabinet minister said the other day this policy the Tory party all politics is now on to quote existential strain friendships between colleagues have been irreparably damaged\nBecause all these bitter arguments over a brick shit that language has become toxic including ... comes from Brexit fears of killing his own aims for the prime minister carrying on new since we're meeting so she could hang on a cell phone nice being turned in her body what on us is going on inside your party\nBut I I think briefings using disgusting language like that that just to be condemned to today I quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency of decorum is getting out of control\nBut the point that your party given the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now over breakfast it cannot possibly deliver a cut here in Britain deal\nActually I think it can because I think that in the next few weeks as the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have a vote in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal and I think\nWhen I hang on this is interesting figured out a vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven your telling me you can get through the British Parliament but it won't have the support surely of some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off some members at least up the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think we'll peel off a lot of those who are making noise against because I think in the end I'm In a it is probably will be the than the deal to tell them the\nTape and then we'll pay check because all of us so we haven't\nYes a death is my belief and I think we should then supports it\nI don't see how your policy can survive that your former boss well\nYeah it was ... Morris Jones and\nHe says checkers is akin to a suicide vest being wrapped around the British nation you'll respond to that was just one of the most disgusting things I've heard in mountain politics you said this is the end of Boris ... if it isn't now I Will make sure to Lisa I put it to you that if you and people like Boris Johnson who\nUsed to work for are ruling with each other even before this check a deal is put back on the table before parliament as the final deal with the Europe your policies finish\nThat because that that policy as it was bigger than the events that has to cope with in the case of ... as much a journalist and he has a politician says sometimes he uses this flurry of language and what was happening was that he was clearly intending to go to party conference in ... with a wish to undermine\nThe prime minister on race you are listening after finishing off\nAnd and that's all if you you can fall or if it's a bar is back in ... in order to try and just get in to back off I had a particular sports in the end actually that is what happened and I think the prime minister or will be able to deliver this I think talk or by people challenging a much exaggerated\nFinal four if you are wrong if parliament rejects the deal that threes and may brings back\nFor you want the best option then is it a change of leader in the ... on a different kind of bill is it a general election or is it that people are so cool people for another referendum on Britain's relationship with the Europe including the possibility we actually stay in after all\nBut I think you know to have a what they call the people say you need to act upon them to make it possible that ain't going to happen at the moment but I think that if a deal with put to parliament and it ... it ... woods cools filed race around Seventy than anything we've been discussing today\nSo everybody should have no idea what would\nIt would be we'd be getting it's a completely on that ... that what's happened and that's why I wanted to have to which is why as I as one of the older members of parliament appeal to my coffee to stick together\nOr to stop I'm having a guy that the prime minister all the time and to realize that you know if we get old Israel and we might end up with the luckiest Brexit oval pull off a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn which is like having Fidel Castro ... Downing Street\nJeremy Corbyn which is like having Fidel Castro in Downing Street surrounded by some we have to wear and that but I thank you very much for billions on how to march\n[noise] distribution of BBC World service in the U.S who supported by babble a language after the teacher's real life conversations on a new language like Spanish Italian and Russian\nThat case I hang on a second that you're saying that he's actually raised more money by saying he will not take any money from the corporate sector\nHe'll take money from people who worked for corporations but she won't have any of their political action committees contribute he doesn't want to serve in the Senate if it means that corporate pacts got him there\nAnd that kind of an appeal is very compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that'd be the only thing that can help them when does this reflect\nBen cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWatch Beto O'Rourke and other candidates that accept small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government backed is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and she's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those\nOther candidates that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government backed is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls in turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the factors you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just play ... and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only parts of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them in terms of boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making ... an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or work is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or worse campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of grudges apartments\nFront lawn fats artificial ... points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own and if he does when it was certainly send a big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaigns very differently\nThan anyone else has thought possible and I think the true test of better works legacy will be\nHow different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is thirty eight million plus on\nSo far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle\nBetter a real good causes currency losing including to the opinion polls by on a percentage point also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment ... do you think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in Texas of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls can you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in\nAny traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sex and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at the moment\nThough\nYou are for president here of our country Donald Trump [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major assets Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over oil may end up being fairly even so how might this translate into success at the polls doesn't money even matter that much Donald Trump off rule under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research of a recent years just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential in places so how should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to tie advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television but I also would spend a fair amount of money on our digital media so that I could reach younger\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side ... we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction to show if you cannot advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so that the spending that happens very early in a campaign\nYou know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race and all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early and campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close\nIf it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last you know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're gonna bring going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely ... with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things but campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive\nDistricts in states should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next in the next ten days\nProfessor of government Mike friends separate oil this also talks political advertising we've been discussing we'd do wait to see ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city":
