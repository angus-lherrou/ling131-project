I was very often not hired and not very often maybe two or three times that was very often and you think though man or woman yeah I Do think it because I think like grades were were certainly a good enough\nAnd in any event um at the time the league of women voters was very active I was somewhat active in it um I began to get active and community groups and I found\nThat this is really what I wanted to do and so I ran for the board of supervisors and was very lucky this is a cute story I a top the ticket and it's you know when your top the ticket you're president of the board you get the most votes you and this was citywide ... yeah you get the most votes\nAnd John J. barbeque a lot of who came in number two he was very conservative yes who wrote a chronicle um op ed piece a that I Am\nUntrained or I should turn it down and except for a second wow a position I thought that's a very good sense\nNot to you or just put it in the chronic it\nIt was in writing ... I thought it was a chronicle of higher I Hope I'm writing he didn't have long time ago he didn't come talk to you about no oh al ... and in any event uh I got\nSeasons pretty quickly and went on and I'm sort of nine years on the board was three times the president of the board uh happened to have been there on that terrible day November twenty second which is upcoming\nWhen Harvey Milk walk by the office and I said Harvey and now it excuse me when Dan White walk by the office it was my first day back my husband and I had gone on vacation and just came back\nAnd um yeah ... ... didn't ... didn't stop and I heard the door slam I heard the shots and everybody was gone and um I remember this so well and it's still traumatic\nUh because I tried to get a pulse in his wrist and put my finger and a bullet hole and um it was clear he was dead and that changed the world and I want\nDo one thing because you there were reports that that day before that happened you decided to give up all of that is true yeah so what made what brought you to that decision\nDay before that happened you decided to give a policy that's true yeah so what made what brought you to that decision which obviously events overtook that decision but what what was it that made you know I'm not what I decided\nWas I was not going to run for another term the board um that that was that because well um my husband had died um I remarried um I have a daughter\nAnd I just thought enough was enough\nIt's still very traumatic for me to look back on candidly because those assassinations were everything that was not supposed to happen and I would give up anything if they had not happened and um once they happen\nThey impact everything everything you do everything the city is yeah and the worry over the city\nUm because of the hatred um you had the first openly gay public official killed\nBy a former police officer and firefighter who was sort of America's all American boy yeah very hand and er yeah yeah and uh a beautiful wife and small child and really hard really hard\nAnd anyway I don't often talk of this so\nI Want you to put up with it you know we're glad I mean I think this is it is a pivotal moment for you and and your life and also obviously San Francisco\nAnd and talking to people who are around you I mean somebody pointed out to me that you know that they use all political differences literally Annan gunfire I'm and I'm curious if\nThat if you think that hasn't it sort of changed or did changed your approach to governing into politics because I think one thing we've heard on the campaign you are right now is that you can be to collegial\nUm I mean is that obviously their gun control another sort of policy things that maybe came out of that and some of the other events of that era but did that affect the way you kind of want to approach people regardless of their positions [noise]\nNo I'm a I mean I Am the way I Am and I welcome\nCollegial malady and I welcome getting along and I share thoughts and ideas um and I don't like\nUh the history on that have got into this because on and then well the as you know I became mayor\nAnd was mayor for I guess three terms and the first two years were very hard and then it kind of settled down and um we were able to put the brakes of the city back together again now was that was a wonderful experience\nWas there a way in which you felt like suddenly we're mayor or there had been a progressive mirror the struggle left the progress as in San Francisco we're so excited about Harvey Milk and George Moscone ...\nLike did that put you in an awkward position all yes\nAnd I'll tell you why I had run for mayor and I was defeated and I was convinced I Would never be mayor and\nSo and you did you lose the George Moscone a yeah yeah and and\nYou said we talked earlier that you said after that point that you were going to leave politics I mean does your losses impact not to say yeah\nI think they did um I think they did a you know when\nYou're young you things impact you differently than when you get a lot of the evening so to me and uh it really did impact me um as a matter of fact the first thing\nThat um my husband and I am in the last time I ran for mayor my husband's supported George and\nWatch yeah I'm over you need what we all you want to [laughter] say that I'm not sure how big macho any support\nOr any headed to the school advisory committee and I'm subsequently we met after my husband died and um and\nAnd CIA use of torture which he released over the object well right now we're never released the full report yeah we were able to re release of five hundred page summary which has been sold and bookstores as a matter of fact\nAnd I ... President Obama put it in his special library so in twelve years from the time he put it in and it will then be declassified the whole big report\nBut it pretty much document what happened and uh everything is which has seven thousand foot notes to it\nAnd no one has corrected anything in the summer well the CIA has corrected a few things which we've corrected and where we didn't accept the correction we run in the footnotes what they say\nI Wonder if uh you know you have over the course of your time in the Senate developed a a reputation and you've cultivated a bipartisan through collegial relationship with people on the other side of the aisle many times you co sponsored legislation\nAnd that sort of trade has kind of been criticized by your opponent in this race Kevin do well\nBy my opponent but that ... that that that's his view and uh that that's what it is it's not the way the Senate works and the the the Senate works the way it has worked\nFor a couple of hundred years but I Know it's difficult and I find\nThat if I can talk to people and work with people it makes it much easier to get something done for example it took me three years and twenty eight drafts to draft the water bill\nWhich is called the when act\nAnd I then went over and I negotiated with the speaker of the house who was a Republican\nAnd that's how we got it done and then it went into an omnibus and it was passed never would have got it done otherwise [noise] now I have to begin or end to draft another bill\nBut I guess there are some people who say well you know what that Arabs over you know we can't what errors over things done well yeah maybe I mean if you look at for example the Judiciary Committee I mean you've tried to work very carefully with Chuck Grassley chairs the committee\nAnd they're all these things are happening over the objections of Democrats and where where's the compromise say on that committee\nWell it all depends on what it is um yes I work with the chairman believe it or not um over a very difficult ... cabin on I think we had um some moment\nBut that happens to everybody or in any kind of work or job you have your moment and you put it together I'm the leading Democrat right now I'm trying to draft a big immigration bill\nIt's been five seven years since we had the last bill we worked on it and worked on it and had hearings on it and it came out on the floor we passed\nIt in the house didn't take it up so there's a big learning lesson in that for me and I want to see if I can do it can I write a bill which I can also get through the house\nAnd it cannot bills and and one of the things is that you know the president said that he was going to have a policy of separating children from parents at them and have a policy and we want to make that illegal by law we want to protect small children\nAnd we ... the doctor student there seven hundred thousand\nWe the doctor student there seven hundred thousand of them and getting their parents a work permit and getting them a legitimize in this country I'm sure there are a lot of things we can do a part of a an immigration bill\nBut it seems I mean but we have been stuck with out an immigration compromise for years it just a few weeks ago we saw Democrats leave town um there was an agreement to confirm Fifteen judges\nFast track them under the you know agreement that there wouldn't be any more justice has pushed through the committee until after the election and you guys left town and the Republicans did it anyway I mean\nWell I had the debate scheduled was a way that is that I mean doesn't that speak to the breaking down to the bipartisanship that you're talking about I\nI'll be very Frank with you this surprise me that he would do that however\nIf I think about it this president is engaged in a conscious stacking of the court federal court system of the United states of America and so they are just pushing judges through now what what happened was the hearing it wasn't the vote\nAnd we'll all nonetheless do our work we study the individual we we look at at that individuals record we know whether we can or cannot vote for them\nAnd he's so we will be there for the vote this was a surprise I have never seen that done before\nThere are some and your party and I think you could say the junior senator from California might be among them you know who feel like they have to take a harder line I mean cobble Harris on the Judiciary Committee came out against Brett Kavanaugh from the get go I think before she even that with him or certainly before there was a hearing you think that's a mistake\nNo it's her if she wants to do that she's free to do it I've always had a policy that until we get through the hearing I never announced the decision otherwise why hold a hearing and that's my view of it\nYou know common law countless going to be very good there's no question about that and it's wonderful for me because I can be a friend um\nBut we're also different and how we look at things everyone is\nAnd we've probably write differently um\nI Wonder if you know um [noise] if you feel like a that style is or not conducive to really building the kind of bridges\nThat's nonsense the Senate takes all kinds of styles I don't know what this style business suddenly is here now I get things done I get bills passed\nAnd we believe we work yeah oh yeah absolutely and I do different things among different committees we'd do share one committee we share judiciary\nAnd um I can learn from her she's the newcomer what have you lived in a hurry and you're going to be learned from her oh what I learned I mean she's very smart\nUm she's been a prosecutor you see that in or questioning and it's very interesting style you know it's not a question of style it really isn't I get the feeling you're trying to push me into some mode that I'm really not in\nI Want to ask you one question because you mentioned being the first woman on the judiciary and we openness by asking you about the trailblazing you've done and I'm curious you know when we had um minority leader Pelosi and her she talked about the responsibility she feels to be a woman at the table to to be to be there really\nUm and I just won I Wonder if you feel that if that is part of the reason you still want to do this job for another six years\nNo it's not just because I'm a woman it's because I think I'd do it well\nAnd I got a great staff and I worked in very hard and I have a letter or a level of excellence and I think that's important\nTo get a bill as good as I can get it to work with people to bring in other people's views to solve problems to be able to pick up the phone and someone will take the call and hopefully say yes that's really what this is about it's about getting things done for people\nAlright Senator Feinstein thank you so I'm like oh You're welcome thank you for thanking God that humor is is\nThat it's going to do it for this edition of

Francisco for family recipes with traditional pie ingredients\nHow is this affecting the tone on Capitol Hill\nWell it to the extent of making a ton more civil it's a temporary change I think unfortunately our politics have become very course I think the level of discourse frankly is not nearly what it's been a point in the past obviously in this situation and there's a few issues to highlight one is\nHow remarkably quickly law enforcement was able to figure out what was going on really remarkable lot of this capacity was developed post nine eleven\nOr ability to get to the bottom of these sorts of things has improved dramatically over the last several years I think politicians are generally have tried to to stay above this they've tried to take the tone and elevated\nBut the politics in the U.S has become such that's very difficult to stay there I think unfortunately we are going to see this or maybe last for a few days at most and then it's going to be back to business as usual one that's actually where still the\nInflammatory language right Joe I mean in response to the bonds that President did call for unity but then shortly thereafter he posted trace attacking the media ... tweet saying the pipe bombs are slowing down Republican momentum and so the Republicans get out and vote and what impact will this have on the right after the midterm election\nSomething about the impact will be elections but it's it's as long as I said we're we're this will be a temporary break I mean after the shooting of a baseball field the a year ago a there was like oh my gosh this is horrible people opening fire on members of Congress\nWere all everybody's like oh this is terrible for about a week so I I don't know how it affects them in terms I think that at this point of a game or run a week before election day everybody's kind of locked into their positions and mostly\nPhysicians and most of these racers is only a few percentage points of people who are undecided during the middle so I don't know if it that affects all\nLooking ahead Sean and then what will it take to press the reset button and bring the hostilities down and stop stop all they can find a Twain language and the divisiveness\nWill so the first thing that Mr Schumer and then ... came out and that was criticized President Trump for his incendiary rhetoric\nAnd there's a lot of Republicans are just roll their eyes it's been nearly a dozen fire bombings were Republican a campaign offices across the country graffiti including\nThe or Mr McCarthy zone officer touchstone strong so there are so it's a very ugly period and it's going to continue to be ugly hum I condemn the poor the president's rhetoric what ... you know the Democrats are really across the board doing the same thing and everybody needs to grow up they're going to do that a\nPresident should be held up to a higher standard though he is the president he is representing all of us and and I think he should be\nRepresenting us at the highest level possible he should be setting the Tony\nHow are you Joe and I again I condemned the president's rhetoric but when the Democratic establishment says it's a resistance movement and get in their face I mean anti maxi or\nKerosene vaccine depending on how you wanted to find her says go out and getting these people's faces\nPeople that are mentally unhinged are going to go do bad things are gonna do bad things to administration staff and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that stuff really is out of control and it's out of control I think principally because of the social media dynamic people just can't turn it off all day long it's hate hate hate\nAnd it was and it was seen some of that around the caravan of a Central American migrants as well right because there have been so many economists about how maybe George Soros Basset no evidence of that um the planes that Middle Eastern immigrants and part of the pack no evidence of that\nAnd and meanwhile President Trump the big news today is that he reportedly considering shutting the U.S border to Central Americans\nUm reportedly denying them the chance to seek asylum in the White House has also planning to send additional us troops to test and border security operations\nLoni macho stoking American anxieties about about immigration it's something that we saw a worked to his advantage by saying Trump's advantage and twenty sixteen is actually I did see now working for him off and heading into the nature\nOf wealth immigration has been an issue that voters in California around the country cared about for a number of years so well we have to understand that the underlying dynamic the underlying dynamic is one where America a lot of America feels that immigration is an issue that\nRepresents a feeling of uneasiness and so I think he is handling that I think certainly there is no question that motivating voters head of the mid term election is crucially important for both parties immigration is an issue that motivates Republicans it always has been\nAnd to the extent that the president is using it in that way I think he sees it as an opportunity to boost Republican turnout\nFor the election this November now we can talk about the long term implications of of using immigration and that way but fundamentally we can't forget where we are in the elections back we can't forget that this issue is one that does get people to the polls\nAnd how is it playing out in the Central Valley Joe you were there you are from the talking volunteers in the bay area we're focusing on the race between ... and the Republican incumbents are from the ... area and his Democratic challenger Josh Harder how was immigration\nImmigration is playing out their folks there aren't really tuned into the stuff that's going on in Washington or or you know the even the uh the the caravan for that matter immigration there was a very personal issue everybody knows somebody who is affected by it even to the farmers are who may not have a relative or who are facing some sort of the immigration issue\nUh that's that's labor it's a labor issue to\n'em and it's and it's very much that issue that race down there is playing out I'm In in the bay area's impulse Jeff Denham who's the incumbent Republican is running against the bay area he calls his opponent Josh charter who\nWho has spent a few years in the bay area's venture capitalist bay area harder and he said if he wins he will be importing bay area of values\nTo ah the Central Valley a harder says denim has not represented the belly well enough on issues like immigration on health care and so and and he is getting a lot of money from the bay area and he's got the million dollars or from people buried donors\nAnd hundreds of people have donated thousands of volunteer hours to his campaign I was down there last weekend and ...\nThere were three hundred and sixty nine people coming to canvas Sherlock Josh a harder and ... and many of them were from the bay area because there's no there's no race here they have all this resistance energies ... as you pointed out where do they go with it I'm not going to ... Barbour leaves a district isn't isn't in jeopardy so they go there it was\nInteresting to me about that raises that you know Dan is actually quite moderate on immigration issues are so so is this feeling here is that Trump is so unpopular in California and that is eventually going to kill him\nYes or no Trump is unpopular in California but he's more popular in in that district were forty three percent of the people\nApprove of what he's been doing 'em and they said yes a denim has tried on issues but he's failed he tried last year again\nHe's supported a pathway to immigrate to legalization before a and citizenship and he's failed and so they said you know he's failed let's try this other guy that's that's the feeling that harder wants to portray\nAnd Shaun S. voters are more enthusiastic than usual or is it showing up in early voting\nIt is it showing up in the early voting not just in California but across the country so just entering the studio to talk to the chairman of the California Republican Party and he said if the vote was held today the California delegation would retain Thirteen of the fourteenth seats now again that's early we'll see\nSo today the California delegation would retain Thirteen of the fourteenth seats now getting up early will see\nAn early morning um I mean the early voters are usually Republican they're white they're older and that is pretty much the same\nIt's not their three to four percent higher in their turnout than what they actually anticipate will be must turn out so I think the Republicans have a ... so the dark hair\nCaravan they've got Kavanaugh about law enforcement issues so and they have a very strong economy\nUm we had some mistakes again with Hillary Clinton coming out and falling a trial balloon people should that really matter it does matter to a lot of Republican so it's motivating Republican voters in these districts to come out and not just in California but in Iowa and in Michigan and in New Hampshire\nI I think the shape of the election has altered pretty fundamentally the last couple of weeks I think Republicans were facing some very serious headwinds going into the Kavanaugh hearings\nThe last couple of weeks have appreciably I think change Republican prospects of the point where Republicans barring some cataclysmic change are going to have control the U.S Senate they may even pick up two or three seats you look at states like Missouri and Montana\nAnd North Dakota where the president performed very well so Senate candidates are now running ahead there defending seats in Nevada and Arizona where they're doing very well on the house side I think a lot of people would be surprised if the Democrats won a net of more than ... seat\nIf even capturing the majority now so I think even that is in question so Republicans have definitely come back from the precipice of those last couple of weeks so I'm going\nTo have ... ... it's not going to be a blue wave there may be some blue tornadoes hit a few districts but the dynamic really has changed\nAll right we're going to leave it there I Know Joe it's looking like he did say Greece and we will have to post my feelings on where All right well for your tree thank you Joe carefully with the San Francisco chronicle Sean Walsh with Wilson ... chatting with the Hoover Institution thank you all ...\nAnd now our clinics the less a ... a new book argues that when today's corporate titans and political leaders try to change the world\nThey actually the service so sad oh problems they say they want to solve author and journalist on on your intense the rich and powerful are willing to fight for justice and equality if only if it doesn't threaten their positions at the top of the social order his latest book is winners take all\nThe elite charade of changing the world and ... joins us now in the studio pleasure to have you great to be here well you and your in your book you tackle the world that philanthropists who wants to do good Andrew while at the same time we hear all these ... words now a world full of terms like when when\nWe're looking at clear skies words they a little bit cooler temperatures in the sixties and seventies and we'll have justice highest twenty miles per hour for today\nGood morning I'm Steve Fox you're listening to ...

positive that like the next people mhm because of our own kind of history in this country that we're going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah ... and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um [noise] that notion mhm\nTo be\nThe next or to be like the ...\nOur identity is the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that\nI Know that I Am African I Am in Jeanette I Am also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ... and to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to be in the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves and so\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land\nWhat were your mom and dad ... speaking to you\nAnd you know ... ... with the regain yeah forty why proud like being a war was a message like look I ... you're in New York or through and through however you want to define yourself\nYou know I was I grew up with a very strong sense of patriotism a very strong sense as we are American I also was raised you aren't ... likes through and through and\nSo I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around with the level of cruise and then hip hop in you know growing up around the brand your favorite hip hop artist would be oh boy so hard\nI grew up around my public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like your fat ...\nBig pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so\nIt's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're the way you articulate your platform is do interest action off and to me it's not even that we're trying it's this is who we are and so what what it means to be American Movie grabbing like how we grew up around these values\nWas my dad\nWould go visit family in Puerto Rico every year but then we would drive to\nWe go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg\nWhat really yeah you mean like for the weekend\nWell I mean we would take a little family vacation and there'll be like ... and you were young yeah those are the two places where we went on family ... she cry [laughter] it was colonial Williamsburg and for three going out to sea off the bat\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress drink me with you know what I\nI'm an at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous but it's like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been at the process but I had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty Eighteen\nAnd she looked at it and we were laughing at it 'cause it's like it doesn't feel like this isn't my writing letters in Ireland but we're laughing at it\nAnd she says that's what you are you're in idea now and I felt like I had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that may be reasons to an interesting question are you managing your ego\n'cause I mean the truth is is that you're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games but it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\nIt is and if anything\nThe there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary in my brain and in my heart I feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the six dreams of terrifying I feel like I have this huge charred yet\nBecause I'm embodying some of the most vulnerable people in society\nAnd the issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so\nFor me\nI still struggle with even conceiving the idea of getting a call back like sometimes I talk to our team and I'm like do you think so and still would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I so worried about people showing up to my advantage\nThere was an article I think it was in the New Yorker where they made a window of rain out that when you talk to kids you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you said you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be named yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect the political tactic world no no I\nFeel like I learned it from my parents and when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nMy early enough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never organized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think of my parents are natural organizers they were so good at building community I went to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester but I didn't live\nThat kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there\nAnd that's what my family was my mom clean the houses of the kinds of people that I went to school in\nAnd my dad really struggle to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards actually the end of his life and so\nMy mom would invite the cashiers from the locals Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\nGot fifty so into talk because those are the people that are family could relate to\nThey were always about leaning in to people and the politics comes back and and that's how I practice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs my number one job is to care about people and to lean into them\nShow them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWe talk about the politics\nWhat is your puppy named do when you're hearing your dad now I think uh [noise]\nI don't know it's like most although [noise]\nI'm Sorry no it's All right is right oh my gosh no it's okay what is the prime told me what your um just 'cause like\nNo one's asked that question so [noise]\nIt's weird because like I guess I'm not I'm processing this you're asking me but it's like um\nIt's like having someone walking with you the whole time and I'm somewhat and then like you're going months and months and months and no one's acknowledging the person next to you and then it's like oh what does this guy I think\nSo it's it's a little emotional but um\n[noise]\nMy dad ever told me before he passed away [noise] was make me\nSponsorship of the cake you eighty life's dream come from in the any sleep world featuring temper Peter temper

lives are when I first met you and your like probably the geek you are like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter] absolutely\nI think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it you like\nThis really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the back story on\nThat particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in heights\nLike ... Washington Heights affect the wake of the day you wake up and I got the plug\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about ... a Broadway musical by ...\nI mean I thought Josh gene that she\nWas a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to solve them\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case is predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard salsa until I went to college so I started thinking about while I thought it was really great that the show\nPut the communities on the map there the diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself\nI wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans you know New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nDate a little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are\nReal differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the new policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised\nYou well I'm working in New York City schools and the policy field\nSo much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners\nAnd the first thing that jumped out at me was that you've got three really distinct communities of Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main or or or best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences in the communities both in ways that make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nSponsorship of the cake you eighty life's dream come from men see any sleep world he drank temper ... temper memory thumb can provide personalized comfort you when you have to help the night's sleep by reducing motion transfer and responding to a user's unique shape weight and temperature learn more at ... dot com\nThat are raised and a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Latino non Latino [noise]\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new immigrant group actually compare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what we find\nIs that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades all the different groups in the school for the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades the lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is a real bright spot\n\nNow in comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans for the New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in pairs of New York you're not having a mix of incomes in the school and the college going culture may not be as strong [noise]\nMeeting so there's a whole conversation Ron desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical things but would it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller\nBite sized pieces he's got a conversation that is being had regarding Latino elected not to the United states\nOh increasingly I think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis\nAnd now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strengthened different communities and we're really on and exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently on the United states census\nBureau's animal Community Survey which is really the baseline survey that we use for so much of our work", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29"}
