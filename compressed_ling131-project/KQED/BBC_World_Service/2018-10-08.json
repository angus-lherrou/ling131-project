{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KQED", "content": "Since the time of the Spanish conquest and wherever Mexicans and Mexican American life today that's coming up on a radio is making contact that tonight at ten thirty\n... San Francisco Kaye kiwi I north highland Sacramento\n[noise]\nEverybody from kick you in any public radio vis his political breakdown I'm Scott Shafer UT senior politics editor ...\nPart of the politics posse around here and today on the brake than we are thrilled to have with us a job applicant just hoping that voters hire him to be the governor of California\nThat's right lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom the Democratic former mayor of San Francisco looking for a little promotion to the top job in place Jerry Brown when he leaves office in January\nJay Brown is indeed leaving office we were the last time we should say we've also invited Republican candidate John Cox we're hoping he'll join us before the election [noise]\nUh yeah and he has our phone number you know I Know it will definitely death so let's let's let's sort of set this up for our listeners and for I guess you know at people who listen to the show I think no other this program is not about grilling I guess about policy\nThat we don't let that I accept that now you know that's what I prefer Barbara Lee came in with\nLike five you know rings full of a a lousy paper because it put it away when I was matrix that accountability\nI got it in my head and I don't have to bring it with me\nYou know there are places a lot of places for that on kick you really are for example ... elections that's all right we're\nCovering the election and many farms and you can also tune in for the debate next week between Islam and Cox that's going to be on farm around Scott Shafer is hosting and I was at ten am I going to operate it will be on kick you in any public radio and playing on public radio stations around the state yeah so but for now\nWe tend to govern avenues on preview nicer debate here now that I'm interested so as we said what why didn't he asked that he's got to ask and they're going to add all I don't think that that she had ... thanks so now I'm over the ... we\nWe almost always start to show and we didn't really intend to do this when we started the show but we almost always ask our guests about their childhoods [laughter] and so you it's interesting with you because you have been portrayed in public life in such different ways yeah as a sign of privilege someone who was born\nWith connections and then somebody who was raised by a single mom yeah sometimes is on food stamps how do you reconcile those two him\nAt all I Love I or my sister loves reading these profiles on me says boy they I mean that just a completely different life than the one that is the narrative and the narrative as is well I'm not well informed but it's well established and it's hard to break it yeah so the fact is\nUh people go Google anytime there's a new profile I mean they look back at all profiles and it sort of extends that narrative and it's been that case for twenty plus years I Can't\nFight it I Can't defeat it but I I well let's do it straight here now but I but I use the reality is very different and so I live with a different reality and was a a mom who was pregnant with me as a teenager dropped out of Chico state\nUm and I had two kids and was raising them on our own a few years later was separate and divorced and my father\nAs she came from no wealth whatsoever a and she struggled her entire life and she had quite literally two jobs\nUh two full time jobs and often a part time job as a bookkeeper she worked for a two adoption of special kids that the ball family of kids with intellectual and physical disabilities she uh worked in many different facets including in the restaurant industry one of the reasons I ended up uh in the restaurant business and\nMy father uh extraordinary man he's still with us my mom passed away um Eighteen years ago a breast cancer my dad's eighty four I'm struggling a little bit of dementia I'm living in a wheelchair and diapers ... he's still a big part of my life but he didn't raise me and it but he had a huge influence\nOn TALK a little bit about that because um you know he was a judge yeah I Know he was not like you know flipping burgers I mean we don't talk about your relationship with their dad was an adult\nIt was a lawyer up in Truckee, California for most of my childhood so he lived up in a ... lived up in ... county for a period of time but primarily up in the Swat Valley area\nUh and he he did odd jobs eat a little part time gig and doing ice cream a sweat since ice cream you did a little bit of work as you know with the the old a river rafting operations there and trucking news\nYou know part time on the side doing some legal work that was primarily his life he came from a really large family and help support a lot of those family members are but he never you know he didn't come from a great deal of wealth\nOr he had the privilege of a lot of interesting relationships and I think that's what's been highlighted\nOr we should be the story of his life more than half\nOf my life but nonetheless um uh he was an extraordinary example because his my time with him was er during the summer and it was always around a river trip it was always routed cars out to the extent I saw a movie every few months we'd be at a dinner for friends of the river and an Environmental Defense fund\nA legal or support for this year or whatever it was was was it was always around a cause and so the combination of my mom hardworking ...\nUm you know don't comply don't explain single mom a and then my dad sense of idealism an adventure in terms of solving my spray problems it was really the real privilege\nI had in my life so growing up mostly in your mom's household which I understand was in San Francisco and the guys moved up to her and what how old are you\nGuys and I think the like six seventh grade bounced around the schools I had ... ... as a kid and still do I mean it doesn't go away overcompensate for it and it's one of the great struggles I have still that you rarely see me read a speech and if you do you can tell what like how difficult\nYeah and and we're talking about this like say I believe and how old were you and I was diagnosed in how does that affect kind of your you know school life you're ... you know how you interact with other kids\nSort of ... I was always after school or I didn't know that that wasn't normal uh\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford ...\nUh and that shaped a lot of my perspective unbiased but they're just like she was the greatest gift that ever happened to me\nBecause I didn't know nothing was wrote nothing was linear I had to work around things work differently see the world differently struggled academically but had to make up for that in different ways in in the ... dropped of making up for it and you can learn about other aspect of your life you straighten out other aspects your life\nAnd it allowed me to think outside the box I've always been willing to take risk because you have to uh because you're never going to\nThrive in the more traditional sense\nUm and uh but it was hard for my mom I think you know anybody that's got kids and by the way I have two kids that already been early diagnosed and I struggled just trying to read with them and it breaks my heart and I'm realizing as even more powerful and putting the impact it had on her of course that she's not around for me to express that she never got a chance to be my kids\nI don't know if if what you just described is related to this but you know you talked about all the old profiles that went back and it was a Rolling Stone magazine article about you and then I'm is what you you said a lot of people talk in colorful three dimensions about their childhood for me so much of it has blocked out it's not bad it's not good it's just blocked\nInteresting but I Love that's so funny you bring that up because I was reflecting and you know on this hearing last week on a cabin on that sort of nuanced approach people are able to remember\nSome of their high school I I yeah it's a all that's blurry just broadly speaking\nChild is that a defense do you think I Wonder I mean I I honestly do wonder and yeah I think you just sort of get through the day I mean I look I don't want to over dramatize I mean my mom we were hardly indigent I mean this is not\nThis is not you know I've never tried to compete for those stories but I Am saying like a lot of folks that you know the struggles were real and I remember those crime nice listening to my mom talked to my dad on the phone and and those are indelible moment you need to try to block those things out you don't necessarily romanticize them there was no abuse was love\nA and I was blessed but it's a it wasn't you know as you're you're right it's a I don't paintings in bulk colors those early memories\nI Know I mean the people who like have these you know picture memory incentive to high school I don't either one of the things we are hearing a lot about is your family connections and the Getty there the other very storied families have San Francisco dining your dad starting going catty I'm\nTalking about that and how you reconcile that world then when it came into your world with where you were there was a once\nA year world there would be maybe every you know when I got older and we go on vacation once a year and you have this extraordinary experience\nAnd then you'd have my mom's sitting there waiting for me to get home ... hope you had a nice time oh yeah I'm not like anything else but when you were you and you're like okay I guess I should feel guilty about back to reality or anything do you work in a ... construction paper I mean quite literally for years and years janitorial jobs\nHere in San Francisco I go through all these buildings downtown and I'm like I remember clean the toilet quite literally claim that what it is not figuratively\nSo it just it it completely ... sort of bifurcated hybrid reality\nUh and and but it shaped a lot I also don't have\nFor me I don't have a lot aspiration for great wealth\nAs a consequence I see not just the glamour of it I see another side of it as well and so you know we I had that experience in in in and yet the vast majority three hundred sixty days of my year our uh different uh reality than those five days a year that were obviously expressed in in that time with my father and\nIn that family well your dad I Know obviously a lot of connections to politicians but I'm curious I mean we're politics something you guys talked about\nIt we have an escape if I was with my father was cause which slash met politics\nI'd be you know I'm not here to promote but north beach restaurants might just indelible early\nSo that was that and then there was gay marriage in two thousand and horror where you'd you know defied basically the law and I told my Irish Catholic roots yeah that was the hardest part yeah ... ... and so um I've heard you talk about this you know on parts of America and\nOther places are but you know what was that up you portrayed it as something that came to you when you were back in DC Universe for the state of the union speech\nIt did you did you I mean I was a city attorney behind you on hold me [laughter] well I mean if you don't want to get his lawyers yeah it is a ... there's so much I Want to say about what happened and what didn't happen but I there's so many good people admire that that I ... you know\nRun over a little bit on this stuff and that's hard for me and it's hard to square that and that's you know in in good people on all sides as and by the way back to my father I mean he had a really difficult time with us we'll just can't you just call it something else but he you know he's in civil unions were not even really even be debated than it was\n... Howard Dean and Vermont was only one even getting there but it never came up in the campaign trail not once you know smack in the U.S not too many years ago ... free around but right against that I said to have her was her question everything he said I vaguely remember questionnaire and I said maybe there was a questionnaire and we don't know how we either either of us responded but\nIt was novel and it certainly was triggered by that experience in Washington DC watching the state of the union George Bush's reelection state of the union\nWhere he's talking about abstinence drug testing say issues the steroid abuse and then of course the den your mom was a as a constitutional amendment to support same sex marriage and it was the way he said it and it was the way the people that I met after the speech referred to quote unquote the homosexual agenda and it just seared in my mind that need to do something I didn't know what\nA than a week or two later it manifested\nI never got that memo with for the agenda\nI ever and ever since I was on a micro amps filter [laughter]\nSo you are in office I'm In San Francisco for a family on time and and I think besides the gay marriage one of the biggest things people know about you as a scandal where you had an affair with someone who worked for you and who was married to someone else who worked for you\nLike to think universal healthcare it was well in our progress environmental quality laugh\nImplementing universal preschool or a lot of other extraordinary things are very proud\nOf yes but I Do I Do want to know what can you learn from that time in your life and what do you carry with\nI've answered that so many times that you know it was a ... I mean I learned enormous amount of was an opportunity to take pause reflect I mean you're just running\nFull speed and bring it on your main young no excuse I mean I you know I learned that I had to grow up that moment a and I had to reconcile something I did was I was wrong I don't own it had to take account I had to take responsibility I had to be transparent\nAnd I had to make a decision do I do I ...\nA lean back and and and allow the weight of what I did to collapse on me or do I move forward in a transparent way and try to build a build on that experience in a way where I can come out a better person and be a better representative of the people\nOf San Francisco and and then the other day a come out as an example of someone that you know truly a can reconcile and ultimately um make amends to the extent one can and ah and then I tried to do everything in my life going forward to make up for it\nYeah well you know in that vein I Know that you um have always dated and married very strong women your accent now dating\nDonald Trump junior to the whole not everybody I Know I ... where we get why wouldn't talk policy I Love\nAbout something that I Know you're talking about what does your wife and your family because Jennifer ... than you Mary how long ago or ten years ago ... years in a few months um she's a very outspoken feminine and how she is the second one on one\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and in post production will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA dot Stanford ... an hour where when you were married\nAnd I know what I was thirty my young thirties back as mayor and now I don't talk about my age I mean it's\nDifferent times I was literally time of life but there's also a state of mind there's the maturation you have kids that's uh that's that's a pattern interrupt that such\nA game changer in terms of accountability responsibility constancy a there is no vacation and there's no you know no sick leave at home in ... south yeah whatever mission what do you mean whatever you want to exactly however you want to describe me just you can't escape that responsibility it\nAnd uh and and there's a deep love\nA deep love and you understand that tournament a completely different way that only a parent can understand\nA and that gives you tremendous depths of empathy\nUm and I hope graces well even for others that you may disagree with\nAh that you realize there's commonality or even my you know folks that attack me I'm Still they their parents as well they loved their kids are and I think there's it allows you to bond together more broadly to uh and so I just in every way shape or form a different person and of course it is a rock star as you suggest\nAh she's now working on a film called the great American lie on wealth and income inequality in the United states through a gender lens now who's to blame but how it impacts genders very differently so this governor thing you\nYou you you alluded to Jerry Brown kind of knowing him when you were young and then becoming\nTogether do you remember what's that he was mayor of although I don't as as right he ever get\nThat overlapped uh then you both ran for governor in two\nThousand a short time Iran and then he jumped in and I thought\nBetter of yeah and so you widely alluded to this kind of a rocky relationship again with Jerry Brown\nAs so how how does that involve and how'd you get through ... in like how do you a portion of the blame for that also\nI I I'm One of those guys are you know to my biggest gripe with Donald Trump decides his policies is the victimization that he uh spouses I feel very differently I take responsibility period\nI mean it's like someone saying hey you know I'm stuck in traffic I'll be there late and you're like no you're not stuck in traffic you are traffic\nOr you know is that made it means we are our behavior society becomes how we behave\nNext time you're stuck in traffic consider the fact you're part of the problem the point I Walk to work you are or how much you get the point I mean the point is you know I I take responsibility when something goes wrong relationships go south take account to your own\nRelationship to the issue and so I uh I I learned a lot from that\nAnd look I'm somewhat again I Am going to make mistakes I I I Will take risk not reckless in life I\nI I've done some things that that I Will permit regret I Do things that I don't regret that I learned from that were mistakes and one of them is a perfect example I came out with an economic develop plant worked with McKenzie and the Brookings Institute traveled the country virtually and physically to learn about best practice and economic development had a press conference about a thousand people showed up\nA that was a mistake I don't regret that mistake was overshadowed I got ahead of the ... you know Jerry was dealing with a twenty seven billion dollar budget deficit I was focused on the twelve point four percent unemployment you had that background and it wasn't his priority at the moment and he's the governor and not\nAnd he was right I was wrong in that respect though I don't regret the effort or I Do regret or not being respectful enough\nWhere he was at that moment and I hope to next lieutenant governor considers that exists [laughter]\nYou're talking about that I Know it's hard to eat chicken was talking to a jury about these kinds of things is never easy I mean I also there's a familiarity issue\nI'm just known him forever\nUh you know Kathleen bronze Godfather's my grandfather my grandfather rants Pat Brown campaign or charity for district attorney in San Francisco it goes back generationally\nAnd so there is a familiarity that also brings I don't want to say contempt 'cause there's not because that that's a quotable thing and so I so I'm not going to say that so I went out on my way to correct that statement but I but I it is but it the familiarity met this relationship is a little different put it that way than the traditional lieutenant governor\nGovernor really well I think we're going to have to leave it there I think too much for\nComing back home of nice about Jerry you notice that I mean very indulgent

typical\nOkay and the Trump Administration has not yet said whether it will appeal this decision as I understand it [noise] um let's move on to the inspector general's report on the immigration facility in Adelanto and free to that report contains a host of alarming findings what were some of the key problems that they noted\nInspectors went that department of homeland security which oversees immigration authorities ... they found some serious violations to\nISIS image and Customs Enforcement on standards for detention they found a disabled man in a wheelchair who hadn't been confined to his wheelchair for nine days and nights\nWithout being able to sleep on Nevada and they found a blind man in what amounts to solitary confinement I went out with limited and English proficiency\nAnd they found people detainees have to wait two weeks or months to see a doctor and even longer\nTo see a dentist over a year [laughter] loses in cells and new citizens cells and at ... me out of bed sheets hanging from vans and some of the sounds that they visit itch and that's particularly alarming to the inspectors because this is a facility that has a track record of\nAnd seven people who've tried to commit suicide there since plenty Fifteen ... and one person who on actually died because he hung from South\nMichael you mentioned the Adelanto facility and dozens of China's going back over the\nPast three years when did you hear from the detainees that you spoke with\nAll the ... documentary all along has been around for a long time I heard from meetings recording serious problems with the medical care facilities for team leader dollars that's a surgery and care for having them do it to the point that there are conditions some birds significantly worse\nAnd when you saw the inspector general's report what was your reaction Michael\nWe'll look we've known about these calls for a long time but I have to even I had my breath taking away some of the allegations in the record on some of the comments from official group at the show is demonstrated a complete disregard for detainees will be there for example\nThat official who referred to people who are attempted suicide was quote suicides failures\nAnd that was also a apparently remarks for some people who needed floss that well we don't have any flaw so why don't you just used the string from your socks\nExactly that's a common for like gunpowder are referring to the doctors are brought up a veil will\nWatch and other things that they need to ensure that those those kind of brazen disregard by the end user truckers are um I think Charles from top to bottom of the facility that they really don't seem to care about you know ... well being\nAnd and other reports in the past on Adelanto have\nAlso pointed out deficiencies has the ACLU or any other organization is a challenge to federal government on these systemic issues Michael\nWill back into the other team we along with a number of other advocacy groups filed a written compliance with eyes out what are your concerns about so substandard medical care whatsoever\nBut often whether treasure consequences that he'd been a number of gossip authority that the origin notes\nResulted in part due to substandard care that the soldiers set out to resolve that complain another girl she'll numbers followed up with I expect there to fight the documentation of all their eyes are they going to win both the medical care and the dental care absurdities\nAnd for me to a geo is the company the private company that operates feed a facility in Adelanto you spoke with them you contacted them what they have to say about these findings\nDon't they say they take a defining seriously and that they're already taking steps to correct them and they are now to comply with the ad the fool's review that ice sat will do on that facility and due to this report ... officer the inspector general\nDo you think that that this will lead to any actual changes because they're happened other reports finding out other problems in the past [noise]\nThat's right I think it remains to be seen and geo I'm smarter than runs on more than a hundred facilities throughout the country and\nWe've heard from immigration attorneys and others there's problems other facilities in California and and throughout the country as well\nAnd Michael ... there are hundreds of tension centers in the U.S or what is going on at those facilities and and how many tension is now different then from\nPrevious administrations because President Obama a his administration also detained immigrants\n... and then all of the problems that are out all of those on the back you know five six years and nothing but we've seen conditions worsen or electronic ministry shows I look to the ministry and others made clear to but they're going to make as painful as possible for people to go through the immigration\nTo any more people than ever before and conditions like this sounded all auto they're tearing or white families are separating children from Paris and they're changing the rules in immigration court to make it as difficult as possible for people to fight their deportation cases\nFrom top to bottom of the ministers are going to try to eat and never as close as painful as possible\nWell that's been ministers you're going to try to make eating and they were as much as possible\nAnd so we'd have who uh is held at this facility or they political asylum applicants are the people who are caught during ice\nRains yeah I think that's very important to remember about oh this is that most of the people how to act facilities like these and they're fighting the immigration they're there because they mentioned Ki says I'm going and so they're waiting for immigration courts to decide their case\nSo yes it could be asylum seekers it could be people fighting deportation as\nSo many of these people don't have a criminal record and they're not supposed to be held and Danny punitive conditions\nBut this report make sense you know makes gives as as as a very deep down inside look at what might actually be going on in there\nAnd Michael you have met with some undocumented immigrants who actually gave up their cases to lift legally in the u._s. um even some with strong cases um according to lawyers who represented then why did that happen\nYeah truly a I've had clients who have told me that they can or to the center for the lungs of times a year the text or to get immigration and give up very winnable kisses from a terrible circumstances under which they are today\nAnd I think the bigger question which would be asking right now says why are we getting all these people in places like on a lot of freedom of the learning to to the table\nIn terms of substance people are being held because they're being punished for something wrong there simply being held there'll be available to show up for their immigration court cases and yet we know the federal government has a veil today\nExtraordinarily other mechanisms ensuring that people show up at their court hearings by placing laws supervision on April bracelets or other conditions related and so why are we keeping people locked up when the government is equally good ways insurance for about a third quarter\nAll right Michael coughing with ACLU joining us from Los

actually drive forklifts effortless and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I didn't spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involves forklifts\nAnd that's because one of the fastest growing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing stuff especially stuff

day\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over\nBy the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to fend Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reach out to them to see if I could come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility gave\nMe a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increase the automation [noise]\nAs I entered the building bears justice wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere that say no photos\nOnce a guard like me and I realized that break time tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners they have\nUnder our feet\nWe also have way more than eight hundred full time\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means in fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associate\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer promise orcas were\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like wrote\nWhich is good because I\nTo\nThat actually does that\nMean we'll see another one in a minute we called them Avi A.\nG. these automatic guided vehicles\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally a man and it follows them out of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nIt just wishes by us\n\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots as isn't always let people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room butts they're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds items operate in\nSo this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line\nOnce they do that that's when the item gets ...\nNotice I\nProvided the item\nI Am\nOne idiom how many they need to\nPick the back massager a\nSecond worker calls the orange robots over retrieves massager from the shelf and then puts it on the yellow train kind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor\nBelt state and I sat there and I played that we're going to do\nAnd I said that we're going to do it\nTop station it's what it sounds like basically the massager comes in on a yellow trait and the worker pack said into a box\nNo robots here this is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy actually\nMachine\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone or you know\nHow many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it\nYou can do that we receive our\nWorkers normally do for ship so so if you do the math\nActually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty item a week [noise]\nThe very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nLabel is created and gently place [laughter] they're on top and the\nSound\nOf air sleeping it ought to be\nHard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n... so the robot but Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like earplugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands\nOf Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says the stickers are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time and a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom\nBreaks because they feared not making work quota and\nThat workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nOn responded that they didn't recognize these allegations as accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quotas and that\nTheir attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm an Amazon I asked learn about this\nYou know we don't have and power over light individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and great benefit\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAnd its on primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with it\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talked to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern [laughter]\nSo without strong worker protections and in an average shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduate Patterson high school really why I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n[noise] [noise]

seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helps out paying rent and bills\nThe biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours the wind up to work directly for the warehouse he worked for a temp agency and the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes but on the um [noise] sometimes

ministry Thursday night at the opening little Thursday in Texas they work tomorrow you know\nYeah but some of that is a constant threat of that basically yeah kind\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel green says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for full time job at the warehouse but he works that basically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper temp agencies provides a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them\nThey take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know\nAnd the lack of work or a steady paycheck makes workers less likely to speak up because they don't want to
