campaigns have a very at trends that we are fracking folks hunting nuclear issues plastic packaging the list goes on how does that relate to selling those products\nWill be trying not to relate to it just having past president because all the states that she said you just mentioned the things that we will cap I'm passionately ... before we became a company that made\nSense we were all campaign as an activist before\nWe came and went to law and that includes the people who started last so obviously there's a whole host of things that we will care of that and we built a business that suddenly became big enough that we could use a shop fronts on our website to actually talk about the\nThings that we were campaigning about not private lives for us that's a huge buying on those issues it's not marketing saying\nOkay so this is a little just heartfelt stuff it's not anything to do your saying with the commercial end of the business know how's it affected the commercial end of the business\nWe will when he first started campaigning publicly that we were next on judge a campaign by its sales make is that we would never look at the same time because he would make you hesitate to

up\nSo when the campaign people came to you saying that sales were up this was during the spike ups campaign that was guessing all the negative publicity\nYes yes during this Michael campaign and yet it wasn't a campaign to people that was actually a recount people came to us and you know may defend called and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know and hang on in that\nIs that because any news is good news\nI think it's because then you need is good news out I Would hope that what it was was a customer standing by us that they were really literally holding hands and saying you know it's okay with you we know what you do we know why you do it and we're going to keep shopping that you know we don't care if you mess up and we don't care if you mess up sometimes\nI mean I I get what you're saying and I get the thing's a heartfelt and do you separate the two things I I suppose I'm Still slightly struggling to understand why you'd be bothered with even trying to sell soap or other products cosmetics if your campaigns are served as Britain have absolutely nothing to do with that I mean why marry the two in the first place I guess\nWe marry the two because we've built this huge brand where on the streets around the world and it will be will miss roots not to allow the people that are working on the issues we care about
