the dramatic way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the rain received those messages in a different way yeah another\nReally good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues boot camp style as such\nBecause the status going up which acts as a visual cue or obstruction by\nPolicies are defective ... ... the sensory illusion of the lasers walks in the same way it tricks the Brian by constantly placing a key and from out who as we had a bad idea has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets Raul

impossible [noise]\n\nSounds like a ... and she's African than have peace of mind\nYeah she told me broadly speaking she can now go places like the supermarket with the knowledge that she can get out of the freezing I said if she knows it's going to happen however there are still occasions why episodes suddenly come on without warning\nSometimes hunting crashed quite that way and I I can I Can't predict when that's going to be that's nothing I can do except wait for the medication to whack at the moment\nIn those situations even if she got the shoes and by ... move I call the mom and she says there are other limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm ... and ... the ground so that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the San Francisco that\nYeah I was going to ask about that I imagine econ Steve very easy to see the latest on a sunny day\nYeah mounted mentioned to me that when she goes and will to do in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she ... lasers on soft one of the drawbacks and she felt I independent not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible outdoors\nSo it's not passing solutions from out but it helps or do we know how well they swept for other people with Parkinson's\nSort of study was done and it showed that the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants off medication and when they were on medication effect with still positive as the decrease the episodes by about that teach seven percent\nHowever that was a really small sample size or in the Nineteen participants in our study\nYeah that smoke and I wonder how do these you know do they make a stand out to a lot of attention to yourself yet definitely\nThat was an incident in one of

be quite prize about\n[noise]\nSo these two ideas gospel and lays issue [noise] both of them are about manipulating the mind to make us feel old act different and they must be all sorts of ways we can treat the brain full ...\nYes it's definitely a growing area of what's happening is wearable tech stops top on laser she's\nA kind of tracking you're a scientist outside of the opposite and that means that the solutions are reaching a real ... quicker\nPreviously they would have been but among the lab for a long time so it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of start ups and you're a scientist I'm professors near assigned to show up and speaking to assert that it's very likely we're going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future [noise]\n\nThis and I think thank you among and things to all of you for listening to all tax\nIf you want to see those lazy she's an action go to our Facebook page we've made a video about them and if you want to get in

rental car companies that I'm sure people use all the time and we just decided to publish a list of all the companies for transparency the public deserves to now which companies are\nSupporting the gun lobby and I think because there was so much pressure and attention on the n._r._a.\nIn that week after the Parkland shooting very quickly those companies started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly hold their relationships with the IRA which was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to see that\nYou could chip away at some of that are as tower\nDid we see any of the major retailers pulling back from the sale of firearms for example\nThere are a number of major sporting goods store is that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that less of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these moves\nHard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact and the n._r._a. finances we know that they are\nComplaining of financial well as in court documents about it's hard to know exactly what that entails but I think one interesting accent that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the n._r._a. spending in these twenty Eighteen mentor\nTo get any formal comment from most of those companies who will drop them that support the n._r._a. but we did reach one candidate base for them that was caught up in all of these protests David lab to stores

and they must have twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time and it was ... and that there was a lot of\nEmotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take action based on\nWhat we were seeing and what we're finding primary in our social media channels [noise] so what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and

cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey've got it up for sale I don't think it's being sold yet\nI'm just make an observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves [noise] goes up in this boycott of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the eighty one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I said that

million dollars total money they really didn't have money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reporting on to the American media in recent months\nAnd their difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner in America is an older
