Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow hey everyone pay us my age either the narrative has changed so many times it's election cycle are we just seeing a normal tightening\nIt was like early September just after the summer when everyone started hitting where people were starting to look at Arizona Tennessee Texas all my goodness everyone wants to talk about the Texas senator yeah this is still writing a joke right well you know some of that has fallen back to political gravity and political reality\nYou know a lot of people will get to the cabinet confirmation battle and the fact that Republican enthusiasm spiked\nBut a lot of this is just natural tightening and in states like Tennessee and Texas there just happen to be more Republicans\nThere we started this cycle with Republicans very hopeful that they can pick up three four five seats because the Senate battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular\nAnd to me what's been the interesting thing about this cycle is that those dreams have gone away that yes there was that blip of democratic hopefulness and the fall that oh maybe they could pick up a couple and hold their own everywhere and maybe even the perennial pipe dream of Texas\nCame up again but now we're back to where we were and Republicans are doing worse I think in the Senate battleground than they should be given the map and given the great economy that they've got\nWe've entered that final few weeks of an election that's kind of the dark side of the moon where there's not many from data points but suddenly you see wild shift in how a political observers view things the Democrats might be fine after all the Democrats might be totally screwed [laughter] I I think it's just hard to tell especially in\nThe mid term where it seems legitimate that enthusiasm is higher than before we just don't know what that means in terms of who shows up to vote compared to typical midterm\nStill I have to talk about a few specific races that we're looking at maybe we could all just go around and talk about what particular race has been really interesting to act and why maybe it tells us something bigger broader about the overall political culture at mar you want to start\nWe're died into winter I mean they did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this\nWeek as White House counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise and white matter that he left\nThe bare Bones Are these he is already out of his office\nIn the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House\nDon McGahn is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else he will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney ... below me\nWho is well known in Republican legal circles but while Siblani is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay and Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for a vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he has a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nIf you don't feel like as I'm listening to describe all of this feels Harry inside already to me right in terms of who's who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over for the last well connected guy in up pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks and is that a fair assessment\nIt is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton card in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump number of times when he was on the verge of firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court an appeals court levels over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives considered that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nIt take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller um McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed you did and that was apparently can don't within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible uh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign\nAll that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump campaign or does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood she has been handling much of the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative\nArrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nAnd do you want to ask you about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but if he is not the president's personal attorney where does it\nCampaign or does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood she has been handling much of the mole or motor and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to it as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nI Do want to ask you about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency\nBut if he is not the president's personal attorney where does a person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency began\nAnd maybe that's ambiguity which has really been with us for very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about those brand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabited are we're loyal to the institution of the tradition of the office or to the humans who have helped me off where it is one in the other begin drawing that launch never been easy but it's never been more important\nAlright well thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches us up on some of the headlines that we may have missed because of all the other news it's been happening I think you're right\nThat [noise]\n\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back [noise]\nSupport particularly D comes from Berkeley rep presenting fair view a new play that tackle thorny questions about society and race in a fully unpredictable and thrilling theatrical experience now playing Berkeley rep dot org and from quick\nEnd to end data management and analytics platform that helps them power every one of the ... the organization to explore their data and make discoveries that can lead to change\nOn the Web that cue L.

H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here you mean you could start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nFor the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that he's running against\nBecome law and we'll talk a little bit more about that he's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director under national security council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district you can't touch with a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money funneling into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it is it a little bit more detail about who lives in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so\nIt's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter I mean given her talk to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you saw MacArthur you know really go all in all ends that repeal effort I end this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that\nGoes and jellies that what you're hearing a lot undergrad friends or is it about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nRepeal health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what\nWe're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really what had changed the current health care structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment whites\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt\nOut of parts of the law and Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip from twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it in their favor\nAs the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those work ... and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions a line that we might not have heard say four years\nAgo it's amazing to see Republicans on their back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place\nThat ... thank you so much You're welcome and thank you Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY you gotta\n[noise]\nThis is the politics you from NPR and we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nSupport for

F. dot org\nAnd from the east the emcee foundation at ISI MC foundation\nDid president he made climate change at core part of his platform he touted signing the Paris climate accord as a major achievement\nAnd today the room has officially across Russia for the Paris Agreement to pick a fight but fast forward it twenty eight to ... we're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement\nPresident Trump now ... pulling out of the of course is one of his major achievement\nAnd he says it's one reason Americans should vote for Republicans and fall\nBut since Trump was elected president the country has experienced some major environmental crises and Democrats are warning that Trump's deregulation are one reason climate change is getting worse\nAnd joining me to talk about all of this is NPR's Ayesha Rascoe who covers the White House and NPR's Nate Rott who covers the environment\nHey hey hey I just a couple of weeks ago the United nations released a fairly large comprehensive climate report that I Will say is a lay person a seemed pretty dire um what what are the experts saying at this point about climate change and specifically what did we get from that report\nThe longer the short of it was essentially that the world is not doing enough to cut carbon dioxide even with the commitments that you know countries have made a with the Paris climate accord\nSo barring the invention of some non existent technologies that can ... you know massive amounts of carbon dioxide or the atmosphere and warming is going to reach a really dangerous level far sooner than people think possibly in my lifetime assuming I Lived through LA traffic\nAnd certainly in the lifetime of our children which I think is kind of shocking for a lot of people\nYeah it seems sooner than I had certainly anticipated some of these threats becoming a reality which was really eye opening\nAnd I should say that since the twenty sixteen election I think there have also been a number of pretty large scale natural disasters California had its largest wildfire in state history and just last week hurricane Michael was the strongest storm to\nHit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history so I'm curious how you say if you get a sense of whether voters see the environment as an issue that is being discussed politically\nI don't think voters see it as a top issue it usually in polling it's something that voters do care about but it's not a top issue it's not like health care\nOr those kind of like bread and butter issues not because it's not important but I think because just as you just talked about it seems like for people it feels like it's far away is something that can do that with later\nDo support for ... comes from the corporation for public

I figure out doing this for the news with us from NPR's fall\nThe lesson and wait wait don't tell me Saturday morning at eleven and again Sunday Morning at [noise]\nKick you in the San Francisco and kick you we are north Hyman Sacramento in my mind at ... dot org good morning I'm Michael state the time one o'clock\nTonight on gay community newsroom with less than three weeks to go to the November elections I look at the California congressional races and how Silicon Valley as being tested by the Sony crisis plus we'll hear from say senator Kevin Dario the man trying to win Dianne Feinstein faith in the Senate\nThe photographer who brought us an intimate view of President Obama's White House is visual commentaries on President Trump has made him an Instagram star\nHello and welcome to taking weedy newsroom I'm ... with again tonight with politics around the states some high stakes congressional races are turning nasty and San Diego county Republican representative dumping hunters campaign has tried to portray his opponent as a Muslim terrorist\nMe while in the Central Valley representative Devin Nunes is attacking his hometown paper calling the press there'll be a left wing rag for its examination of his business interests\nPlus the Trump administration's latest foreign policy\nChallenges from immigration to how the disappearance of a journalist is putting pressure on America's relationship with the Saudi Government\nJoining us now to discuss all these issues are calling their new ... senior writer with political John Meyers the Sacramento bureau chief for the Los Angeles times he joins us via Skype and John Walsh a Republican strategist with\nWilson's Walsh consulting welcome to you all let's start with the Saudi crisis President Trump now says it means that uh the Saudi journalist Jamal to show chi is dead but is not holding yet and Saudi crown prince responsible\nOr yesterday we also saw treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin after much pressure saying he will now pull out at the investment conference coming up\nAnd shot and what kinds of challenges and does this case that for the Trump Administration\nThey're huge um huge they're our largest arms purchaser California's actually dependent on Saudi oil coming here 'cause we're a bit of a fuel island uh the economy in the stock market can be very spook so right now the economy is thriving and this is all coming right for the maternal election can be huge implications\nBut look this has been going on for more than a week I intelligence sources say today that it is inconceivable that the Saudi stint on no what was going on and that a conflict but at this point they're ripples in California\nWhen you have six billion dollars in Saudi investments in Silicon valley and a huge pension funds and universities that also have\nInvestments hair a there's going to be pressure now for people to say do we want it are these does this represent what California is about to have a ... in essence with this government when this contention is that they dismembered\nEight and a journalist for the Washington Post in a ... it's it's the outrage is just ... I think\nWorldwide and so where do they go from here because again the Saudi ... well fun own states in countries like over ... family is of dollars of investment in Silicon valley and the tech industry as a whole\nI think they have to be they have to get all their facts straight and there's a he's not the case the crown princes other folks there so how do you take appropriate measures against the people who perpetrated by go a little bit slower get all your ducks in a row don't shoot from the hip\nAnd then when you do at the you know so it has to act for for freedom and have to act for journalistic integrity and it has to act in its interests but it has to act smart\nAlright let's let's move on to and from the hip I was usually shooting from the hip is what happens during the election season right I mean we are right before an election day and this kind of international crisis tomorrow's ramifications through campaigns world people being consistent on a message is hard to see this year\nAnd also another issue that's been big as we approached in terms of immigration\nA John and we're also hearing all it a lot this week about how irate President Trump is over the caravan of migrants traveling from Honduras our southern border awesome yesterday we are we learned that national security adviser John Bolton and White House chief of staff John Kelly\nI got into a huge argument allowed argument over immigration\nWhat does this say about how the Trump Administration is executing its immigration policies right now\nJohn [noise] a policy wise or the best you know that's that's a tough one answers are certainly from my perch here I mean I think that uh there there've been so many questions throughout all of these mumps about hum as a policy been consistent hasn't been a communicate it clearly does the administration have\nA plan in advance for when a families with children have been coming to California but the politics of this again I get back to the ... election day is around the corner this is a live wire which seems to me especially for Republicans running those contested seats in California\nEvery step of the Trump Administration makes you were going to be\nTied to I think by your democratic challengers this fits really by either\nI think John you're off in so far as I think this puts attention to the fact that we are failing policies at the border\nKeep coming one eighty seven we know how that played out for the Republicans in California and I'm Wondering as much as it may energize some of the president's base will it also energized Latino voters democratic voters\nWho see this is the same thing President Trump is trying to play this caravan as some kind of national security threat it's not an end to your\nPoint because they keep coming I think that's why we're seeing this frustration out right and ... and his tweets and how I wait is over the care of that\nAnd there's also now much speculation about a new White House proposals to continue pursuing a family separation policy basically offering parents have a choice and you can stay in family detention with your children are as\nLong as you're immigration case proceeds it could take years or you allow your children to be taken to a shelter or two so that other guardians can take custody so Carla why is this issue coming up again now and it wasn't it settled by the court I mean this\nIs ... it's it's just kind of amazing that and considering the kind of press that he got the first round on this family separation we know how it plays with women voters suburban women voters particularly who are going to be\nVery very influential ah the immigration policy at the Trump Administration right now or is it is I guess kind of amazing in terms of the way it's grabbing headlines not only on family separation but an H. one B. basis where the idea of letting spouses of H. one B. holders now\nNo longer and that can really affect Silicon Valley also so ... on on both these issues I think the Trump Administration is playing a risky game uh with with regard to immigration is\nWhat I was going to say I just think it's a live wire I mean I think John made a really good point a moment ago and and it could certainly play well Republicans it's just a live wire I mean no one really knows where it's going you're talking about a president who works without a safety net\nUm and I think you know a lot of people are going to have to watch every ... Washington\nAll right and and speaking of of live wire and mid term elections a job let's talk about some of the congressional races you bought them up earlier some cake rational races are getting very nasty\nI especially that Duncan Hunter race or the Republican Duncan Hunter was a over the summer indicted for campaign fraud and ask this race for tighter he is stepping up his attacks on his Democratic\nChallenger Omar ... I'm I'm Sorry mark ... tell us what he's been doing\nWell I mean you know this is the one of those efforts were were you know the candidates trying to distinguish himself from his opponent and he's saying his opponents too liberal that would be the most charitable version of what congressman offers to the last year ... version of course he said he suggesting that his opponent\nHas ties to extremist groups across the country across the world I should say certainly linking back ... years opponents a grandfather who was involved in things in the past\nIn terms of the uh the the kidnapping of Olympic athlete decades ago it's an ugly race in what I find you know really interesting is that the Duncan on a race wasn't on the radar of battleground races in California\nUntil uh the indictments came down and and that's a solidly Republican district down there in Southern California and uh you you wouldn't think someone could lose it but an indicted congressman or in these circumstances you know\nAnd also he called him a radical Muslim and accomplish are as Christian\nYeah exactly and I think and I think all of that raises some really fascinating questions about about where the line is and campaign strategy to your point we are accusations that it is way over the line I'm Duncan hunters probably in the race in his life right now I mean certainly are the best case scenario is that he wins the worst case scenario is that he\nWill actually nearly wins and maybe even a further a prosecutor in the courts the worst case scenario he loses and he's prosecutor and the court I think he's fighting for his political life\nIf you're a successful in November if you're elected to go back to Washington was the first thing you'd like to get done falls is several\nThings I think that for health care for all I Believe Medicare for all not Medicare for some of the central threat of climate change I Want to put this nation on a truck to one hundred percent clean energy by introducing a national clean energy plan and immigration before\nWe need to leave the rest of the country because we had the largest number of immigrants in the United states right here in California we need to be leading voice for those are the three main issues that I Want to move forward that can grow this economy put people to work and bring prosperity to all Californians into all American state senator Kevin oil thanks for being here so I think you\nWant flick now we have an interview with Senator Dianne Feinstein scheduled for next week and we hope you'll tune in then well they are now to politics and pictures as Steve official White House photographer for President Obama pizza that spends a lot of time with him and took a lot of pictures roughly two million a fat it\nSays it became an Instagram celebrity by documenting the White House\nLately he's become even more famous for using his picture taken ... at the current president posting photos have Obama on Instagram with catches that challenge tweets quotes avenues from President Trump\nSays that has compiled those photos into a new book titled shade a tale of two presidents\nPaintings and joins me now in the city you nice to have a nice for having me on a first off and those who may not know at at that\nTime I don't get booked shade place out the faith throwing shade can you explain what that means\nUm it's it's making snarky comments uh about an individual or individuals that maybe you're\nNot so positive\nWith that you're in ... when you started posting stash of photos that President Obama a on Instagram with your own caption [noise]\nThat that was my intention I just didn't know it was called hurling shade [laughter]\nAnd and um why don't you feel a need to do that to put up these photos with\nCaptions that they find the contrast between the Obama administration and trying to think strange thing\nI mean I saw how difficult the job it is to be president how serious President Obama took it he respected\nThe opposite of the presidency so much and we don't see that now\nAnd that was the reason why I mean if Mitt Romney or John McCain or Marco Rubio had been president\nI wouldn't be doing this because they ... I Know they would have respected the opposite of the presidency\nBut now he's got a guy that lives every day he bullies people\nUm it he's disrespecting the office I felt I had a voice to speak out\nAs a private citizen now you can like you can I can absolutely and and I want to show picture here one of the uh pictures from your book from your Instagram account a picture of of President Obama talking with female aids and you added a new caption that says\nRespect for women now clearly this photo tick on new meaning for you more recently given current events\nHow often does that happen when a with your photos in that in your perception of that changes over time\nWell I think it does you know the interesting thing about my instrument fetus sometimes I post something or in a reaction to something he's tweeted or a news story\nAnd posted on Instagram and people don't know what I'm referring to and they have to go Google to find out what happened that day you know in the in the book I make it very clear\nWhat I'm referring to because on one page you see a Trump tweet and on the other paid juicy my response\nWhen you first took that photo though what was your thought than just another meaning\nIt was just another me and I'm you know President Obama had a lot of\nWomen in top positions\nI made his last three years the top\nIn before the ... those were the best trips when we got to do something like that\nAnd that you get to see another side of him that we don't\nKnow what I mean the the great thing about my job to as I saw him in all compartments of his life I mean I'm In the situation with them but then I'm often with him and the girls are you know him and the whole family and so I saw all the aspects of his life\nAnd he's not any different than than we perceive it than most people perceive he's probably funnier than people realize he's more discipline and people realized\nA but it's not like really different uh you know behind the scenes\nAnd and as you were photographing him did you try to be a sign of Wall Street develop more of a closer relationship with a in a conversation relationship\nYou know a conversational relationship with him but you know my job was to be an observer it'd be a record or a a visuals\nAnd there were some days where I I may not say anything to them and other days um you know we might have a conversation about\nYou know our family or the ball game the latest ballgame that kind of thing\nWhether they decided not to photograph or perhaps or choking cats photograph\nOr no I mean I I pretty much had access to everything and um the all every single photograph that I made one point nine million every single photograph is now in the national archives\nThat's so amazing I mean that's a lot of photos by nearly two million how would you go about finding the right picture when you want to publish something do you have a special assistant of organizing your photos\nAnd that was pretty much just up up here also you know not a million I mean what are my basically I'm\nI'm I'm I'm choosing photos from one of the ones that we had made public while he was an office we made a given his his a level of transparency we made lots of pictures public on flicker Instagram Facebook White House dot Gov\nAnd so all those pictures are stored in my head so oftentimes when Trump makes a tweet I Know exactly which photo I Want to post\nYou were also and official White House photographer for President Reagan what what's it like working in the Reagan White house\nIt was different I mean Reagan was in his seventies and I was in my twenties I was not the chief photographer to my level of access was not as good but I did get to know President Reagan a little bit and he respected the office of president you know politics aside he was a decent human being\nUm so I sort of feel I can make this case now\nAh and and not and not be called person because I worked for both the Democrat and Republican\nAnd you and you feel like they handled the president said in the same way or in a similar matter despite their policy differences\nI mean it's like a President Reagan was more of a big picture a guy\nI'm ... and uh you know just because of because of his age he wasn't as active\nUm but but I you know he respected the office and you know as much as President Obama did\nAnd I know this is like asking someone to name their favorite child that you have a favorite photo from your Obama days\nYou know there are so many I mean my main goal was to create the\nBest photographic archives that it's ever been done on a president\nAnd I I'll let other people choose which they think are the favorites or the most important\nWhile you created quite an incredible archive ... has been such a pleasure to talk to you and

was gone and they have no idea what happened to\nNow one tonight that is completely contrary to that and yet everyone here acknowledge is\nTotally incomplete or totally unsatisfying and will not fly on Capitol Hill so the president is far from out of the woods and in many ways is deeper into this to ninth and he was before\nAnd what about Jared Kushner he he was the one who was working with Mohammed bin Salman saw him as a reformer where does that stand with Jared Kushner you think about uh the secretary of state over there meeting with the royal family but there's a peace process continue this this is Jared role continual\n... Jared Kushner really made this relationship with Mohammed bin Salman a kind of his claim to have influence in the White House he cultivated this guy they're both\nAre young men in their thirties they're similar in the sense that their heirs to ah to families with large fortune uh so there was a sort of an affinity that Jared Kushner a really really played on and so for him it's arguably an even bigger set back then it is for his father in law uh\nWe understand and we've reported that Jared a kind of advice leading up to tonight's announcement was to stand by a NBS we'd known by his nickname NBS I'm at and that that the that in effect the world would move on after a a decent a period um\nThat's clearly not going to happen in terms of what it means concretely for Jared I mean it's worth pointing out that NBS and the Saudis had already told the Trump Administration we will not publicly advocate on behalf of your peace plan because you move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem which was so alienating to the ...\nThe embassy in Israel to Jerusalem which was so alienated until the Palestinians like I'm not really like the Saudis helping them with Iran they love the Saudis helping them with Iran and actually that's really important because uh next month\nThe president will impose the next set of very serious sanctions on Iran for oil and central banks sanctions and if they don't have Saudi support for that it undermines that are so they're\nMaking sanctions on Iran taking sanctions on out on Iran what about on Capitol Hill or is there are the Republicans on Capitol Hill going to really push the president to take some action\nI think that's one of the pieces it's going to have to unfold again you are seeing a lot of just pleasure from people like Lindsey Graham who unsurprisingly is highly concerned about this particularly given the explanation coming out for the Saudis tonight the president now saying that he ... he just said today in Arizona He wants Congress to be heavily involved in whatever it is\nSort of nebulous severe punishment against the Saudis he may impose I'm ... but he's also potential with it or the sanctions are reporting is that is made the unlikely here and given the relationship between these two\nThere's also another administration figure who play than it is and that's treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin because he may have cancelled that trip but he did he was supposed to take to the business conference next week in Riyadh\nThe Washington Post report he is still going and I'm told by a scene right at the official that is because it has it relates to counter terrorism that's where the center as it happens to be he's got to go in order to facilitate that agenda\nBut what signal the question is what the letter sent to the Saudis if a top cabinet member in the hours and days after this news comes out and it just continues to unfold over the weekend Monday Tuesday ends up taking the strength\nAnd so that's a great point because you've got the secretary of the treasury saying Abby that he was not going to go to the conference but he's still going to Saudi Arabia and you have congressional Republicans saying we'll talk about sanctions were not going to really take a move before the midterm elections and then you have on the side\nOf the American right a smear campaign against them all to show the talking about him as a friend of Osama bin Laden while he was an embedded reporter covering bin Laden and the war in Afghanistan in the eighties and nineties talking about him as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nAssociations with them back in early in his career but he moved to the ... the center of the more secular side of politics a journalist and all of us was swirling around and it's getting more noise every almost every hour and\nThat is the story of the Trump Administration the mixed signals the mixing of messages the creation of noise around things I Would add other times be\nFairly straightforward and fairly clear I think that as part of what is happening here Republicans on the hill are making a lot of noise right now but I think we should be very careful to assume that they're somehow going to step out too far in front of President Trump they might push him in a particular direction but by and large\nI Believe what's likely to happen is that they're going to come up with something or some form of punishment that President Trump can live with he's\nAlready said he's in favor of some kind of severe punishment but continues to reiterate that he doesn't want to pull back from the arms deal\nAnd I think that on the other issue of a human rights on on journalism on free speech\nThe administration has already made their position on that clear ah it's notable that tonight after all of this has unfolded the White House has said absolutely nothing about who ... was he was a person who spoke out against things he disagreed with in in terms of the Saudi Arabian government which is what made him\nA target the administration is not acknowledging that even with a single word and that enough itself\nTells a Saudi Arabian government everything they need to know\nFinal thought on this mark when you think about Mohammed bin Salman could the Saudi royal family purge him at some level or just the people below him 'cause he actually face the consequences will\nThe truth of the matter is that American intelligence has limited visibility into the inner workings of the Saudi royal court it looks like his position is solid he was a designated areas amassed a lot of power\nOn the other hand a U.S over the Saudi experts that I interviewed earlier in the week\nTold me that in the time he's covered Saudi Arabia which has since Nineteen Seventy eight he's never seen a period of greater domestic political instability so it is conceivable that this could be the prelude to some upheaval within the kingdom and if that happens that would be a greater level of uh people than we've really seen in decades and Saudi Arabia\nLet's turn to the mid term elections just weeks for what President Trump has been crisscrossing the country campaigning for Republican candidates and raising money for his own reelection bid\nAnd just the past quarter Mr Trump holding more than Eighteen million dollars\nAnd started his presidency Mr Trump has raised more than one hundred million for one hundred million dollars for his twenty twenty reelection campaign is short term goal is to capitalize on the momentum created by the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd tap into the culture war hoping to ensure Republican control of Congress his message\nThis is a referendum on him\nAll of extraordinary progress is just say\nI'm not on the ballot taught at a certain way among the balance to please go out in the\nImmigration is also at the four this week in the closing stretch with a caravan of migrants traveling from Central America to Mexico and possibly to us the president is threatening to send US military forces to protect the southern border\nImmigration right now is is it a base play by this president he hasn't gotten the wall done for his core voters now he's really he's thinking more about the family separation policy he's talking about immigration at every rally\nAre seeing shades of closing arguments and twenty sixteen now as the president makes one White House official described to me at the closing arguments now headed into the midterm yet it's jobs and the economy yes as the Supreme Court battle because you know that energizes Republicans but increasingly over the last few days as the news and this migrant caravan\nThat by our reporting should be making its way close to the United states born or two to four weeks

com\nAnd his party held power inside the White House the president acknowledges that but I Will tell you that a lot of discussion about the house probably gonna go democratic if you look at the numbers and now they maybe that's not quite as much of a done deal as everybody thinks although that when you look at sort of probability I think a betting person let's say\nMaybe ... then how he brought up the closing days or the twenty sixteen campaign it's an interesting comparison because you have the president out there at these rallies given all these interviews and no\nNo president has in modern times has done with Donald Trump is doing in this midterm\nNo president who's been underwater with his approval rating has come close to doing what he's doing which is to make the mid term all about him all midterms particularly the first term of a new president former terms are about the president they are a referendum but he's he's putting that on his shoulders [noise]\nUm I think she has confidence in his own ability to rally the base or he is going back to basics with the messenger there's a very hard edge messenger it's law and order and it's a crime and its borders it's all the cultural hot buttered buttons that he used in twenty sixteen um\nHe is he is giving interviews constantly he's giggling with reporters constantly you we may not have White House briefings anymore but the president had out there all the time he controls the conversation and in that way he is trying to gin up his base\nA lot of tension inside of his White House their chin enough attention and emotion on immigration but chief of staff John Kelly reportedly got into a bit of a squabble with the national security adviser John Bolton about the border\nIt's become a a venue for a power struggle that is often inevitable in the White House the John Bolton\nAnd John Kelly are fighting over who can be closer and more influential with President Trump and I think there's a you should probably put your money on the person to side with Trump on the idea that this caravan of a huge issue and it isn't being dealt with adequately because that's how he uses issue but um\nYou know I think that John Kelly is someone who is trying to protect his protege over at the department of homeland security\n... and on this issue has\nFor many many months put her in President Trump's crosshairs and she's
