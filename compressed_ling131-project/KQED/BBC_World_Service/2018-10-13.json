Republican exclamation exclamation point\nYeah and and I have to say that line in his speech it was not improvised that was written down\nThis is very intentional right this is coming from them and it's it's kind of a strategy I was talking to Frank Luntz\nWho is a a well known Republican pollster and he said that he has advised Republicans to uses language he said because he feels like it's an accurate description of the protesters at the Kavanaugh hearings and of the way that they were behaving\nAnd Kelsey Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is also using this language and particularly upset about those protests um and you know people following senators in the hallway to to try to make their point in the lead up to the the cabinet vote\nWhere in sort of an unusual thing for twenty

Holly hey guys\nHey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well the other right\nAnd that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their basis because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut ... why aren't they voting\nNo one is complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I could ... kind of on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also as\nThere are some people who actually just obstructed from voting like they want to do but they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of not feeling like their vote matters but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerged and also I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for\nThe audience sure sure I mean still the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundits talk about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it's even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a right around the Las Vegas strip and\nWhy it went there in particular was that it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd it's at Eighteen to twenty five or twenty nine year old is how the oh wow that's not even that young and it was a young guy I met his ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd you know he basically was very confused with the system he initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he's registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nI've never voted before morals from what all I Know about voting as you show up to ... I don't know what I Need to bring I don't even know what happens during their\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think to him like\nHe was the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote which I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies is is\nSort of things that we assume people know but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen to twenty\nNine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year kids who have like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections and mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen that's like back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that\nI feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient so they don't feel attached to that particular place that they live in and she'll be Mavis actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks the registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo Nevada and he felt like he didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people that it's transportation and just sort of logistics of trying to get to the polls and they may not be stakeholders either younger voters\nAnd that they don't have kids in the schools like ... there are things that happen later in your life they get you more engaged in politics even at just at the local ...\nMore engaged in politics even at just at the local law but there's also this belief that they don't think that they know enough which I Wonder if the if this is a factor of just being young when you look at surveys you'll see a large percentage of young people say that they don't think they know enough\nTo be able to ... and so therefore they don't want to cast a ballot for someone if they don't actually know who this person is and I've heard that by just knocking on doors and talking to young folks as well\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back\nSome of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involved health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had a close Senate vote in fact as close as the Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty ... not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot of but they're real cheap you could have this for three months of the kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement\nOf the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd um so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change\nAnd that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty fifty so the regulations were made in place Ron tell us about the potential downsides to these plans these plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so\nInsurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think cut above my care guarantees they will get\nPerhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama

charge\nRepublicans one stop them major tax cut they've had we'd be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an all out looting of America\nThe wholesale robbery of the middle class we're going to dig into the policy of the big tax law and how that's affecting the politics\nTo do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered this more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are ya good with you so Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed this thing let's talk about what was in it can you give us a quick recap of what was in this big tax bill\nYeah the big top line things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate for thirty five percent or Twenty one percent\nThey also made things a little bit simpler for individuals they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit\nBut they also lowered the cat on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments\nThey conduct that well they Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill in check and they put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write to them that off\nThat is also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread it on evenly across people with different income brackets\nJust got this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark are three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month [noise] those are pretty healthy growth numbers\nPrivate economist and the c._e._o. forecasters they think this was a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional\nYeah there is a nonpartisan official scorekeeper is for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House think no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings\nPut that into new plants new equipment new machinery that's gonna make workers more productive and that we're going to be sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nBasically we're going to go into the mid term elections where people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of a conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nThe deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the early days the recession it was kind of high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficits expected to be\nDoctor and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nBasically we're going to go into the mid term elections where people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned to\nThis is not a hot matter of a conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days of recession it was kind of high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficits expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans wanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to use until it's not usually message from Democrats as as just a tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means\nThe government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to raise people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that day he was a very real clear politics shows that thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapprove\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high water mark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers are and and for a\nThe tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now printing right around where President Trump is forty percent were lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut is that where it's going to be a as we approach the midterm elections they would be disappointed I Know that's where it wound up\nIs the tax bill becoming sort

meanwhile an unprecedented number of women are running for office nationwide and that trend\nHolds true for California as well here now to discuss all of this our political senior writer Carla ... G O P political consultants or Tim Miller\nAnd Katie politics government reporter Katie Orr nice to have you back\nWell Tim how much of it and general and boost the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's gift Republicans either\nTo Israel a there was an the intensity level on the left or going into the hearings who's already in a weapon on a scale one to ten and twenty and it was humid like uh and and I think that'd be\nA intensity of the dispute or the the perceived a grievance the way the media and some of the Democrats in the Senate handled the appointment has really fired up the Republican base and I think we're better that done also is it dumped trails of\nWhat usually happens in the last month in the mid term election which is that people move to move to the uh moved to their camps right and maybe they are ready for a little while pretend like they're going to vote for the other side but uh the heat of the campaign all the television ads people naturally move home so I think those two things together have given the Republicans a little bit of a boost from where we were able to\nGet I'm just wondering if the high that Republicans got a from the confirmation is going to be able to sustain itself in the election I Know the anger factor having been out there on the campaign she'll seems pretty high on the Democrat side and and I know that we had a political morning console poll to show that\nMost Americans were not in favor of the confirmation I think it was forty seven to forty a and and Democrats are showing an advantage now when it comes to the generic polls the generic congressional poll almost ten percent at this point so it it looks like the Democrats may be able to ... hoping they can sustain\nAre good for us all into him and it certainly is like the memory of a nap spread to live or do I go by news cycle and that's happened to the voters and to the media really as well and so if you look at the twenty sixth election\nThe Access Hollywood tape have a three week sounds weird but and bill is Trump's low up it was only three weeks later that he was able to recover because of the other venues that happens so there's still a lot of the capital\nTo wear a leather Katie this president is seeming to turn to listen Democrats right at a at a rally in Iowa this week he stood out at any accused him of the same things that they have leveled against him which is basically saying they're practicing quote the politics of anger division and destruction\nDo you think that is gaining enough traction to slow down the elements how much his Democrats that that Carla had alluded to\nWell at that same rally they lead chance of their chance of lock her up referring to Senator Dianne Feinstein girl and the Kavanaugh from age I don't\nI think you know yes certainly there are voters out there uh you know Trump space that are angry but I think you can't underestimate as Karl was saying um the anger on the other side particularly among women I ... I cannot tell you how many women I Know just in my own personal life\nWho were saying that they were surprised just by the emotions that that hearing brought up for them you know I Know people who said they're not going to watch it because they just can't deal with it and I think a lot of women are taking that anger and are determined\nTo show their voice at the polls I'm as we've been seen since the presidential election actually I'm In\nTerms of trying to catch us in a way as kind of a me to versus white men in and said it was a scary moment for white men I think that is an issue that he's brought up in some of these rallies I think by referring to some of the uh women's groups has mobs a\nWacko and those are the kinds of phrases we've heard out of Trump this week\nUh that that will only serve to energize more women voters I've seen it out there and even in here in California with some of these congressional races that's going to be a critical vote\nAnd some Democrats are saying they want to turn up the heat right we have this week former attorney general Eric Holder came out and said in reference to the Republicans when they go low we kick them\nA Hillary Clinton came out and said that you can't be civil with the current Republican Party so it seems that there are now taking a page from President Trump's playbook getting a lot more aggressive will that play out well I'm\nWondering if voters are going to just say you know a pox on all their houses there they're already getting tired of this back and forth on this nastiness\nAnd those are the kinds of phrases we've heard out of Trump this week uh that that will only served to energize more women voters I've seen it out there and even in here in California with some of these congressional races that's going

a lot more aggressive will that play out well I'm Wondering if voters are\nGoing to just say you know a pox on all their houses there they're already getting tired of this back and forth on this nastiness I at some point some candidate is going to be\nSmart enough I think to to offer some other kind of a ... agenda here that has less to do with a beating each other up and more to do with actual policy when it comes to issues like\nHealth care I mean this is the number one issue for people out there right now uh they're not talking about me to they're not talking about Russia um they're the they're really interested in health care and I was in an economic issues those are still the big\nOne I think ... a raises a good point and some of the congressional races that I've been covering for instance I'm\nA congressional that California fourth district which is north of Sacramento a Republican Tom McClintock is being faced by a challenger or a woman Jessica Morse now that race is still likely his you know she has a big hill to climb but I just monitored and there is a debate between the two of them and\nThe issues there are like local you know how are we going to manage our forest you know we've been in the Sierra districts they don't want to burn down and things like that those are the issues I think that voters\nAt the end of the day really care about because that's what most closely affects\nTheir lives and are you seeing that across the border because I Know that you have been doing a series of reports on ... on the record number of women running for office this year in California how many are running for Congress or in California\nThere are I'm not sure exactly how many specifically in California I think the number of total there was about four hundred women that had\nUm ... ran for Congress and I think about two hundred something made it past the primaries um so it's a large number and the national now that is a nationally and then you know that does not include like legislature and then like water boarding school boards things like that\nUm I Know there are there some common themes to why they're running and what issues the writing on\nWell I think there are a lot of women who are running because of twenty sixteen I mean when you look at it it largely is a democratic women story they are fired up and they want to sort of take back the country as they see it um but\nThen when you talk to them again a lot of the themes that they're going on I really will fall yeah I mean I talked\nTo so many women out there who say the women's march I mean that's the twenty sixteen election but that was the first time they get they got involved or many of those women who are involved and house races in Southern California those critical races were energized\nBy college educated women story food at a higher suburban women's ... remains to be seen whether this energy exists in these kind of blue collar district that were traditionally democratic union districts that flipped for Trump and whether the same cultural effects is happening marriage or singing in suburban California\nThere are some she'll pay women running for the first time as well I'm In congressional races we have young can and Diane Harkey in orange county have they been able to galvanize Republican women the same way that democratic women running I have to do on their side\nEnergy is certainly not on the Republican frontrunner comfortable wearing a massive gender gap I Do think though that uh uh women candidates in primaries in Republican primaries dude well because Republican voters\nDon't like this you know for a conversation where success deal and they want to prove that they're not ... boosted a women candidates in Russia primaries young comes in a circle\nAnd Molly Turner and urban innovation lecture at\nUC Berkeley high school if business welcome to both things are going to so many people who live and work in San Francisco and many people visit sale that homelessness is one of the biggest problems right now in San Francisco so what kinds of taxes with proposition C impose on big businesses and how would that money being spent\nRight so this is a tax on money companies are bringing over fifty million dollars so you know right away this was on the biggest companies in the city you know a few hundred companies um and it's raising their grocery sheets tax so for most companies say see this by you know about a half percent increase in that\nUm and really directed towards entirely a addressing the homeless situation that we have here in San Francisco about half towards housing so you know rental subsidies actually building housing the other half towards more immediate thing shelters navigation centers mental health treatment\nAnd I think what you're seeing for from supporters of this is a knowledge was that these companies have done incredibly well in recent years we all agree homelessness is that is probably the top issue in the city it's time to look at these companies are as a place to find a solution that you mentioned mark venue off and\nComing out and supportive as he put it as basically a binary choice if you're with the homeless you're with proposition the\n[laughter] the ... and the measure was put on the ballot by home with advocacy groups but\nYou know despite the fact that it would put a lot of money into the city's coffers yeah mayor Lyndon breeds stepping out in opposing it and you have some state lawmakers David chew and Scott Wiener opposing it why are they not backing this measure\nRight I mean they'd argue is not buying area and you know before he we invest in double the amount of money the city of spending on homelessness we should take a look at how the current money's being spent you know a one and breathe in her minister Haitian wants to figure out an audit process to to figure out where the money is going\nAnd so that's the policy aspect of it there's also the politics of it I think if proposition C passes a couple of years from now voters are going to judge this result\nOn mayor breed and and and how her ministers and is able to spend that money is not on homeless advocates so from the perspective of of one breed she wasn't at the table crafting this measure she didn't you know put it on the ballot but she's going to be accountable ultimately for whether this homeless crisis\nCuts or she's not invested in it I'm Molly Turner ... ... what is your take on prop see what all this money three hundred million dollars and make a big difference\nSo it would almost double the budget that the city uh currently has to spend on homeless services so we have a significant impact on and the city economist recently issued a report\nSaying as much a she also said that it might have a small but significant impact\nOn jobs and on the city's GDP estimating out their point one percent of jobs in the city could be lost from this five big businesses deciding to move outside of San Francisco because of the increased tax rate but it's really hard to know what the impact of\nReducing our homelessness crisis on the streets wouldn't be on business and US Airways has got in the city and we've already seen for example that some conventions are pulling out of this city citing homelessness crisis as the reason so it's a difficult thing to why\nDo we even know do this a city even have a good handle on how the money that it is currently spending is being staff because San Francisco's homeless population has pretty much stayed the same it's light hundreds of millions and millions of dollars poured into it over the past decade is you know hovered around seven thousand or so every year\nThrough the budgeting process the city has allocated funding to the recently forums department of a whole assessment supportive housing\nOr to know what the impact of reducing our homelessness crisis on the streets would be on business and the San Francisco in the city we've already seen for example that some conventions are pulling out of the city citing homelessness crisis as the reason so it's a difficult thing to why\nDo we even know do this a city even have a good handle on how the money that it is currently spending is being spent because San Francisco's homeless population has pretty much stayed the same it's by hundreds of millions and millions of dollars poured into it over the past decade is you know hovered around seven thousand or so every year\nSo through the budgeting process the city has allocated funding to the recently forms department of homelessness and supportive housing over the past several years to the city has a good sense of how much it's spending however\nI Believe that the mayor's referring to the newly installed one system which is a database that essentially track\nHow each individual in being funneled through the system of variety of services and how much money is being spent on each individual and once that system is up and running that said it could have a much better sense of exactly how much is being spent on what kinds of services for what and demographics of the very diverse homeless population\nBut I mean we can agree it's an ongoing struggle I mean the way we even figure out who is homeless in the city is by sending volunteers all every two years to do kind of a point in time not really twenty first century approach but you know again but the the real issue is can you track from when you find someone who is homeless to really tracking how the services they're getting it how those services are doing\nAnd other communities that are doing a good job of that I Know that you did a very comprehensive report on homelessness a for ... for the San Francisco bay area planning an urban research association where you looked at homelessness in the entire region are there are communities that are showing some success and how they tackled this problem\nCertainly in the south bay in Santa Clara county they actually created this system which is called a coordinated entry system which is what San Francisco called the one system to better track\nSpending on homeless services um they created that a couple of years ago and already that showing some results and helping to measure the impact of their spending um further south in the state um Los Angeles\nI'm past the measure um last year increasing exponentially the amount that the city and county funds homeless services and there's a lot of hope\nUm that that's going to result in us a extreme reduction and whole assassins ... a Los Angeles and and guy\nA San Francisco isn't the only city obviously with a housing and homelessness issues you've covered also on other measures on the November ballot specifically in Mountain View in Palo Alto so they have their own measures that would tax big companies as well to address some of the region speak as problems housing and transportation\nGrowing movement holes companies accountable\nFor the economic inequities that we're seeing\nI think they're absolutely as I think these measures are evidence of that and especially when you look kind of at the trend of how a cities have gotten money for things like housing and transportation it used to be the federal government would be putting money towards you know urban development that's not the case anymore but what is the case is you know corporations\nLast year got a a huge corporate tax reduction from thirty five percent or Twenty one percent so the corporations are are getting back money and I think with the city's in in Mountain View it's Measure P even trying to get direct money towards transportation\nNeeds to all to measure age age which is another affordable housing measure they're really looking at these companies and saying hey you've done very well with with the federal government with tax\nReform it's time to spend some of that money locally\nBut Molly don't some of these cities if they if they're saying that don't they risk alienating companies that are already in the city or discouraging new companies from coming in\nShirt that said the economist report actually found that there is a risk that companies will pick up and leave the city of San Francisco in search of lower tax rates [laughter] but I Would say that San Francisco and the state of California have historically had\nVery high tax rates compared to the rest of the country and that doesn't seem to have to turn businesses from moving here are forming here on the cost of doing business in San Francisco is extremely high taxes aside just the cost of living and transportation for its employees are very high\nAnd so I question the extent to which increased taxes will actually impact location decisions for businesses\nAll right we'll leave it there Molly Turner within UC Berkeley high school of medicine at the end ... thanks to you both thank you\nThat will do it for us as always you can find more of our coverage at ... dot org slash newsroom I'm ... thank you for joining head\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] that's the sound of\nGreek ruined our on our nose in other words you Breyer raised in captivity they have to be trained to hunt where they can be released into the while I'm Jim Michener and this is the pulse of the plan\nMost of the behaviors of birds and other

received an orphan or an injured youngster it is given to foster parents of its own spaces\nA change in the kingdom on a breath of fresh air but actually you don't have to scratch very ball to see that\nHe had been that much of a reform he came here and he ... tech titans ... people in Hollywood and the Saudis loved that but actually\nThey let women drive it was on the front pages of every paper a week before that they looked up a bunch of women activists so\n... I think there's been some skepticism in foreign policy circles about whether this was really the reform Saudi Arabia that policymakers would have hoped it was because it would have made America's relationship so much easier with Saudi Arabia so based on that with cabbage is said how is this going how's this\nPresident going to handle it his his son in law Jared Kushner senior advisor has in many ways embrace the crown prince wanted to see that modern side of Saudi Arabia but\nThe whole world is watching on human rights and other front\nDallas right what would you saw the body language and equipped you showed how ... what was the president doing he was like this right doesn't want to deal with this he doesn't want to get in the middle of two allies turkey and Saudi Arabia doesn't want to mess things up\nOn your wisdom and Saudi Arabia where there was the first place\nHe went to visit outside the United states as president method of the statements ah and he told them specifically we're not going to tell you how to live in other words human rights is not going to be our number one priority even a number three or four or five priority\nNow what is that we've been dealing this for years plenty of presidents have made tradeoffs when it came to Saudi Arabia and downplayed human rights concerns because we knew it was interesting because they are good with us on intelligence and terrorism\nColumnist at the center of this you have someone journalist throughout the middle east you all I'm so glad you're all here you've all reported and lived in the middle east you you understand global politics you've seen it up close what does it mean for journalists as they watched us all\nI mean I can speak for myself I was based in the middle east for twelve years as a reporter and fearing for our lives is not something unusual ... throughout the Arab Spring we're always looking over our shoulders worried that someone could come after us that we would be targeted because of the work we were doing\nHowever this has a totally different dynamic instead of in the sense that this happened on foreign soil\nA in a casual way that we've really never seen before where I'm a junkie essentially just walked into this Saturday conflict and then he allegedly disappeared\nAnd that is what we are dropped grappling with now is just a casual nature of this alleged incident uh and mystery surrounding it where we just don't have the answers yet and no one is really kind of ... and ... and\nOther autocratic regimes are watching the U.S reaction and you know there are plenty of other countries like China that that crack down on the press and they're going to be watching how the world reacts to this case as a guide post for how far they can go to crack down on internal dissent and\nTo some extent it is it this is more than the case of one journalists one man and even will in the case of human rights in this instance that there is\nIt has become the test for American leadership and the Trump era and for the Seventy is America has led the world in a way that was not transactional which of course they did things that were transactional too but there was some sense that America did\nLed by exceptionalism lead by example led by moral values and if the president is only going to put ... if a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of defense contracts that that is a sea change in the way that Americans led the well to the last Seventy is\nLet's turn to another major foreign policy development Nikki Haley US ambassador to the United nations surprised many officials this week which you know she'd be leaving her post at the end of the year\nDuring her tenure the U.S moved embassy to Jerusalem in Israel took a hard aligned with Iran and conducted historic nuclear talks with North Korea and even before reporters asked about her next move Hayley said she was not planning to run for office in twenty twenty but she did have high praise for the president's family\nDina Powell the former deputy national security advisor about out of the process here but what we see with the departure of Haley an establishment Republican at least when he was friendly with establishment Republican traditional hawks talking about those norms catty just mentioned now leaving the administration what does that mean fashion residence\nRationing figure and a lot of ways because she has managed to straddle a really tough line and this administration particular where she has some time to time spoken out in ways that are contrary to the president and yet stayed more or less on his good sized seems like\nA membership third talked about Russia and how is it tough on Russia he didn't do that and she talked about sanctions on Russia that actually undercover at one point on that\nUh but she was never in the doghouse away say Rex Tillerson was a or a strongman master and so forth and the timing and leaving now a few weeks before the election allows it to be on her terms not after election when it might be lumped in together with a poster election bloodbath as if a voting goes badly so she's managed to I think\nA preserves viability within the system to use the phrase\nA and revoke options open door and\nNikki Haley may be one of the few people who is able to leave us administration and the clean way I mean she's at the end of the calendar year for the time for her to leave she's leaving on with high approval ratings she's popular and um she leaves her political ambitions intact now but\nShe also founder so crowded out at times with secretary of state\nPompeo ah yeah now there's a debate going on about whether that will and carry on being a cabinet position and whether the next um American and best of the United nations actually will still have a cabinet post which I suspect this might compare and don't both will be quite happy if it didn't\nYou have both in inside former UN ambassador advising the president maybe this whole institution this whole roll you in a bathroom to pull back well both\nIn general has tried to streamline a and a slide down a centrally uh the the operations around him especially and so this wouldn't be surprised if he wanted to have a someone reporting to him versus a kind of separate element to it\nBut in general Nikki Haley had bad was it was someone that wanted her own voice in the early days of her term as the ambassador and she really spoke out is Peter was saying like a sort of opposite to what the president was doing in a lot of cases\nAnd it really made her stand out and have her own voice she was trying to establish ourself on the international stage she had never really held up in addition like that\nAnd so she kind of check that box with this job and now it seems that she realized that she got that even the\nMen do I get confused said it's been a ran over to somebody pushing back against the White House in public and survive that's right\nAnd if she does want to want to run for president some day she has his foreign policy experience to address domestic\nAnd those who are talking about his replacement of people who don't have her independence stature people who would be there for more support and it was I was only the White House sure\nYeah let's let's shift from foreign policy to the campaign trail President Trump was in Ohio this Friday night that was the fourth campaign event for the president in less than a week Brian wrote this week's time cover story I have it right here that the election will test the strength of President Trump's hold on his party and she'll just how last seen an imprint\nIs unique mix of populism nationalism will make on the Republican Party and America for years to come with just weeks away Brian and he's on the trail he's in Iowa Peter and I were an eerie Pennsylvania with the president this week in a rally tonight in Ohio you can the cabinet nominations stoked is based comeback to twenty sixteen levels\nIn orange county and the Republicans and Donald Trump or are banking on it I'm Donald Trump has really made this midterm without him referendum on him he's embrace that the polling that the Republicans are doing are showing that unlike the thinking a few months ago that tax cuts would be mobilizing but the economy you ... know what they're ...\nGo that tax cuts would be mobilizing but the economy with ... know what they're finding among the Republican base is that talking about Kavanaugh and this'll nomination vast mobilizing the Kavanaugh fight\nAnd talking about Democrats potentially obstructing Donald Trump's objectives and policy decisions going forward if they get to control one branch of the house that also is mobilizing debate so that's why you hear Donald Trump out there\nTalking about Democrats being a mob and ah and using words like obstruction and bringing up to the cabinet ... just off\nThe evening he said that in fact have not actually did a survey for the Republican Party because of the controversy surrounding his nomination as confirmation\nSure he knows that he thought that he did a\nService and that he's mobilized Republicans like never before and and so that is essentially something that he's going to be using in the next couple of weeks to get out there and vote for the mob in his words doesn't come out from but polls tell\nA complicated story when we're in Erie we saw Lou Barletta congressmen running for US Senate against Bob casey in the Keystone State\nOr letters behind Republicans running in Wisconsin for Senate Ohio running behind the Democrat so that you see the enthusiasm at the rallies but polling shows that in the states the president wanted twenty sixty Republicans aren't exactly having an easy time\nWhere you see a disparity in particular between the house and Senate too which is going to be an odd thing for a lot of people to understand if the house were to go democratic and the Senate not only not go Democrat including the ... Republican seats because the way\nThe seats are arranged this year in the Senate races that happened to be more Democrats were vulnerable than there are Republicans\nA but you're right the energy has been for many many months on the Democratic side for president trying to duplicate that on the Republican side but the people go to the polls because they're angry because they want to\nProtest something not because they want to say thank you write a microwave policy thank you Mr President for getting us Brett Kavanaugh they would go to the polls say hey we don't like Brett Kavanaugh we're going to go and protest he's trying to get them to look at this as a protest or by against the mob mob and it's hard to see if you can maintain that kind of anger for that many weeks or something you actually want about anyone\nI guess how long it's three and a half weeks in American politics\nIn a year and then ran a drawing for me and a half weeks ago but I'm sure it's something we want to remember what happened three and a half hours yeah\nSo that's what the Democrats a bank account you take some time McCaskill joined the whole cabinet crisis and a confirmation process for her a crisis approval ratings among independents went from plots tend to plus full\nI still just a couple of days ago she said that even off to Kevin I was concerned she already started seeing and pick up again and it was stabilizing so Democrats are desperately hoping that three and a half weeks is a long time and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "13"}
