Rosa Parks and they became my mentor that I never met I used to talk to them that critically\nSo in two thousand and four Kenny created shelf guy and he started pretty small actually as a football team but it grew and grew he married an American volunteers who came to work on the project which now includes a school for girls a youth mentoring scheme and health clinic and it was a clinic that inspired that focus on water\nWe used to tell people what to believe in you know a clinic to get some people get paid for it so you have to rethink some guys what do we do\nSomeone at the committee had a suggestion and I'd be a kid like you know what what is the opposite of fluids and bike on the ground\nTo air [laughter] ... [laughter]\nI don't know where the topic will be played no see which\nWhen it's dropping you see what his ... and I'm like wow this is a good idea if I did we just don't believe in somebody to commute you we just sat there and you're like whoa direct let me think about it for let's get the pie in the end of it yeah\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that hurt trait in a big way ... experience and status in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWhere we the people I mean it just doesn't work if you love them because I live in now have you had any interaction with them yes I don't mean to me that they started cutting the pipes at Fox they started cutting you'll pipes yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them will be agree on I took my wife's or their children\nTo be the ones that didn't want to you know I chose so I was in combat is why we're able to survive than there is a daily out so well by that is that some times that they send their water we dump sand mostly on the weekends we don't do send water\nFor that day they said the water there this is Kenny\nOld over he has a running with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWith ... for two she lives and\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by FHM presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the patron or freedom theater FHM at ... dot com\nYeah yeah so I Will find a way to walk with them for the week without too you know to put the impact of the system so that's your what's your next [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nJust listening to Kenny how his life story the sun makes me realize that she really is the key to this\nSolution here and we sell all within our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happen and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he street smart he's slum smart if you'd like he knows how to operate the\nYeah I don't want to paint shelf though as a one man band Kenny just off on his own doing this in Kibera it's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that call school like I mentioned the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny run states together with his wife\nAnd for those that was that they do that very well rewarded\nHe makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit less still a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that to ... they said the salaries in line with organizations if a similar size or everything's been signed up by the ...\nAre paying for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment\nWell they're bringing in a lot of money shelf go just want to two million dollar prize from the Hilton foundation a hotel room yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with older the what the shelf that does not just the war but there are other projects to buy the only ones who are trying to solve this problem ... not the only game in town\nThere are lots of different people and open I say shouldn't thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums\nAnd just in Kibera a United the country they all said and I'm thinking one woman she said and Wonder Woman with ... she was a gladiator a few years back if you remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that also dreading bullet holes that pumping water out right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just bouncing up and passing it out so they got the walk through the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime but then illegally at night so it's a complicated picture\n... a lot of different players involved I decided to how to surf go into the\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this ... whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way and he said that ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in the slum itself\nSo that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that come with some people like short Cohen Kenya a bit more sweet to ... you know fast doing things on the ground they know how it works\nYeah exactly and that is the whole point of ... their grassroots organization that led by the parents as folk barons\nThey didn't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental it's been but he said he had invisible Mentos\n... mountain that I must be Rosa Parks they just how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nMen and women who don't just sit down and watch when prince on what's happening and what they did they organized people transform their own life they didn't sit down and which plants and now that's not the answer for that to be a year come together [noise] you know\n\n\n[noise]\nThank you for that for you and thank you well tax listeners for well listening we hope you can she didn't again next week when will introduce you to another problem solver from

understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nIt's about how science developed and how it to find a space within the culture and I'm within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy is understood and the seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of ... it wasn't necessarily particularly well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to economies or to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing its own oath already\nI'm One of the ways to do that has often been to exclude women because women was seen as perhaps being\nMore dangerous or less serious or less intelligent because of the way that gender roles of being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being excluded why they may want to touch and I'll tell him to\nTake because that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding women legit moral authority\nAbsolutely ... once you get to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public says so women not generally left in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so that as a muscular and kind of ... ... is going on and on owning a living and so and\nSo when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments we was talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when

being excluded from those of Chaney and historical examples\nIf we look for who is actually pay to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places like that happens so the role of searching granted she's one of those places where you might end up living by doing scientific work\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing at you know ... which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding minds exploiting resources and not kind of thing but you're not finding people doing scientific research within universities for example so yeah it's really only like sure on that you get the kinds of scientific Korea that we would understand that if someone says she paid to do ... particular problem\nIs is pretty much across the ... the case or is it or are you talking specifically about Europe\nI'm ... I'm very much talking about the western European tradition and water will say get sort of taken up in in America older I'm interested in you they're all more opportunities for women in what is a very new university system in say the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach astronomy in women's college so I was in the U.S and they are in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system\nAnd often novelty gifts brings the women I mean probably often it's a sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps\nSo we do find women there and the way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in Britain you felt talks with in Cambridge in England and women's struggling for very long time to be given places seem\nTo think you said that when a field is new\nAnd it coincides with the developmental ... women and an education\nThen you do see more women entering those field I think I could like interesting that in when you look at the desk of figures on women in science for example there's some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela those kinds of fish and worst of the lowest\nAre the Netherlands surprisingly enough I'd love to know more about the ... and what kind of rolls and you know are we talking about private companies doing such or I'll be talking about university systems\nYou know what is the kind of funding that goes into research with any investigation there's different countries so in some cases I suspect that may be longer if I could sum are women being at higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded\nAnd way there are places that aren't very well funded or not seen as being particularly ... then you tend to find\nWomen finding an opportunity because men are not taking off because there are other things that they would rather be doing and certainly we find that in different scientific fields where a field is no full say they're a good example and the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so a new kind of way of doing astronomy\nWomen over from being quite early pioneers in those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing down\nFollowing the traditional education system they own competing with a lot of established individuals usually male who publishing in those areas and some interesting they we sometimes find that that gives\nWomen an opportunity until then often to start paying that then push that so far a typical an iconic exemplify says computer programming which early on was very much seen as a\nFemale role we sort of associated with lots of fake as punch cards and things that were often seen as almost secretarial work and I'm In the very narrowly retiree euro so you know it wasn't necessarily well paid\nAnd often it was left to women today this but when it was under ... teaching was going to be\nWe find that it stopped being paid market seems Bayh we'll stitches and women have them being similarly shut that down [laughter]\nBeans similarly shoved down Rebecca he get lecture and history of science at the university\nOf Penn and just how much wouldn't get filtered out was home by surveying the u._k. a few years ago they found that two thirds of the British public\nWas unable to name a single famous female scientist to end this program which compiled views of women working in stem subjects and asked them to name that style female scientist you'll hear in a pig every time a name is mentioned [noise]\n\nMy ... a lot of structural engineer and my engineering heroes and ... have to take charge of delivering the Brooklyn Bridge after his father in law died in an accident on site and her husband was really getting injured [noise] she goes I\n\n[noise] but\nLived in my age [noise]\nThey did find [noise] astronaut news around him stay\nMy name is Katie experiment is saying we want to get a very tough times that they can do to get the fundamental building blocks of each other [noise]\nI'd like to nominate stuck to somebody else you know she used to be such a scam and did you say the females or general\nI Am just from from the [noise] I like to highlight kids' day in court [noise] like sharing name we'll have shared Asher and kind of a high rate she was from an African about price [noise] medicine for sure [noise]\nLots of things that some names to remember the next time we're off to to name a stop female scientist that sent from this business daily Monday can always get in touch with the program you can send your comments to our Twitter handles BBC business or at BBC World ... ... to to handle\nA man went on BBC does this daily it's back again at the same time tomorrow [noise]", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "09"}
