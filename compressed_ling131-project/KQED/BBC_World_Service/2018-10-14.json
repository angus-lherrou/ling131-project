E. D. F. M. San Francisco Kaye queuing I FM north Thailand Sacramento the time now is nine PM\nRemember in the news was boring politics is boring that happened right\nI'm not a magic number that you were there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing that was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively\nReading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the members we've had these last few years\nWere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions and\nTo me this one feels the worst [noise] I think\nBecause the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so why don't like it was so many hours\nAnd then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong that even watching it was emotional it was a steady [noise] and then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting\nFor the FBI report which held us off or a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelief that the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one\nThere are people who haven't picked aside an incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today\nAnd I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding\nOn a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise] those those people having to make these huge decisions they are not comfortable with all [noise] W ... Chicago just American Life America stay with us [laughter]\n[noise] but [noise] judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill the last week turn of the TV and you to your tortured face\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over undecided than to make it now on Kavanaugh was yes it was let's wait a week ... made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a guest again\nIs is that we choose to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill would you agree with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices\nThere's always the first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [laughter]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise]\nJust staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nYou just pick me up for an interview\nJust late fees can be a little deceiving she looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside is just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get the elevator to get to the boat and now he was\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation from one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country\nFlick and declared that he will be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\nArcade I was one of the two women and not confrontational play than mourning mourning when that elevator dorm close to where Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential there were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAnd on line said support the heroes who convinced flake read over thirty thousand dollars and the ... people loved his version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks\nAnd then people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nEnded the women in the same way you this morning and they saw him I\nAlso we talked about it wasn't safe they say it was I was\nSaying it's not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal

she's not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I see him confronted by protesters over the healthcare bell the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before flaking I'd gotten an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham before women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero to usher and I believe winning tee shirts they were filming hand and calling out do you believe women Senator Flake\nEasily heartland we support what do you know one way for me when you when you\nThink you have to see something you can say the winning right now in the survivor\nGlad we're having this hearing today\nDid it affect you and people like that [noise]\nBenefit severe ...\nSleek making fun of himself we talked about this for for like lots of men his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators\nTrying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today\nAnd and just have a little humility on that front ...\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nToday after the for Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found foreign credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't as off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a vote 'em\nIt's been it's just\nA debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw [laughter] you know [noise]\nWell next morning of course freak finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do and they say in it and you've got to come back to\nThursday the FBI releases the report that he called for on friday week announced his decision he's a yes on Kavanaugh I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nIt looked Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I have not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report with a disgrace to basically didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car\nPeople are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI before\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk

a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has that changed since he went through\nWell I like my own ... uh\nYou know remember the\nSenate is a political party and they have to act
