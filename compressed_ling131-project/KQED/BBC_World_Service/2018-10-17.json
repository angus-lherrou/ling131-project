I wouldn't even say it on television for quite a vulgar comment about this I thought were going to fire here and that's like comments requires but also understanding that the u._k. is leaving not the new bike\nEnglish sucking now so much energy from the European Union everybody's been raining on to say they're a much bigger dangerous and challenges facing the you and for you as a\nAs an official with with I saw the movie it was vice president of the European and not on a ... a different that's fair enough you know what role is vice president the European Parliament how worried are you by the fact that image of all this fuss about ... what we don't seem to be focused on a certain countries in the light coated in Hungary legs are simply\nRefusing to play by the use rules and accept\nBasic in your values when it comes to things like a free media and independence to the Jews issue and I think\nWe all should be worried about that of course we're all concerned about it that's why I voted that there should be a ... a review of what's going on in hospitals ...\nMotives doesn't doesn't work because not only opponent and hungry for themselves but they are acting with the support of a block of countries have articles that would allow them to be disciplined by the ... commission and the ISI Jay and others it won't work\nI Know but I've ... I've met picked or been face to face and I've said to him my concern about what's going on in his contract at so bill under no illusions that white breakfast is a big issue where also dealing with those other fundamentalist I'd want a portion they at least within the European Union you have the capacity to insulin\nTo bring out to go seven what you're saying is not going to work\nWell they

to make sure that the polish leadership understands that the root of a half to ... even if that takes longer than I Would like that we keep demanding high standards and the the benefits of Europe is that at least these countries are with us around the table but it doesn't take away core point there aren't deep division\nAnd now they're now the division it also seems to me that the the the the strain of needs to be nationalist populist populist politicians which would include those in governing in Poland and Hungary are making the political whether an policies like yours\nSponsorship of the

Europe who refused to accept the\nNotion of burden sharing when it comes to taking ... off immigrants on a whole host of other issues including the creation of a new security force putting ten thousand gone into from Texas east Europeans won by it so all of these issues when it comes to that issue of migration do notion of collective you action just not happening\nNot yes but the pressure would have to be in that direction because for one simple fact the biggest driver of migration flows would not be conflict but it would be time of change and Europe needs to do more on the the reason why is highly on those who've been at the forefront of receiving migrants are angry and say Europe has a ... and then\nThe herd pointed at the numbers of migrants coming to Europe has dramatically decreased but what very worrying if any concern about human beings is that one in a scene die so what are you seeing the rise of one person dies has died in the first couple of months of this year

the grains that actually was a surprise\nIf you like the gas and and there are music is coming on Wednesday you should watch out for them but the murder across Europe definitely\nPolitics as polarizing I chair the European Parliament and increasing it when I called vote you see that the extremes on the right and left invoke the same way on issues so it's not just about ideology here there's something else happening in ... in the body politic I mean I Would worry about whether the central can hold or seen the Social Democrats quite fractured\nAre only ... the Christian Democrats that could be quite an action\nBut are you to the the the mainstream blow yeah E. pi paying the European socialist and many people are holding sleeping you belong to me but according to opinion polls

frankly it becomes a bit tedious I may I may have aged since I got elected but I'm not tired\nTo look for in my ... am don't actually want to happen in Hungary and told them this is reality I don't I Know all\nOf that is reality but my job is not to give in to a reality that I Believe would be bad for my children and I have four of them and in fact I warn them\nI say to them you have taken for granted pace on this continent because they're nothing is a given my biggest worry and I do trend that are within sometimes is that we will wonder what the European Union\nGood which was developed peace and prosperity on the continent of Europe for that idea\nThat you can have your own individual policy or you can be a populist when when you have to do is say something but not take the responsibility for us I take responsibility for what I Do and what I say and I hope that in the European Parliament elections we talk about your unlock nationalist just because they tend to be a button\nAnd I appreciate your historical perspective but here's a quote from a man widely respected around Europe Pasco lamb and former commission without change and reform\nThe eating you will remain as it is today in his view it relevant to a majority of its citizens that it was an extraordinarily worrying coming from uh Europe file\nYeah it is worrying I mean you could wear yourself to death to do something with us I mean the first part where he sang reform and he's of course that's essential I mean the thing about being a rather than just hold on a second\nIn art and for example many of us took for granted the single market customs and without understanding was meant for breakfast\nRight across Europe because of the debate people are beginning to understand the single market the customs

you're thinking of the right people and then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you know the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London or Paris\nIf you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft\nAnd the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that very goes developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually a new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types then grows\nWe took about taxes I think the tax is going to be picking me up from I'm In my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think is the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on there you you might have been also they have ... regulations that perhaps the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the self Palo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on tops of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something the theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting in and I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now from those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic\nHow soon are we going to see this resolution you're describing\nSo I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by sitting there saying but I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus in less like a taxi you're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you started to deliver this rap and transportation option and then it just starts to grow from there\nAnd a bunch of ... to go arrow hair on business days and the BBC\nThat really for the new tax will be when these flying drones become\nNot just a novelty placing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are viable option for ordinary people that you will meet well some Seventy or eighty stocks opposite battling to develop the hard way I'm ride sharing tech them ...\n... is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in law being Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job and galvanizing the industry employing everybody together to go after the common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which allow it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things in simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but is this going to start in Europe in America who isn't going to start somewhere else about half the regulatory hurdles so that's how I\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's a water bottle bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it just a natural fit\nYou know a lot of islands to jump out of the ... less dangerous for that reason because when you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight you over the water most and say but you know if you look around the world a lot of the a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\nSays it's hyping top pilots flying taxis or number of western cities Los Angeles ... New York or Paris as soon as twenty twenty five but he's not actually unrealistic shut you give them\nElse where about half the regulatory hurdles so that's how I\nYeah I think ... probably the number one city in my estimation is is uncle right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it just a natural fit\nYou know a lot of Iowans to jump over about ... less dangerous for that reason because you're not going to crush onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight you over the water most into it but you know if you look around the world a lot of a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\n... besides it's hyping pilots flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas New York or Paris as soon as twenty twenty five but it's not actually unrealistic shut you give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to overcome professor Steve right from the university the west of England\nWill listen to worry first time we have an accident which can be attributed to machine as you can imagine people kind of lose their mind to face\nAnd say we're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon as a real worry and that's providing pulls facility for the rest of the industry back in the seventies I think they used to be\nA helicopter taxi service operating around New York and then I flipped over and killed ... people and\nThey're not really done it since have day oh what's the Pan Am building wasn't the weather's a helicopter crash that that was cool like us and say again we have problems in developing these technologies but\nOddly enough this is one area in which the technology actually solve the problem we've had in the past I think the the ... that will pay an easing in period way the public needs to get used to the idea\nTo just in the same way that we had the the the person walking in front of the car waving a red flag whether that's whether that's I ever actually happened that day that was the early days of ... days it makes it makes the vehicles exactly we a if a if a law\nAnd we need to get used to ideas and so once said to be Paul solve our everyday lives\nAnd this is what's possible with this new technology people will accept it how long will it be how long will it take to we get to some kind of drugs and drug ...\nC I but I Would love to say I mean this is this is the question everybody asks me much particular ... timescales is ten to Fifteen Years\nNow the thing is I Love to be proved wrong in this case because I really well by flying a\nA really well much lying taxi but the number of hoops we've got two and should jump through as well in order to make sure this equipment is demonstrably say now will take time in the in the sense that we read and just now deciding which we do need to jump through", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
