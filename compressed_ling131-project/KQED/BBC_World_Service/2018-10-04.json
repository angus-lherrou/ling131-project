U. dot org and we had been hearing from so many of you want to listeners primarily women\nBut not exclusively Patrick emailed to say I am so tired of people equating my anger with the insanity\nFriends laugh at my posted insinuate that I've lost it and you know what I have I have lost my inability to be quiet in the face of gross injustice\nAnd Joan emailed us I'm sixty five and I was in college with the first feminist resurgence is the world the usa ready for women's anger that's like asking African Americans when will the world be ready for their anger the answer never\nPower doesn't see without a fight don't even ask the question the question itself\nIs demanding and peg in Traverse City emailed this on a conservative woman that is angry that someone could be assumed guilty based on unproven allegations I'm angry at the assumption that all American women are anti Kavanaugh pro choice liberal and progressive\nI'm a proud American woman who's also conservative pro life pro Cavanaugh I Am an American woman\nTo now Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme and how this story fits into the moment\n[noise] a shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many\nThe story fits into the moment [noise]\nA shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry is to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life\nBecause I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institution\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman thought and be a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that\nMy anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job or showing up offering quality lectures are material\nOr material but then it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is to acknowledge that we have the right to outrage and some reject ideas that said that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way make irrational or makes our claim it legitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it mean that we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see 'em\nAnd more women need to give themselves permission to do that I've given myself permission to do that on it in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for\nUs to change that very scary our trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about or we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for being able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room a and the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have written onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment\nThat American shared within the last couple of weeks Serena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresh my memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh from Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America a ... is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her\n[noise] uh yes I I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Britain I can I have been talking about it\nWas interesting because there are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the U. S. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct sponsors of the responses to the people that really just wanted to see her and isolation\nActing um at this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics and the moment and the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been\nUnexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it as\nA athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political live\nThere were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova was response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said martini speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards but Serino was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing just because men regional empires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should\nNot emulated white I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong\nOr she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it at the moment of solidarity\nShe tried police arena conduct I'm as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am living but Martina Navratilova reminded me that until this moment most white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters\nDo when I watch tennis with my friends were African American and its fan we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women who were often knocking at the

aren't odds were like sitting in for Joshua Johnson we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America where I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the ... author of good and bad\nIn the current moment in America where I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and caught author of good in mad Britney Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage\nAnd also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book rage becomes her\nNow I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton into twenty sixteen campaign and I don't want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being very careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America\nAnd in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lotta people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry [noise] the tone of the campaign became [noise]\nNot\nYour fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion\nSays I regret how nasty the campaign became um ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's watching here in the studio with me but how does that strike you know she was ... she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um it was\nRidiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard\nOf careful control in her voice and her facial parents and her body\nAnd her mode of expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they can pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill and channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration\nAnd we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex at a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile as if it was like some catch cholera on the street smile more um she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in her own\nMemoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her and how menacing an aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but does she was thinking\nNo no no that's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us about\nHow much energy women expand\nModulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expression\nNow I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras and all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britney Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in a in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many want listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Erin I'm calling in Lancaster, Pennsylvania Farrah from Cincinnati\nWhen I let my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it it really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting when yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable men don't seem to have that same problem\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts offering a part time graduate course of study

I'm turning my anger into action given help but feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that's what when that happens you have to take that anger hold onto it and that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a theme there are transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industries taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on\nMy determination to be a voice for all and the focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracy is one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation a Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect I'm a\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing a that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a tidal wave in twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by\nUh the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the first black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state um the practically campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that\nSince twenty sixteen we had a wave of\nA progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but we're particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have that channeling our anger\nOn for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment\nBut to your earlier point about whether or not our anger can be sustained on I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes ebbs and flows that's really been a solid political project\nSince ah depending on how you count eight thirty one or Eighteen forty eight\nSo we're we're two hundred years in all those here and so I think you know I'm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think that as women see that um our
