one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down patriots won the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that first please\nA sure anyone an officer when we were ever okay when we were half a mile from home in Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi you set up in your seat ... kept both hands on women look straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland I D and touch my red black and green African medallion into my public enemy T shirt you told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer knelt down and lifting your window when I saw your face or close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits\nOfficer asked why we had in Mississippi license plates because we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park have I done anything wrong officer when officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip\nOn the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so our signal and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face if he asked for your license in registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came off the steering wheel and you pointed at officers face move away from my car you said that is much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may not have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contraction officer asked both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said last time we have done nothing wrong\nMy fist were bald up and I was inching toward the driver's side window you slapped me across my chest with the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and ... right as another officer pulled up\nThe first officer who is now laughing walked back to the second officers car you eventually showed a second officer you license and your University of Maryland id\nOfficer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night never give them a chance to take a shot you finally said\nAfter we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their\nAnd say you kill yourself I hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why don't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't invade instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us use and we wouldn't I told you that fool matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking\nYou might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English save you though\nI Do not need saving you said I Am not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble good\nSees what a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble good you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't while I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people who are allowed to walk around and threatening us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style or fly\nOther eggs or for heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the sentence since from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crux of a lot of uh the relationship or talk about in this book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school and eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd um if you my best friends from a previous school were there and when my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning\nWhen we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put the knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying the Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what you're not giving them a chance to look like\nEat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out a library without checking it out and that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom had you know you can duck them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to the home life\nWhen you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to ask you miss section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you are trying to understand and how did that affect your relationship with her\nYeah one one way I think a lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were right some things that were wrong\nUm she started to be a a a lot more active\nIn trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about was like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different that relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that fighting that protection she saw me and relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself well
