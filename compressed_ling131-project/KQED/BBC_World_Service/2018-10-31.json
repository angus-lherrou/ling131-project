who often times are very concerned about the changing character of their societies but you know they don't appreciate that some degree the character of these societies are already changing regardless of what happens VW migration so I think that there's a lot of confusion in the debate because of that\nWas you'll sit fish will then\nMy answer is pretty straightforward my answer is that if you're thinking about the coming decades we're going to face major challenges of off shoring automation and much else\nWe do need to have somewhat more integration somewhat more cohesion\nIn our market democracies which otherwise risk coming apart at the themes in class terms and many other terms besides and because of that with that in mind we ought to adopt a more integration friendly\nMigration policy one thought is that you're not necessarily going to radically increase the number of a new migrants what you will do is perhaps move towards selecting them on the basis of skills selecting them on the basis of a who will be in a position to help finance but safety net for\nThe various migrants we've absorbed over the last thirty or forty years because that to my mind is the really big challenge it's the second generation challenge how do we ensure that the second generation the children of working class immigrants are properly integrated into our society and are allowed to flourish\nIt kind of changes the whole nature of what America is about though is well doesn't it I mean America is always being about people coming to defuse the American dream being always be in the country what people do go to realize what they call it ...\nWell ... I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy\nWell ... I Would disagree with us for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time with the birth rate in the states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today\nAnd that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely\nImportant part of population change in the states and Europe\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communications\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing\nSector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy then the situation is quite different and it creates a new class\nStratification that entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think\nAbout the story of American immigration is important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ... son on editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of a classic American narrative that's just the panelists immigrant who arrives to seek a new life through hard work and determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history an immigration officer ruled them not to states often described\nAs homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to Trump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of integration and how immigrants who've been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship\nWas restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship and immigration grants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nAnd there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship\nAnd they were not considered immigrants so when we see this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narratives and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens and people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship now after\nThe civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized and the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by her\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a stream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nCertain sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what's happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream and the ... of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the Nineteen twenties centuries\nHave applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at that period of the late Nineteen from the early twentieth century of large European immigration where this oppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity the\nAmerican Dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color the immigrants who are coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority\nOf immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor low educational levels and they are feeling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there's not upward mobility for them\nAs a dean theories and American immigration history when your use these for say an Asian or\nAfrican or a Latin American immigrant with the same as as for European no there haven't even more recent on that doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have\nSucceeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it historically those populations have been permanently marginal\nI'm clear that you're on a different and the political spectrum to run until I'm the editor of the national review the from the other what do you make of his argument\nThat in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment and to allow the current population to adapt to changing economy will needed is a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America is changing to one that's founded on knowledge on\nOn his own knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factoring\nWell that Dan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children making the food growing the food for all of the wealthy people in the service economy it's poor people of color who are providing those services\nProfessor of either Trump ski Salem State University and the case you're wondering yes she is the ...
