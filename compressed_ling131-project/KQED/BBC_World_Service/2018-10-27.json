up being about one\nBig thing to back to bombs mailed the Democrats who have criticized President Trump had been criticized back by the press broken Hillary bronco bombers watch was not a right of way George Soros the legendary Maxine\nWaters [noise] we get\nMost of the vice found in a mailbox hold public officials including former president bronco Obama and Clinton\nWhere a man has been taken into custody in the mail bombing case is just a few days ago the midterm seemed to focus on immigration and that caravan of immigrants making its way to the U.S Mexico border\nOf and you have some very big and before that was the contentious confirmation battle for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nBut through all those twists and turns a lot of important factors have remained constant pi democratic enthusiasm to vote mobile approval rating for the president and a lot of political history indicating Democrats should be poised for big wins in the house\n[laughter] it's just a week and a half to go before election day we're going to step back and take a closer look at the rate for control of the house of representatives\nYou that we have NPR's Dominican much narrow Tim Mak an Danielle Kurtzleben in the studio everybody hey so let's start with the fact that historically and and given to the big picture trends Democrats really do have to wind up their backs let's walk through why exactly that is when\nPresidents are in their first Mitt terms they lose a heck of a lot of seats on average\nIs just as a matter of and we've heard President Trump actually posit publicly why that is\nHow they get complacent [noise]\nIn some of it has to do with frankly with the fact that people got their guy over the line they got their president and then they sort of a back off and the ... perhaps the content in a settled in and the people who are most motivated or the people who are most upset with the policies of the new president is putting in\nPlace fun fact on that show Gallup crunched the numbers a little bit earlier this year and they found that\nWhen the president's approval rating going into the midterms is below fifty percent and Trump's according to our latest costs thirty nine percent the president's party averages a loss of thirty seven seats in the house which by the way Democrats need fewer than that in order to take the house so when the president has approval of over fifty percent\nHis party tends to lose only fourteen states still alive but not nearly as huge\nOne Democrats have been incredibly enthusiastic all year ever since President Trump took office but in recent weeks we've seen Republicans finally getting engaged getting enthusiastic as well\nYeah and as you get closer to the election that tends to happen and Republicans the advantage that they wind up having ... there are couple advantages that Republicans have\nYou know these elections are mostly taking place on Republican turf in the house you know most of these places are at least Republican leaning because Republicans have run up to score when it comes to state legislative chambers and governors' seats which are\nThe ones that control redistricting so a lot of they won so many they're in control correct\nAnd the registration that had been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nYou this has drawn a federal lawsuit a temp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just uh moved to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams end of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as camp likes to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgians economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular race has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning the Georgia flag back in the nineties by the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia for deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbols\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nDominican this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race and it's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell you know Georgia is one of those state that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggests that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of\nThis race my big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal\nBut campaigns done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way but she's just too extreme for George ate\nEven encourage spending caps rating liberal [noise] she's in extreme cases\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with cans and so my big question is you know ... to talk about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe even more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave at that alright Abrams needs to inspire voters in the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand ... he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climate she's going to win this race\nWill have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

are focusing on the falls to try to get a sense of what might happen on election day just about a week from everything\n... showing dealing with a one point lead well within the margin of error\nReal clear politics however has it at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and neck as if the\nRace to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and if you weren't sure already confirmed this this election it's all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only one where when I Do like um otherwise\nYou may now to talk through this NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben hey All right so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans this new poll this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nWell it looks like essentially that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans has kind of faded to be perfectly honest or it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example the vast majority of those races\nAre being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pole and the numbers are Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in A People's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November ...\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nAs a twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around and say that they're motivated to go vote for a Democrat because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican\nSo I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this was about me get trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this was a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking too though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corners Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat or Republican vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gap something is for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump's your vote your fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent man that's a bigger divided and you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make me vote for Democrats thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talked about gender divide and this is important this year\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential this year across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic men and democratic women alike disliked Trump and are going to vote Democrat\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks about independence they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and the gamble here among Republicans and a lot of Republicans I talked to was they said look independents young voters Latinos\nYou know they don't turn out to vote as much in a midterm year so you know if the goal is to drive up the base and this was going to be a base election which is the gamble than they need to fire up the Republican base with a lot of these cultural issues\nAs we read the Democratic party is openly encourage\nAs we read the Democratic party is openly encourage caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to violate laws or\nI had a quick question though I mean when you say this is a base election I mean\nCompared to presidential elections mid term elections are always kind of the reactions right I mean is this year that much difference so the thing is is that is really fascinating I think raises a lot of alarm bells for Republicans\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork of programs let's at least do that\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches us up on some of the stories that we might have missed thank you Ron thank

Detrow\nHere with a special broadcast every weekend Susan mid term election\nAfter all the votes have been tally in each week we focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law in the United states\nIs [noise] this week health care for my first day I'm going to ask us to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare\n[noise] with the Democrat has to be Affordable Care act Republicans found one of their best talking for the used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran\nOn repealing and replacing and we're going to keep our promises\nThat does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThere are Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has failed harsher a tale of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one\nNow to Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care fall election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it that has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this\nWith NPR's Scott Horsley Danielle Kurtzleben guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the health care as their best\nIssue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned fair minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that both\nRepublicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle then Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for affordable festival health care not take it away\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota Denise has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now the ... in touch with Morsi's losses to take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily willing away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ad\nCome down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration Scott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people a book could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with some marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this was sort of\nBeen an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace which despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate bill that didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative selling so voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace spell that bill what has done away with your protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks in an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate\nI don't care about people with pre existing condition\nWay basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nAnd that's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions willing the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year\nI'm a democratic ads yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care and this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks the things here to tell them building Democrats field is here that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nAnd it's the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nTwo of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia\nJosh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying oh I definitely would protect people with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest to rear chronic disease preexisting conditions we know what that's like my job I support forcing insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions\nWell that is a statement that you could argue is very much at odds with the lawsuits that he is a part of to unwind the Affordable CARE Act\nIf you're just joining us You're listening to the politics shell from NPR's Scott Detrow here in the studio with NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben talking about health care so why do you said the basis of all of this a focus on health care I mean do people care more about healthcare now than they did two years ago or four years ago\nOne is that Obamacare is somewhat more popular now than it was back during a lot of the Obama administration and if you look at polling data from say twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen Obamacare was generally seen net unfavorably more people seeing it on favorably unfavorably\nIf it sets cars trucks RVs and mourn whether they're running or not it's\nEasy but the free pick up convenient for you and you get a tax deduction call one eight six six kick you eat the one to three or visit kick you read that or slash cars\nTonight on gay community newsroom Senator Dianne Feinstein says down with us to talk about the Saudi crisis justice have it on and why should be thinking of

election coverage cake and we need politics senior editor Scott Shafer sat down with Diane Feinstein earlier and we want to get full disclosure here Senator Feinstein and her husband are past donors ...\n... thanks for coming in you're so welcome you are asking the voters for another six year term what would you like to do with your time\nWell when I wanted to do is be constructive and be helpful to our state to our nation and California today is either the fifth or sixth largest economic power on earth so I Would like to see that economic power properly delivered to make the world a better place for people\nYou of course the intelligence committee ah you're privy to all kinds of information about things that are happening with our allies with our adversaries I Want to ask you about Saudi Arabia\nBecause of course the the murder parents murder of Jamal to show he has a lot of focus on the attention attention on Saudi Arabia where do you think the u._s. should do with regard to punishing are responding to what what's happened\nWell I can tell you what I Want to I Will not vote for Saudi arms sales\nI'm concerned about how they're conducting the war in Yemen school buses they've hit children they've killed and I'm really surprised that this was enabled by the monarchy to take place and it had to have been that way I think we all know\nEnough of the story now that I Know that this just didn't happen it was planned people were sent to carry it out this is not anyone's way let alone the American way\nSo you don't buy the president's wind that we can't give up this hundred and ten billion dollar on you know\nWhat that's what we stand for we're not a country that revolves around arms sales were a country that we're we're revolves around American values and human rights values and that's what made this country so desirable all over the world it's not arms sales\nIt's what we are as a people\nAnd what we believe and it's our sense of what's right and what's wrong and the ability to fight for right and right now we have a fight for right with Saudi Arabia\nI Want to ask you about the Brett Kavanaugh hearings so you're the ranking Democrat and you did get that letter from Dr Christian was before then you've got some criticism for holding onto it for not giving it to the FBI sooner than you did yes ... um\nI Would probably do it differently\nThe letter in three places said this is confidential when I talk to her\nShe was not in shape to come forward let me let me say that that was my judgment and it was not a short phone call and I agreed to keep it confidential she didn't want\nWhen all changed is when she came forward and then when she agreed to testify and then I gave it to the committee\nIt's a good it's a very hard question Scott took this woman a long time and this testimony was not easy for her\nSo terrible things happen to women and this woman was Fifteen Years old when it happened\nYou have any regrets about the way it was handled\nNo I had to handle it that way and I think I Know how it came out and I learned a lesson there because I Believe came out from another colleague and that was a surprise\nFor college another senator yes can you say that's why I Believe I Know I Would never do that I'm wrong I Want to ask you about your reelection or your eighty five years old\nAnd this week a Joe Biden who I think it's Seventy five or said that if he runs for president twenty twenty stages of relevant issue Bernie Sanders said the same thing I've been to Seventy seven or will be\nSoon do you think it's a relevant issue in this race or\nI mean it's a consideration if people want somebody younger they have somebody younger I really believe\nThat my history has given me certain abilities to do certain things\nAnd if people don't agree with that then vote another way\nMy health is good um I can go in the distance [noise]\nUm I enjoy it and a good part of my life and wrapped around helping people it's just for me\nTheir satisfaction I I can tell you individually\nOr satisfaction I I can tell you the individual stories but it makes my life worthwhile to and then I can give to people\nYou were mayor of San Francisco for years [laughter] and ah\nThere is a measure of San Francisco ballot measure see would tax the wealthiest companies in San Francisco and generate about three hundred fifty million dollars

going to vote for virtually almost any homeless plan I just am because this is my country and this is my city I grew up in San Francisco people were homeless\nA lot of people looked at it well this'll last for five years and it'll pass it hasn't gotten worse\nIt's involved more families more youngsters\nI think it's been about my mouth is right for Thirty years since you've been mayor of San Francisco right yeah and I'm Wondering you know the city now is so different and especially the economy I mean the tech industry is so prevalent now and I'm I'm Wondering what do you see as the upside down the down side of\nThe shell the upside is jobs and the upside is producing a whole new generation owe competitive a workforce based on\nNew instrument\nWhich is technology which didn't exist so Thirty years ago and it's kind of fascinating to watch a history is going to show us whether it's worthwhile or not\nTo me very candid\nI don't see tech as very specifically involved\nAnd I think they

CEOs today or in the tech industry or less receptive to that\nI Can't I I don't understand that to be honest with you\nIt's a much more reserved world sort of a world apart to some extent to meet with

Republican strategist with Wilson Walsh consulting nice to have all of your baggage wonderful to hear\nA lot he work and seeing and she learned more about the pipe bomb scare more about this as fact and many other targets a Democrat summer than the sharpest critics of President Trump a summer now California as we are learning today how is this affecting the tone on Capitol Hill well\nWell you and your in your book you tackle the world that philanthropists who wants to do good Andrew while at the same time we hear all these ... words now a world full of term effect when when I make a difference thought leaders met you say that instead of making the world better they're actually an ailing inequality house so\nThat it's an amazing thing that we we do live in the page or billionaires giving money away in this city right now to billionaires are having an argument about the best way to help homeless people are you a hundred and eighty four people signing the giving pledge and every time you go to the mall there's red iPhone cases are going to change the world the tote bags they don't change the world\nEvery young person I meet on campus hasn't social enterprise idea about converting recycled proven to coffee and telling an Wanda somehow and and yet\nUm for all of that elite generosity an age of elite hoarding\nAt this is the most unequal time in America and hundred years last year the top one percent salaries grew four times faster than the bottom Ninety percent last year eighty two percent of all new wealth created went to the global top one percent to the very same people who talk a lot about giving back\nWho talk here in Silicon valley about disruption and starting companies that are going to save the world those very same people are monopolizing progress in America\nOn the one hand they're arguing for a fix it fix it with in the current broken system as opposed to trying to fix the system totally\nWhen the winners of our age get interested and involved in social change they change change their rarely content to just write a check and supporting organization that they think is doing good work\nThey get involved they get on the board they shake that they shut the narrative the right books about their series of change\nAnd because of who they are that becomes influential so Silicon Valley disruption becomes change higher taxes and that's not change isn't benefit them oh it hurts them and you know a charter school that they can get involved with their name on mentor a few black kids in and say they both that they got them into Stanford that's the kind of change they like\nEqually funded public schools for all which would mean that marine in Palo Alto actually don't get better schools and everybody else that ... that they're not

costs money to implement a battalion women to lean in you can do that for free they like that kind of social\nOf cognitive dissonance then or is there an actual moral laps or evil intent\nTo mix there are I mean I found this wonderful emails from two thousand seven among the Goldman Sachs leadership that was under threat investigation in which they talk about um bad New York times story coming at them that's about their role in the mortgage debacle and they say in the email hey we got to try to pitch this reporter\nOn our GS and gives philanthropy so they understood that a little bit of giving lubricate the engine of continued taking\nBut I think here in Silicon valley it's a different story I think there's a lot of people from ... to Iran mosque to others who are earnest and their desire to make the world a better place and eleven almost messianic faith in their own power to make it better and therefore are totally blind\nTo those situations in which what is good for them actually diverge is from what is good for the world and Facebook is one of those idealistic companies in American history those are the first company in American history to perhaps compromise on to a federal election presidential election there's no accident as far as I see it\nThat these very companies that are so idealistic and talked about making the world better\nBeen so instrumental in building a winner take all economy that works for very few people that\nAre so it's clear and what you're saying is that you don't believe market based philanthropy works so what are you arguing for are you arguing for more government intervention more government spending and and as an extension and higher taxes\nAmong other things um and we should stop being so ashamed of those things um\nAnd we should stop being so ashamed of those things and taxes as the price of civilization and I think rich people in this country probably need to pay\nA lot more than they are paying to to get into line with most of the other rich countries apple has two hundred and eighty five billion dollars offshore while we have\nSeventy four hundred and Ninety nine homeless people here in the city of San Francisco this city of San Francisco where our country to five county area around San Francisco work we're a country and have the ninth highest population of billionaires\nAmong countries and yet it's hard to walk down the street without encountering homeless people\nLet's talk about an issue that's front and center now for the Trump Administration and that is the alleged killing of Saudi journalist tomorrow to show she is put the spotlight on the connection between Saudi money and Silicon Valley how is this illustrate the kind of hypocrisy if you talk about in your book\nI mean I have spent the last few years to report on the phony idealism of rich people and silicon valley's ... epicenter of that but never in my years of reporting that I come up on such a clear example of that ... then the fact that revelation recently that\nBillions of dollars in Saudi Government money has found its way into Silicon Valley and in fact they have become a one of the biggest players out in the valley they own a huge taken over\nIn the dog walking up wide uh indoor dash in that slack where everyone has their boring workshops all day long and and it's hard to think about something that's help quickly here says I'm the illusion\nThat Silicon Valley in anything other than a money making machine but I mean it's horrible it just means that the special ... and his tried to cultivate for its house\nThe notion that it's here to make the world better and the idealism it's sunny this regime and Saudi Arabia is among the worst on earth that money is among the dirtiest on earth is money that was made causing climate change and is used to enforce the degradation of women\nAnd what is in Saudi Arabia essentially a kingdom that is what ISIS ... looks like if it had conquered nation states it is also noted for human rights abuses forty eight beheadings and the first couple of months of this year do you think\nThe tech entrepreneur and executives and recognize it as hypocrisy or to see it as something else\nI mean look if they if they don't reverse course Silicon Valley is going to be known as Riyadh west very soon and that they are so confident in their moral righteousness and the fact that they're making a little better that they cannot detect a incoming information about their hypocrisy\nAnd they're so morally in her via to criticism and the reality is discussion OJ thing has shined a light on frankly a relationship America should have\nChanged a long time ago and I don't mean to put it only on Silicon Valley Washington at the very corrupt relationship with them our weapons companies do city group had a big Saturday steak but Silicon Valley claims it's different\nIf there's a case a moment of reckoning for Silicon Valley up some people starting to question this relationship between what they're trying to do innovate and where they're getting that money from\nA lot of the younger folks who work in these companies also a lot of women who work in these companies people of color workers people who want to start a different take then the you know talk on valley both things are actually coming up with a very different sensibility an a and a real awareness of power in the world that a lot of that founding generation didn't and I think they are going to change these companies for the better\nNow right very interesting on and get us thank you so much for joining us here in his book is the winner take all the meat charade of changing the world ... thank you so much for having me\nAnd that will do it for us as always for more of our coverage

cycle until we were near your twenty four hours or something [noise]\n\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream thanks Sandy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices in the home\nWhat\nMr Trump has not produced evidence of these claims if the administration continues to back him up on these claims just a few days ahead of the midterms well\nNot just to see not provided evidence on these clams but after\nNumber of people in the administration did put their own credibility on the line and back him up he actually told reporters you know what you're right I have no proof that they are but there could be ... in that because the president has realized that fear mongering Indian scare tactics\nDo work in one notable difference is that unlike in twenty sixteen when his own party the Republicans are pretty conflicted over this was a good strategy or not\nYou don't have a lot more Republicans falling in line and part because they saw that the president of one and twenty six tea and um\nAnd that's one key distinction the second thing and it's not just the president's language because he actually is the president and he has the federal bureaucracy at his disposal he can do things like we were going to the Hindu likely next week which is potentially announced that he is inspiring Central Americans from being able to enter the country on\nAnd stopping those asylum claims has echoes of that travel ban that he can actually not just talk about this but he can make it through to give himself and even bigger wedge issue to than\nTo actually point the president untold believes this caravan issue with short handed over the care of them but it's actually a slow moving human tragedy but he believes that this crystallize is among his supporters to pitch that he's making around this particular cultural issue and I asked someone who's familiar with the whole plan I said well how are you so certain that this\nIs by deploying a page of the twenty sixteen playbook that's going to work for you again and just eleven days or so and and the response from the official who was close\nAnd just eleven days or so and and the response from this official who was close to live close to the president also has a hand in his thinking about all is said well it worked for us once before us we're pretty certain is going to work\nYou know Mitt terms or not presidential races as you well know and I you know every time the president goes for a rally or makes all these statements infuriates Democrats see this outpouring of energy on the Democratic side and\nWhat that says I think his push to come in the Democratic politicians to make these very bold statements like he showed that Clinton as Hillary Clinton I was at that event was in Florida aventura actually where the close to where the suspect was a was a ... um was caught\nAnd you know is notable she said there yes we need to calm things down earlier this month she was talking to a Democrat can no longer be civil when someone is trying to ... they believe in the Democratic response to Trump's rhetoric is not to sort of tone things down but really to ratchet things up and that's part of how\nI think we ended up where we are when he was so many threats it's not that surprising that something would in fact become real\nFor Democrats totally engaged by this Republican being rallied by President Trump is also an undercurrent\nOf some real global issues here Josh you Arthur devil's bargain a best selling book but former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and President Trump has been deeply reporting on the rise embrace of nationalism in tough border policy for years and this week Mr Trump publicly signaled his solidarity with those forces\nAs long\nThat wants to do well frankly not caring about our country so much [noise]\nYou know the word is sort of became a Russian national is really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nJosh the president and the administration they're talking about maybe taking an executive action banning asylum seekers coming up from Central America so there is the policy here but also a major thing for the president to state at a political rally I'm a nationalist connecting him with the anti immigrant movements around the world I think\nWhat we're seeing here is Trump trying to seize control of the midterm elections and reframe them around issues in which he's comfortable and he thinks he can set the tone but what is really doing a reviving what I think of as being the pillars of Trump ism right there's there's the aggressive stance toward China\nA there's a protectionist trade policies tariffs but most importantly of all there's the the the nativist anti immigrant sentiment that we've seen Trump a spouse or on Twitter when he's talking about the Margaret caravan\nA and today when he uh deployed troops to the southern border to try and build this and do a big issue it sounds like\nHe's going to give a big speech on immigration next week he may roll out this executive order something along the lines of the travel ban that he did in these early days to try and center the election around this but I think Trump looks at the race looks at the problems that Republicans were having over the summer it was clear that voters were energized Republican voters weren't\nBy the tax cut and many of them were planning to come out to vote I think is Trump's way of of of taking the election and making him about him and hoping that he'll get the same response in twenty Eighteen Republicans will uh but he got in twenty third\nActually is there is also about the president's focus on immigration the president's failure to complete the border wall he promised his base\nIn Chile and then one thing about immigration is that it is an issue that animate Tim it truly is it's not particularly ideological immigration is something even before he became this long shot politician that he wrote about\nThat he talked about that he feels deeply it's a natural issue for him it's one that served him well on the campaign trail and as you point out it's one that he made promises about and he is aware that he they're important to his face and he needs to keep them and it's interesting when I go to Trump rallies and I\nTalked to his ... his supporters there's almost nothing\nThat he will do or say that will shake their faith and confidence in him but one area where they come just the latest that close to criticizing him as saying the west are they really hope that he builds that border wall of course they will then blame Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan for housing and get it done but that is something where they would actually like to see tangible action you're right\nI'm Sorry but it doesn't necessarily effective is that he stepped everything as a binary choice I think it's like the core tenet of in politics and frankly of tribalism if you're either for us you or you're against us we saw that and twenty sixteen we're seeing it now with immigration and with Kevin I think he did a great effects are around the cabinet confirmation\nBut I think you know the problem here is that Trump is not actually on the ballot as much as for how he was like it seems like he really wants to be and who isn't on the ballot is\nThe Mitch McConnell congressional people and the fact that it kind of strange I understand\nThe argument behind training on immigration but it's not actually an area where Congress Republican led Congress has had any achievement so it seems like a natural question that\nVoters would ask maybe not the hardcore Trump supporters but independent or some other like more people who lean Republican like okay well so what did she get done on this and it's hard to see what the answer is\nSuch a smart point reminds me of Josh a story about an orange the poll which showed the tax cuts not working for the Republicans this year they got to do what we used to say\nYeah I mean we we got to us with Bloomberg a couple of weeks ago an internal RMC pole and the big billboard headline there were two messages one was Republicans weren't going to turn out to vote because they believed Donald Trump when he said there was probably going to be a red wave that was\nSpent a ... a Republican strategist and do a ... of of anxiety and truck stop saying that now is trying to rally the base but\nThe other big message was that the Republican tax cut which was supposed to be the central appealing achievement for Republicans wasn't really exciting anybody even within the Republican base and therefore a truck and Republicans are give decided that they need to focus on immigration\n... the other big issue out there and it's not on the front\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream Cindy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nIt's one of the biggest issues for most voters and it's at the center of many of the tight contracts across the country in a Washington Post ABC News poll out this month\nEighty two percent of voters that healthcare is one of the most important issues and right up there with the economy the poll shows a voters' trust Democrats over Republicans on the issue Boehner will Republicans like Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and his race against democratic Tony Evers are now running in support\nSafeguarding insurance coverage for those with preexisting conditions\nWhat an about turn we have for the Republican Party years of running against President Obama's health care law but now they feel like the Democrats have some traction on the pre existing conditions front and they are instead trying to counter running on lowering prescription drug prices Runyon and opioid policy\nRight it's really striking because it turns out the argument that a President Obama and his aides were making all these years which is that once you give people something it's hard to take it away is true but I think this is an issue that has become a little difficult for Democrats Democrats have really put everything on health care is the issue that they had been running on since the beginning of this thing and they felt that they could kind of\nNot even mentioned President Trump because it's so in the ether it's so out there that they can really focus on health care and now that you have all these Republicans promising to protect preexisting conditions even Republicans at our party to the last two that is when we take those benefits away essentially\nMakes it really complicated for voters I think you have to be a fairly educated voters to understand the nuances of this and you know you have these Republicans out there saying that they will protect healthcare and you could see how if he were someone who is predisposed to vote Republican that might sway you\nIs the white us a little nervous about the Democratic emphasis on this issue\nThat but again the White House just stinks at a certain point this all comes back to President Trump's they think of as a referendum on him as he himself has said I'm not on the ballot but pretend I Am pretend you're voting for ... on and privately the president's political advisors have been telling this candidate\nWhether you like it or not you have to own this president um and so they realize health care on some level as an issue um they're generally worried to answer your broader question about the house not the Senate of course but it was a way that is not concern itself particularly in policy prescriptions and that's\nNot wholly where the battle is playing out right now and the", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "27"}
