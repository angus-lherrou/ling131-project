something that deeply upset many people\nAre in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the ... so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life\nUnknown games because our country is not secure\nHe said that of naysayers operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nice enforces all from your own Afghan forces unfold waltz because this is you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Africans we don't\nThis is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from the TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news\nA space for when the sun and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate but\nThis is the transform country whether you look at it\nPhysically or you look at it socially I'm a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along the way they know that your investments in this country has not gone to waste yes we are at war it's not an issue it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and Thanksgiving\nAfghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them but he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now\nIt turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's\nAfghan and why is ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with didn't negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where\nWhere are you and I'll and I'll start because we have not yet I don't think it'll take me straight out and said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote\nFills that I have these meetings with ah the officials from the Taliban\nJust uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one confirmation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nAdjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ... ... you didn't know he is very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't have to be clear then you I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban and it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided\nThat far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are are in Maine in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process Africans do own and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor success it's not that we wouldn't want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be ashamed that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm already asked by a ... it through a process right on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell well the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see he wet weather the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and on the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in a in a democratic process and let the African people choose\nHow ... we have to end it there but I Do thank you very much for joining me on hold talk\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has supported by Elijah Craig bourbon and

assigned has given Northern Ireland uh degreed stability prior to that\nWas in decades of conflict Tyson's of murders and bombs and people were fair to the troubles which doesn't seem adequate enough to me it's part of the good friday agreement the British Army would have been on the streets of Northern Ireland there would've been checks on roads and people being stopped in their cars and\nI must have peace day not fell away and essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border\nSo people can come and go to any restriction we know how to shoot documents that the idea that you might go back to there being any sort of the presidents or a military presence or anything like that along the border is if the concern to people\nPeople took the risk of finance returning if there is a pool to reestablish between the Irish republican Northern Ireland it's a real threat\nI think that it is you know when people talk about a return to the trouble is I Do think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back two decades of sectarian strife I think about the hard border\nDecades of sectarian strife\nI think about a hard border would introduce would bring all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups of death and the Republicans and what are most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton sad\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are carrying that work would become a target\nThan it is that police Judy to defend people here are being targeted so that's the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the play service here has serious concerns about bought a

parties in Northern Ireland devote persuasion is all said that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border

from that whereas the majority of the party's view the box so it's sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders are for the last few days and\nThey said to me you know we've
