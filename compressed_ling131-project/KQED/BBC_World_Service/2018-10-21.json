them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half\nBefore school started after a bunch of training they're running their first drill and the school building with a gun French and the boxes [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district ... hire the best record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team recently pollock rather than doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in the small safe they've been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw them around a bunch of drugs\nAnd then all of them the goal was to render their safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drought\nOkay we're gonna play tape a decision to warn listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blank study fire during these drills so the first\nLittle glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe now you have to put your finger on the sensor is definitely\nAnd tricky\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John ... is a principal for grade six twelve he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise] he's got a gun he's ... bullet proof that he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and one\nOf these shootings and not acted details nothing nothing this way [noise]\n\nElementary awareness in the elementary wing [noise]\nElementary weighing the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's a lot this happens automatically when the focus into lockdown\nThe he and the two guys with him or stock ... for his keys\nAnd he's trying to find the right one ... he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go [noise] Erica [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school aside and they find the shooter right there [noise]\nThat's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just tightening their side\nWasn't great that wasn't the attorney compared to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was he got the doors\nWe said so controversial\nTo put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nBut I I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department are being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn so I went out\nAnd started learning how to shoot a gun and how to handle it down\nAnd which is different you know first time you should be done that's pretty scary so scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd one exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis as a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you\nCan't miss [noise] I Can't miss because if I miss\nThere's a possibility somebody else getting her\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise]\nI Can't let it be me who hurts us doing it in my school\nThough of course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking I I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\n\nBecause if I miss there's a possibility somebody else getting her [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it\nBe me who hurts\nA student at my school\nThough of course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating are worth thinking [noise] I I wouldn't believe [noise] but [noise] knees\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\n[noise] mhm [noise] mhm [noise]\nThe shootings do just continue to happen [noise]\nDo they end up with them we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks a path to just be the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish the shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nAt one of our show today we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually things to work and help\nWB easy Chicago it's this American Life America ...\n[noise] [noise]\n...\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty sure the trying to figure out the best way to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than the worst day I mean they knew what to do we knew what\nEven still even with that we\nPatch it'd be easy for the I'm going\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question when our producers Robin semi and went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threat hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDoug lifted the school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that news clip you just heard\nAnd the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard thank and being proactive once she and other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single classroom you know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class together they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery ... ... this is what occurred black and this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kids might have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew they were asked to non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors suburban day they're on an alternating schedule [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the clawed it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in yes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing there were terrified people running and I just I could not in all consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how much you've been taught\nYou can choose to follow the protocol and follow your ending for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter]\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder you're kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway [noise] the group is small enough to fitness applied closet some lesser told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark\nExcept didn't faith is led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there was a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was grace in her arm liable it thank God and I didn't hear from\nHer for a while in our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in around and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police have as you said this is a police anyone in here\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police have anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police's anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that in training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nSo I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\nIs it and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands I\n\nWas told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the court has door and grabs the handle of two hands and polls that closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nBases the teacher who's our most grazed she survived Scott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway\nAnd there's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare [noise] but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation someone that's hard to study and they both\nTold me that having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I moved out to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of the ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnston research is what the fact of and these drills and maybe your university\nAnd it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew they done it Douglas like tapering over windows\nCheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ... all the codes their colors and meanings can films I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAnd all I I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat families active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the ... I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more waves response for shooting sometimes you Daniel room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision\nI told her about actually curse how she eats dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of students from ever rose up right from her school for the call\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids the problem with\nThat and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened\nNow does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gum and being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricade at her door right away it would've been way harder to tell the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional locked down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she

squatting behind because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help\nThem at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school period\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nI Want her to know about Barack heating\nAnd I want her to know about running in fighting back\nI Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to reckon with [noise]\nI wanted to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school ... point about don't take codes\n... like

wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie wasn't college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started\nJesse find called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming just [noise]\nCornel screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting [laughter] what is he talking about just Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trashed\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and took the no never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in living rooms sliding down a law he picked her up and took her to their couch re holder\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people were injured and then five months later\nThere was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive in a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw\nTheir faces\nAnd he said that's what made it look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other or they think crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's when I looked like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy said it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the Philips has said there was also a strong an instance sense of ... that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings you parents

that even the Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in
