really mild and calm and saying oh everything's going to be OK I'm going to do this I'm On the last you know give me a good fight that showed me you're gonna do\nRepublican David Robie disagrees\nThere's no comparison between them to do I like everything Trump dust no but you know that's just who he is you take the deal with the bat what he's done positive for the country outweighs anything negative is centered on\nThe father five works for the department of Veterans Affairs in his spare time he and his wife raise chickens and grow vegetables inside their families greenhouse Robie explained his support for Carol Miller\nOn a moderator she helped moderate it here's an example of the exchange between the incumbent Senator Bob Menendez and his Republican challenger let's listen\nTo Jersey is so over tax I go all around the state I don't mean one person says taxes are too low a New Jersey everyone says overturned\nAnd when you pay your tax bill remember senator Menendez who voted for over five hundred tax increases in his tenure including increasing taxes on your Social Security check\nWhat we shouldn't have is a two trillion dollar tax bill that my opponent supports and that he helped the person who drove the tax bill being office the president of the United states Donald Trump\nAnd now that they have two trillion dollars unpaid for what's the Republican leader of the Senate say as soon as this election is over we have to go after entitlements Medicare Medicaid Social security\nAs you say if he can Mr ... who is a Republican or a candidate challenging Bob Menendez mark a they did come back to taxes is one of the things you know David Was just saying is not is not terribly effective that'd be terribly effective for Democrats this year\nYou know I mean I think that the New Jersey race I think has to be understood that bought bought an end as the Democrat in a state if when Democrats talk about winning back the house\nThe three Keystone cornerstone to that strategy or California, Pennsylvania New Jersey where the Democrats I'd add to it today at Iowa possibly but I mean those are the states where the Democrats going to pick up the majority of their seats so the fact that the racist close is is a reflection on anything else\nOn not simply the Republican challenges campaign where he's been very deep pocketed a and run a ... a very strong campaign but Bob Menendez is it'd be a recall\nHad a a a a hung jury on his own a a conspiracy an a corruption charges\nAnd I think that that's what this race is about more than more than any national issues I just say to David preexisting conditions is a value gay that uh you know it it it it isn't just you know whether we're going to French kiss after the prom if the value of a health care health care for people who can't afford it is a value it's a real value\nMark this is a family show I just wanted to remind sorry I'm just saying okay\nWell just on the on the the ... debate it strikes me that what we just heard in that clip was a Republican promising to cut taxes and the Democrats saying this guy's going to take away your Medicare entitlements that's a debate we've been having since Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty or maybe Nineteen fifty six\nTo me Trump does represent a shift in how we view politics is no longer that debate is a central it's much more what do we think about immigration what do we think about America's role in the world and it's more open closed less big government versus while government and it takes a little while for the other ... other races to adapt to this new field but I Do think Trump\nAnd the global populist around the world have really changed the terms of debate and what we just heard there could've been said anytime list there to the forty\nMark I mean the point is he he's changing the polls at basically the political polls mark going I mean okay oh LA not poll\nNo nope no question Jodie in twenty twelve and Mitt Romney was the Republican nominee there was a widespread consensus\nOn immigration is an issue Republicans were essentially the Republican position was that they were from Wall liberalized immigration perhaps the Democrats were who are concerned about immigrants are representing threats on an hourly jobs\nBut at the same time it's only four percent of Republicans considered a top issue\nThis is now Donald Trump's party twenty three percent of Republicans now consider this the top issue in twenty Eighteen that is Donald Trump's party that isn't the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan or the Republican Party of George W. Bush the Republican Party of Mitt Romney\nAre so ... Davis right there is a change in Donald Trump when you win this race with about him\nHe he I Will say this\nWe have seen I think probably the last press conference with Sarah Huckabee Sanders has the press secretary not reflects on her ... Trump is now the press voice of this administration you may have noticed that the White House now he's the one who holds the press conferences\nAnd holds hostage Democratic senators who happened to be standing there at the same time I bet that this and this was written produced and directed this administration this government by Donald Trump\nWe come back to the to the same to that point David\nYeah and he you know you see how it goes back to the ... and again and again it issue was made to order for them to me it's an exaggeration I mean we've had\nRefugees come to this country before we haven't had a national crisis over we haven't had to send down the national guard we would've process these things are a country of three hundred million people we can handle if it's two thousand and if they really are refugees who need protection as we can handle it but that's not how it's being played out of this feeling of like the invasion of the hordes from barbarian and you know some\nAre and so a ... that is\nThat's the issue for him right now and on that note work and thank you both David Brooks marshals thank you thank you\nThank you both David Brooks Marcel thank you

...\nGone\nDaughter Bridget played by two time Oscar winner Hilary Swank returns home to help the family decide what to do next\nAnd I felt the most vulnerable than I ever had as an actor in the world because it was\nPlaying someone I felt with a similar to me that a woman finding our way and I mean for so long I women are just by nature and nurture and we take care of people that's what we do and that's what we're taught and do\nSo at what point do you say this isn't right for me and I need to take care of myself first and stop pleasing other people in order to live my most authentic life did\nYou also brings some personal experience do all of this\nMy dad got along transplant and with this whole caretaker I took time off and and I was helping my dad for three years and I think it definitely helps you understand\nWhat a crisis like this and it helps you remind you to be living in the moment\nMichael Shannon plays route son Nick\nIt's about the cycle of giving and taking care of that happens in families or you know you're born and then you need to be taken care of and then as you grow up and learn how to take care of yourself and then you were to take care of other people and then eventually find yourself in a position where where you need to be taken care of again\nShe had on me\nNot Emma dish for handling and she was looking at me like she was she\nEliminated she's smart

everyone Raul coming of age in our own way and our own whatever time that it I feel like every year I'm trying to figure myself out you know it does not not just for a teenager or someone in their twenties I think we're continually evolving and trying to figure out what's right and what's best for us\nThe best for the characters and best for the actors playing these roles there's two different kinds of people that get into\nActing or people that are very focused or nurses are vanity or like I wanted to be famous I wanted to be in the spotlight and then I really just beginning 'cause they're just genuinely curious about other people and they just pay a lot of attention to like what's going on around them and they have a lot of empathy\nI became an actor because I Love people and I love
