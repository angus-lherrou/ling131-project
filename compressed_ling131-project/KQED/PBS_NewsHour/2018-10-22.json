Greg ... thank you to be but\n\nAs we reported earlier the President Trump has announced his intention to pull the United states out of a landmark Cold War nuclear weapons training struck Thirty years ago with the Soviet Union so what would the effect of that be at is the treaty outdated as the president claims\n[noise] he was Nineteen eighty seven and President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev liberated the medium range nuclear forces treaty as calming Cold War tension [noise]\nFlash forward to this past weekend and President Trump's decision to abandon it\nThat have stayed in the room and we bonded it reversed for Russia's not on the Missouri River we're going to pull out\nThe IMF scrap thousands of ground launch nuclear and conventional missiles [noise]\nRanges from three hundred and thirty four hundred miles\nBut in twenty four teen then President Obama accused Russia of developing and testing a cruise missile in violation of the treaty\nOn Sunday President Trump echoed that charge and today he said China should be added to the agreement\nIs a threat to whoever you want to leave Russia credited with everybody else wants to play that game you can't do that you can't play that game on\nThe Russians deny violating the patch\nAnd claimed that it is the U.S breaching the treaty with the Europe based missile defense system it has\nBuilt [noise] Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov condemned Mr Trump's announcement Lavrov said last night\nThat he wants answers from us national security adviser John Bolton who is in Moscow this week\nWe wait for an official explanation from our us colleagues in case John Bolton was ready to give them rule of course listen to him and assess the situation after that\nFor his part former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev set in a statement that quote it can't be that hard to understand that discarding such agreements is narrow minded French President Emmanuel Macron's office\nSaid he to voice misgivings in a Sunday phone call with President Trump [noise]\nWe ask whether the president has made the right decision to withdraw from the nuclear arms treaty\nAnd for answers we turn to Richard Burt even as assistant secretary of state for Europe and then served as US ambassador to Germany during the Nineteen eighties every intimately involved with the original I. N. F. trading negotiations is now managing partner\nAt the consulting firm ... associates and Rebecca Heinrich she was a legislative assistant focusing on foreign and defense policy for a\nRepublican member of Congress she's now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute a think tank in Washington and we welcome both of you to the news hour Rebecca Hi rushed in first and you uh had told us to think the president's doing the right thing by trying saying he wants to pull out why\nWell this treaty I'm\nA Cold War treaty the Russians had been in violation of the treaty for many years as early uh two thousand eight the Obama administration made clear in two thousand fourteen that the Russians were in violation of the treaty and began the soft diplomatic approach to try to get the Russians to comply with the treaty they did not that they started a moving forward with deploying\nUm a missile that would violate the treaty um and and so the Trump Administration came in and try to tougher approach tried to get them to comply to no avail and so it's time you know that the arms control what's going to mean anything it has to be enforced\nAnd so it undermines arms control in general if there aren't hard consequences for violations such as the Russians have been have been doing\nRichard if the Russians are in violation why should the U.S stand\nWell this isn't the first time that we've accused the Russians would be in violation and I think in this case they are clearly in violation of the agreement but we vote or other major compliance problems and a number of different treaties this is the first time we've actually left a treaty when we haven't been capable of resolving issue I don't think\nThe Trump Administration in taking this decision went the extra mile in actually trying to solve this problem I think\nUh the the public diplomacy of this issue is just as important as substance and the problem is is that people should be blaming the Russians but they're not as by virtue of this pet to us decision\nThe United states is being blamed for stepping out of a very important arms control agreement and our allies see another example of American unilateralism\nWhat about our that climbers what about to his point that the Trump Administration didn't do enough to try to bring Russia into complained\nThe the trap administration did try and has been working with allies and President Trump took office the Obama administration was working quietly with allies to try to get to um to try to put\nPolicy of this issue is just as important as substance and the problem is is that people should be blaming the Russians but they're not as by virtue of this pet Jewish decision the United states is being blamed for stepping out of a very important arms control agreement and our allies see another example of American unilateralism\nWhat about a word that Congress what about to his point that the Trump Administration didn't do enough to try to bring Russia into compliance\nThat that the Trump Administration did try and has been working with allies since President Trump took office the Obama administration was working quietly with allies to try to get to\nUm to try to put pressure on the Russians and you know enough is enough to get to the point the other issue that's happening as while the Russians are in violation and continuing to become more provocative in their violations\nThen you also had this other issue which is that other countries like China\nIran North Korea or not party to the ... treaty she also had a problem of relevance is the treaty relevant at combined with this issue of Russia's violation if the other countries like China are going to be developing these missiles to than the United states doesn't want to be tied to a treaty which it is the only one that biding by it\nWhich about what about that that that other countries are losing I had a\nOne way or the only the only real concrete is of concern here and the president mentioned at today's China and China is developing a new land based missiles targeted against the United states assets in the region and our allies\nBut we have no plans and no need for ground based missiles remembered this treaty only focus on ground based missiles\nWere not going to deploy ground based missiles and South Korea or Japan or anywhere else in nature we're going to deal with this problem is we've done in the past we are going to deploy them on air launched air on air launch missiles on aircraft or submarine launch missiles\nAnd there are no limit on that so we can certainly respond to a growing Chinese threat without scrappy know very important treaty a treaty that is critical to our allies there's been at the core really as a U.S European security relationship for over Thirty years\nPush back and said that there was some justification of your woman mister she had overreached in some way\nYes so this judge judge O'Connor and Texas has become sort of the the go to court for individuals who are looking to strike down aspects of the Obama administration's a accomplishments protecting transgender people\nBut his decision is truly an outlier in the face of decades of case law in which Republican and democratic appointed judges awake are recognizing that discrimination against the transition to individual\nIs just as much a form of sex discrimination as it is religious discrimination to penalize someone for having converted from one religion to another\nThere are many cases out there that actually sort of go through not only sort of ... logical argument but also the scientific basis for understanding that your gender identity is as much a part of who you are as other aspects of your sex that have clearly been held this protected against sex discrimination whether it's non conforming appearance\nWhether it's other ways in which you don't necessarily conform with your employers idea about how men or women are supposed to act in the workplace\nSo this is truly is the lawless action that we're seeing right now a disregard of case law that this administration doesn't like to be able to achieve an outcome
