deliberate practice we've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become great at just about anything\nToo often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious things become great at anything you need both talent in lots of huge but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success and leave money failure it's what you might call multi factorial\nA lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also ended up identical\nAs much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced and then\nAlso

the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to be physicians and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThere should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems\nCrazy so okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance the three time major league baseball all star\nYes you know ... and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best get on your team\nYou I've played every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the up there always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parents a child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son\nThat boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals in ...\nOh man well my my life have literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar the athletes they both come from very athletic family\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier ... who is one two and then put gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and neck surgery and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kinda did every sport when he was growing up\nAnd the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson\nHe was a hockey player he wrestled he could be a knack he adds race NATO acts I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas Donald a is\nAbout six to um lean a ... guy\nThomas played basketball at a small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player in the college programs far from ... one day in the gym he was bragging about how high you could jump\nAnd the best jumper on the track team a guy named Carlos overheard him and said you know you're talking all that trash um you wouldn't even clear bars six foot six and real competition and Donald says yes yes I Would\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem\nThat's eleven my freakonomics friends and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nBy my calculation about ... four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools any so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that's a crazy like this college fencing even existed and the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools\nThat have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ...\nHave a fencing the the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says eBay there's Sabre the soil and there's male or female fancy\nAnd given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids you ever try to be sensors end up being college is not about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does lead at think fencing increases your chances from that point four percent resigned\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else cups and something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nGod if you want to go to an Ivy League school forget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like\nThree hundred thousand kids\nPlaying high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be called soccer players but the the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids if you turned into sensors of it\nIs actually one and us so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a ... a year he strangely enough gravitated toward\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by deference

the gym or the track at five AM band as Shawn Johnson told us earlier he might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of this freak occurrence my coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese\nAnd when he was three years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast\nAnd he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa a lot of places and had this dream\nThis American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians that were also children and how to balance in life and were you know fun loving and had a\nTrue childhood Johnson had started her training at the different gym\nAnd I loved it it was awesome but chow my coach that took me too I'm backs opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house and my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was\nReally really blessed to fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have very loving very very protective people around me\nAnd he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me safe and I am forever grateful for that ... oh\nSean Johnson's good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether through bad luck\nMore through something much more concrete like lack of money over the past decade youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involved some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play as much as it just scares me because it's become so much of a business a lot of self and less about\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIt's a tournament in California this we go next week and you go about it after that it's Texas and I don't understand oh two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports that's being near ... all\nLike what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm\nAt the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one going back to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor Amman play um\nI think there's a trickle down effect from there there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to bear itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one though where the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues\nSo I look at these factors the industrialization\nMass incarceration as suburbanization so the industrialization lack of tax base we notice no funds to what construct it maintain balls feels\nProbably at high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nThen in college I wanted to be a ... computer

it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nFor football and I say all that to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you've given up through the course of your life\n[noise]\nYou shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox for he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years\nHe's still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made
