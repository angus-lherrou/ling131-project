Firestein thank you very much to both [noise]\n\n\nThree weeks from today voters will head to the polls for the ... election the recent NATO latchkey filters suppression incentives erase it had many wondering if they're still able to cast their ballots\nTo take a closer look at where voting rights stand right now I'm joined by Carol ... professor at African American studies at Emory University in Atlanta Georgia\nAnd the author undeveloped one person nails out\nHow voter suppression is destroying our democracy in fact I understand welcome to the nature of our I Want to begin by asking you\nAbout some more recent conversation and I notice depression they tend to look back just a few years and at twenty Thirteen Supreme Court to send that decision to roll back the protection of the historic Nineteen sixty five voting rights act what\nHave the historic Nineteen sixty five voting rights act what's your take on how significant that move was\nUh the guarding of the voting rights act in the Shelby County beholder decision of twenty Thirteen were significant we had already had um the the the sowing the seeds of the erosion\nI'm beginning and the two thousand election where you had the language of voter fraud really coming to the fore\nThere and then being embedded in federal law with the help America vote act\nUm although voting fraud were had been debunked 'em by the time that that had happened but by the time we get to the twenty Thirteen election\nThe ground had really been sewn for this and if in fact I'm just let all of the kinds of of the voting rights abuses um run loose um we see that in many of the states that had been cleared\nHad previously been under pre clearance from the department of justice and we also see that in states that hadn't been pre cleared but had taken on the mantle of stopping um suppose that voter fraud\nWhen you say pre clearance I Want to clarify for audience these were stationed at a history of discriminatory practices when he came to voting statutes they no longer had to get federal approval to change those rules but when you say if it can't\nWho did it affect um what population how many people\nAnd so where you see the the effects really um come come from what I call the Obama coalition I'm In the two thousand eight election um you had um\nHe brought with his incredible ground game Fifteen million new voters to the polls overwhelmingly African American\nLatino Asian American young and poor when we began to look at these voter suppression laws that's the group that is targeted\nUm that is the group where issues such as voter id issues such as a closing voter I'm I'm voting poll um issues such as voter roll purges\nAll of those begin to take into account and hit each one of those groups sometimes\nSimultaneously sometimes one more than the others but\nThat's where we're seeing in and we're seeing in in terms of\nA for instance in Wisconsin I'm with the voter id law\nUm after the twenty sixteen election of study was done and it was found that ... percent of whites were stopped from voting by the voter id law with twenty seven percent of African Americans were stopped\nUm we're seeing with voter roll 'em purges in Ohio for instance where\nTwo million have been purged off of the rules so far but uh in one of those major purchased twenty five percent came primarily slowly out of Cuyahoga County which is Cleveland which it has a sizable African American population\nAnd you mentioned the voter ID laws a voter role changes as well a lot of people who are putting those steps into place at the state and local level say these are necessary to protect\nThe integrity of our elections chicken you can make sure that they are stare so why wouldn't we want our voter rolls update it why wouldn't we want people to have to show and I do when they vote\nAnd that's one of the great ways the way voter suppression works is that it sounds reasonable until you see how it's operational life and when you also understand for instance that the issue of voter id is based on the lie of voter fraud and what I mean by that is that Justin Levitt a professor\nOf California did a study and from two thousand to two thousand and fourteen he counted up all of the votes and all of the elections and came to one billion votes\nOut of that he identified thirty one cases of voter fraud thirty one cases out of one billion vote that's hardly the massive rampant voter fraud that we consistently hear as needing to have all of this protection via voter id but based on that lie of voter fraud\nUm and and I say that lie because even when the proponents of voter fraud or really call to to bring out the evidence of it such as Kris Kobach out of Kansas are Gregory Abbott out of Texas they cannot identify\nMassive rampant voter fraud at best Greg Abbott was able to come up with two cases in all of Texas and civil\nProtecting the integrity of the ballot box then is not the issue because the ballot box is not under siege by voter fraud and so what we get then is that kind of sounding reasonable with we need voter id but for what\nI'm In the way that the voter IDs are crafted is like North Carolina looked at the data by race on the kinds of ideas that African Americans had and didn't have and then crafted the law to go for the ones that African Americans did not have\n'em and and that is what we're seeing in Alabama for instance Alabama said you need to have a government issued photo ID\nProfessor edited and I'm hearing you say that there's a problem around the country than because often we talk about it like it's in this house that you've named a number of states stairway your studies have shown that their courage and block to leave it there for now professor Carol

president asks us for war and the president will yet again hopefully not soon it has to be for something that's absolutely essential for our national interest the American people have to support it
