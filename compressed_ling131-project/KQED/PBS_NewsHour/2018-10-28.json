disabled [noise]\n\nAlthough I got to tell you I got Ninety nine problems and told me it's just one [noise] as if there was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and you saw it live young that's so cool so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake shake your hand and foot within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nYou know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that just something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially I Do\nNaturally because I've made a stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy out of the New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on\nWith me [noise] yeah because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so\nBecause I mean this really has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy um characters on television that this is made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about that in a way that they've never heard before but we have been ... because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty commonplace for people to do that to me [noise]\n\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't\nMy father's ... what you can do it yet you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters were ... I was not been if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went to the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper\nMy\nFather taught me how I Walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he uses he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me\n[noise] my inner river was very strong and I [noise]\n\nBy that first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been punched one too many times [noise]\nToo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out five I have to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhen did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning\nNo one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still guy on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his therapy\n[laughter] you know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or the challenges their humor right Andy\nThey dealt with their demons right or the challenges their humor right and do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy in the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media\nAnd we always made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalking about guys are talking about sorrow probably you know I'm like I really just wanted to talk about beyond say that [laughter]\nSo it gets exhausting having to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now that I Do battle because having grown up with you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle East I'm really worried\nAbout where we are right now in this country and when I did the dog I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really thought it was the disability that was going to be the thing that I was championing [noise]\nGrowing up there are only fix Arabs in my town and they were all my

tad radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and on the show too\nPainfully funny ideas about humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life so we're just hearing from comedian again first saw it and she had a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia\nWhich at times required little patient\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more bees without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip you took with the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after it came out something happened back in New York at least one again usually felt welcomed and accepted\nAnd group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's in New York City subway system now that's truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use the better Fox but [noise]\nDecided oh why not macho own poster campaign right that does not things about Muslims so my fellow comedians you know be dollar decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money work for over five months that was approved in into we're supposed to do up uh the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content let's take a look at a couple of those posters here one I'm a mother has been you know\nMuslims [noise] let's see what would you know they have great for recipe\nOf us are considered political by the NCAA or the mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting it gives you a delightful to try to fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying a couple\nOf comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians want [noise]\nWith a very weird feeling I was like as a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we sent hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny\nBut just changing all danger I still think that social justice companies one of our best weapon [noise]\n\nYou talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we'd like set up a table called me about religion we're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was also the New Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar salivating already and the rules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that we totally stipulate for the girls who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of raw\nFood for on it is the\nMan people guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was a violent um came from the curve on\nMary said my lord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nAnd so we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy thoughts on them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was yeah\nYeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God\nKnow a lot of their lives in three of them do you know [noise]\nYou could even having that moment of like oh my God it's not a whole lot of difference between the three of them get [noise] incredible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I performed um in in red states and blue states in one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they want to offer you a coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found that I said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get in return and that's what I stand as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing was performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's when I found a way I like to look at it as you get one person to laugh and a couple of people won't laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and the\nCapitals add up to some measure of of a popular and shifting perception [noise] and that is\nSocial change but it takes time and it takes like millions Abdi [noise] chocolate [noise]\nComedian against our side she's the author of how to make white people\nLaugh and she also hosts a

funny Memphis is leaving [laughter]\nThis is Kevin real as the guest said the writer and they stand up comedian\nRelays every other Thursday that are taking\nThese as we make sense but she's ... she's ready for it though [noise]\nHouses of it was marvelous [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living but being funny is also a way he deals with lights humor I think is either\nKind of like an invitation or a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts and stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within\nFor Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would\nCome in waves and you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark helpless twice\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly middle west I didn't want people to eat that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin real tells a story on the stage and you can already tell this story is gonna sound pretty different from the other ones you've heard on the show", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PBS
