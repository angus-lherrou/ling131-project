I Am the director general of the uh world\nTrade Organization uh since to any sort of teen\nAnd would you describe the director general role of the WTO as essentially a diplomatic role\nThe diplomatic role of the uh a director general is the one that he has to perform as a as a building roads bridges he has to approximate positions\nYou have one hundred and sixty four members now a to guide and um and they have very different perspectives of uh uh\nEverything on everything on on politics economics today on\nFreakonomics radio the conversation with the WTO's referred to as a beta about what makes for a successful negotiation\nI Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten\nWe talk about whether the global economy is doing as well as the current numbers indicate\nIt's amazing that I Do hear people say oh but the economy's great\nCourse it's great it hasn't been affected you\nEnd which came first the president for the terrorists\nPresident Trump didn't just happen\nYou know you you didn't just fall from the skies are [noise]\n\nThere is freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house even now [noise]\nThe world Trade Organization was founded only in Nineteen Ninety five but has its roots in Britain would conference in Nineteen forty four which also gave rise to the world bank and the international Monetary Fund\nThese institutions were set up to help resuscitate him grow the post war global economy\nBut the political timing wasn't right for a global trade organization instead an agreement between twenty three countries called the general agreement on tariffs and trade was signed in Nineteen forty seven when the number of signatory countries reached a hundred and twenty three the agreement was form of mine and given more teeth\nWith the establishment of the WTO its mission is to quote ensure that trade flows smoothly predictably and freely as possible but in recent months\nPredictably and freely as possible but in recent months global trade has become quite a bit less news and much less predictable with the U.S threatening or enacting massive tariffs against a variety of countries and industries with retaliatory tariffs quickly following\nThat's where we begin the conversation with revert to as a beta we spoke a few weeks ago I was in New York and as a beta was that WTO headquarters in Geneva [noise]\nSo we are in a particularly\nNoisy a trade environment at the moment it in the headlines all the time considering the threatened an actual terrorists emanating from the U.S or in considering the U.S role in the global economy what share of your time currently\nI'm is taken with issues that concern directly or indirectly the U. S.\nAre you talking about the largest economy in the world\nSo it's natural that a lot of my time or we'll have some kind of relationship with our actions taken by the United states also because an accent that it's taken by the United states has repercussions are everywhere\nAre across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time\nUh has to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from the skies in an ambient that was a a knock ripe and then found a direction that didn't that that was not there he is the result of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and or if you don't understand the forces or that put him there I think that's part of getting the wrong diagnosis\nAnd I have to tell you there's a lot of sympathy for some things that are said or on the part of the United states\nThat are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO as opposed to terrorists generally and most economists agree that terrorists are really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where terrorists exists under a different name one of the U.S is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version and their their government subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar\nThe youth the WTO have any ability to directly request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time industries like protection\nThey want to be supported by the government wants to get help and they are now seen this um a price in what we call behind the border\nProtection a and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because terrorists you can measure\nTerrorists you include only a spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board there measure you don't know when they come you don't know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a communities are hearing the W. to discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nNot really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are are put in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding than ah what other countries apply and that would be for the protection of the consumer\nOr it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure but they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations they're just stop trade altogether\nSo that's ah whatever and infinite tariff at the border only measured and [noise]\nThe WTO says the average tariff rate among its members fell by Fifteen Percent between organization founding in Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand Thirteen [noise]\nThere are however many caffeine Harris rules are less stringent for\nDeveloping countries for instance furthermore trade deals negotiated in good faith by one country administration can be deemed by a leader administration to be unfair or just on power the\nNAFTA the U.S Canada Mexico free trade treaty was signed a year before the WTO came into existence President Trump was not a fan of NAFTA\nBut when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us are terrorists and other countries responded by making their own deals I'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\nTo be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage a some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course they can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but are they are very very Frank and ah we explore all kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance\nOf the system and not to compromise the system and I would say that pretty much everybody I talked to a ... tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen [noise]\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be\nYou know so in the line when others are\nComing up after the break with the head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask him\nTo make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nOh well don't worry Roberto as of eight has plenty more to say we'll hear it after the break [noise]\nFreakonomics anyhow is supported by target preventing future and had hired a new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and highlights contracts in cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city future at Harvard have outlined apple pie ... cats are found\nFreakonomics radio they supported by progressive insurance offering snapshot device

[noise] but it turns out the government just stopped looking for the movie theater and the first guy how you're going to know how many people in fact that ignoring sneak up on the next reveal [noise]\n\nReveal is coming up I'm well at four o'clock about the western forty minutes coming up on weekend all things considered we'll hear the latest on the shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nThat is coming up at five o'clock weekend all things considered tonight patchy fog later tonight otherwise and mostly cloudy nights temperatures in the fifties will have a cooling trend over the next couple of days and then it will warm up again in the beginning or the middle of the week\n[noise]\nAnd that's it's freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nRoberto Acevedo director general of the world Trade Organization was appointed to the post in two thousand Thirteen when the train waters were considerably less choppy than they are today [noise]\nSo you were from\nBrazil and you've studied electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here have those three factors Brazilian engineering and being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um well the\nGood thing about being a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse prospective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspects of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife ah and ah she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a\nLove story and it's on rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering lake solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a constructive bars and a figure out a way to make them more\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's why the accurate but uh I I found out that you're forever learning how to ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case for at least another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed countries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative relationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors into domestic economy will lose me gain a many are better off with the with the trading relationship but that some news in the sense that they are not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories closed or in particular sector and are you cannot ignore that\nI think what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things fester we don't require 'em as much human imposed as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for a government sent for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies\nI had their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are ... are they have a role of course but the minor in this structural change and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution\nFor this will be hurting much more than help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what's the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand uh the situation and reach the right diagnosis you forget the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\nThere is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so\nThere will be a need to rethink the whole educational system or in countries how to support the displaced are people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how old are you will help them\nFind another economic activity that will work for them and to help them support their family and the state of course I and I I understand that people don't want this I myself have very strong reservations against a a big state\n[noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio with your host Stephen ...\nSo I wouldn't say that my pop economics is through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economist at ... dot com are\nThat's Mary on a monthly Cato I'm a professor and the economics of innovation and how they value at university\nLike value at University College London\nYou also advised as far as I can tell a number of governments and governmental institutions\nShorts I'm currently on the council of economic advisors for the first minister Scotland I'm also the special adviser for ... to their research commissioner in the European Union and I used to be on the advisory board offer Jeremy I'm Courtney [noise]\nAnd I resigned because of Brexit\nSaid share a special advisor to the secretary general of the CD is that right\nYeah so the city's currently rethinking its economic narrative and so they have a group that literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that a group\nGotcha and also um ... advisory panel in Finland is that true or yeah try I didn't\nRealize when as a whole and yes [laughter]\nThere's actually even like thirty mark\nI'm going to be that one university economist has the ear of so many governments and institutions for a clue let's get back to why much Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about Martin says that he's known as a critic of capitalism but actually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic\nOf capitalism which is technological change we shouldn't forget that futile ism was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is affect the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of laws that it's constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution\nAnd consumption work and marks really talks about that quite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it and the dynamic\nOf always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological change and\nBut it's not just technological change interests much cut out she has a relatively radical stance on the value that created by technological change what do I mean by radical stance\nConsider the titles of her books the first was called the entrepreneurial state those two words entrepreneurial in state typically are not used to gather\nMust have got his latest book is called the value of everything making taking in the global economy when it comes to the relationship between government and economic growth Martha ... who knows how the popular and heard does\nIt goes like this might thought the government put a basket case you're the bureaucrats they don't know what they're\nDoing but she sees it differently you know what would you be without a GPS publicly financed what would Google be without the Internet publicly financed de\n... was born in Rome but grew up in Princeton New Jersey where her father took a job as a research assistant at university\nShe studied history and international relations at tough and got her PHD in economics at the new school for social research in New York and now she lives with her family in London in an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T um where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine\nOr do you said well they're expensive that's the one I saw that the glass of wine you ordered costs forty pounds\nI made an error they made an error you well I didn't specify how they treat you know they treat you they trick you I don't know that because I was a woman and they didn't show me the price you know today gentlemen or if it's with us kids out but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw and it turned out to be the most expensive one that\nGot anyone who read that article at the company a Soviet ... social [laughter] right\nSo to someone who says you know free markets are\nAlmost always good and governments are almost always bad and if somebody says that you say what\nThe first is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFree from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm In order to be more innovative more dynamic I say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active there's little hands or the state my\nPoint is actually the state to listen to the ball and almost everything a Silicon Valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important that companies in that area but the role that public after played was really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yeah\nExactly I'm Talking about\nBoth agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream doing applied research\nLike a dark side but also his sister organization in more recent time called art they eat the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nUncertain high risk a research\nSome evidence of the government funding that much to kind of just talking about DARPA or the defense advanced research Projects Agency created during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet\nBecause over the years produced several kinds of missiles and airplanes as well as the first computer metals miniature GPS receivers each de displays and the digital personal assistant\nGPS receivers each de displays and the digital personal assistant so ARPA e or the advanced research Projects Agency for energy found that under George W Bush has funded a variety of energy projects including battery storage tech\nThe department of energy starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested more than a hundred and thirty million dollars studying the extraction techniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health has helped fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy the FBI\nThese public institutions have absolutely co created value\nIt's quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the copy Larry\nI don't know that when you use as so instead of saying the public sector do you risk the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating and enabling business it's really about you know taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and clubs that government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in return how big of a problem is that so\nIt's a huge problem and it comes back to how we talk about things I also remind people um you know play tell us and that story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we\nTell about who create value hasn't sat created the stories that are that justify the extraction of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home\nThe U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars and part of that agenda was really also to direct that this will stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama\nFinanced some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that lists for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nTheir new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder and make solar energy panels\nWhy does the taxpayer has to be the one footing the bill to try to shift some power solar power worse people\nSaid my God the government what a basket case you're the bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of\nYou know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way on which first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of\nA U.S government financing early on but more concretely at the same time that it was financing cylinder and also finance tests for a very similar amount of money so they passed last car got a four hundred and sixty five million guaranteed loans\nAnd when I say guaranteed I'm Talking about guaranteed by the U.S taxpayer though until enderlin by the taxpayers we're\nPretty angry that they had to pick up the bill but why did the taxpayers not know that they had also finance ... would not have changed the narrative and the perception of what the bureaucrats in Washington were doing they actually had a portfolio like any venture capitalists\nWhich you know takes on risk and so\nTo speak to any adventure capitalist they will tell you that for every success there's many failures however if you really want to be an actor capital if you have to construct your portfolio in such a way that you also get some of the upside from the wins precisely to cover that downside", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PBS NewsHour", "city":
