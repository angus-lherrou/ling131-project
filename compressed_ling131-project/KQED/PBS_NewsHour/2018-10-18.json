deficit taking a big jump over the last spending here despite significant economic growth John Yang takes a look behind the data\nUnder the government reported it just ended the fiscal year with the deficit of seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars that's a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nThe numbers getting close scrutiny because most of President Trump's one point five trillion dollar tax cuts took effect in January just three months into the spending year here to walk us through all this news hours corresponded least reduced or death and David Wessel director of the Hutchins Center on fiscal and monetary policy at the Brookings Institution\nSo let me start with you how does this number for twenty eight teams twenty three fiscal year\nHow does that fit into historical trends\nThis is a dramatic increase in recent years let's look at some numbers\nYou go back just three years ago twenty Fifteen the number of the deficit that year was four hundred and thirty nine billion dollars look at that this is almost double what it was then\nAnd it's going to continue to rise John many people now looking just two years it's going to be right around one trillion dollars according to congressional budget office and that courage on continued to get even steeper\nAs we continue to go forward now what's interesting here is this still is not as high as the deficit tour and two thousand nine and two dozen tennis for historic highs and relatively recent terms\nHowever those were years in which we had a recession we're talking about these deficits now in times of growth and a good economy and that is different\nAnd of course those projection juries court lawsuit into effect if nothing where to change now what's driving the twenty teens deficit\nIs right have you looked at keeping to the numbers of the Treasury Department put out you find some very interesting things first of all in this chair talking about taxes we look at these numbers that actual tax revenue stayed about flat it rather than about half a percent a little bit less\nSpending is what has changed much dramatically so he got slot revenue and you've got a lot more spending\nLess money not money coming in a lot of money going out you get a deficit\nWhere was the biggest wherever the bigger increase it defense spending sixty five billion dollar increase just in the past year and look at that interest on the debt we thought increase of sixty two billion dollars in what we're spending to pay off this debt now of course defense isn't the only places on increased the ... also non defense that it should Congress spent a lot more\nAnd we have a larger deficit\nSo David the or at least ... says that the ... the revenues were meeting sweat so what does that tell us about the effect of President Trump's tax cuts\nWell the economy as we said is very strong and so without a tax cut we would've seen increasing revenues we also see if you look at the numbers corporate tax receipts fell thirty percent\nAnd that's largely the result of the president's tax cuts so what we're seeing you would expect at a time like this revenues rising faster than spending because the economy strong more people working paying taxes fewer people collecting unemployment benefits and such and the deficit which Rick we see the opposite and that's largely because of the tax code\nNow David ... majority leader Mitch McConnell says it's entitlements you sort of Social Security Medicare Medicaid that's what's driving these deficit forecast is he right\nWell look if you look at what happened\nSponsorship of the kick you read the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solutions celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it in for Mike Rowe dot com\nThe deficit increased by a hundred and Thirteen million dollars do the arithmetic if you look ahead though a and you look at the projections the reason the deficit is rising just because we are spending more on Social Security Medicare and Medicaid largely because the population is aging if you look at CBS tenure projections\nBeen spending on benefits particularly for elderly people are going up interest on the debt is going up and everything else was holding counts are going down\nWe still do the deficit has had stopped being a hot button issue for a long time now it's sort of its back on the front pages is Congress do you think going to do anything about this\nNow shortly after a short answer now you have an entire Koch is a conservative the Freedom Caucus who have led with this issue in the past\nBut they were the ones who ended up voting and passing some of these larger spending bills in a deal with Democrats Republicans wanted more money for defense Democrats wanted more money for a non defense\nThey all came together I spoke to the Senate leader Mitch McConnell about this yesterday he agreed that for now it looks like they spending increases are on the rise but they've got some real problems ahead because first they've got to keep government funded starting in December and then next year they've got new budget caps they've got to work around\nRight now all the momentum is towards spending\nDavid you mentioned at the economy's in good shape the unemployment rate is low of growth is pretty strong is the reason for concern about these deficits if if everything seems to be going so well well\nThere's clearly no reason to worry about today's deficits as you say fifty are low and unemployment inflation stable I think that's why the politicians don't seem to feel the need to deal with this and they're certainly not for a much pressure from the public\nThe problem is in the future if something is unsustainable it can't go on forever and every year we're borrowing more and more money because we have promised to pay benefits to people that the current tax code will not cover\nOlder recent estimates show that in that immigrants are ... for the U.S meaning what meaning that they pay more taxes into the system that they receive but in terms of a public spending whether and benefits\nOf course the more educated and highly skilled at the immigrant like professor Perry himself I Am your dog down in front of the larger the fiscal surplus\nAnd immigrants can be a drain on state and local budgets primarily due to the cost of educating their kids but when it comes to federal budgeting immigrants both legal and undocumented compare favorably just similar native born Americans because they're less likely to be eligible for benefits and more likely to work\nSo if the lord you guys are going to get on the work Rachel Seventy Seventy five percent versus the lord you get a new team to work at a rate of fifty fifty five percent but also the stigma in applying for welfare because they've come here to work to support their feminist\nAnd its immigrants were reluctant to apply for benefits before the rule change they're terrified\nNow you have a baby girl now this is the most awesome did you think about enrolling in wet again\nAt the beginning they have a little meal with him but I just get so they told me they will be laid the fight gets weak because they wouldn't be provided and they form less\nBut as we said we didn't want to play because who's going to be a role in\nFor my when I say\nEven though which is not even targeted in the proposed rules\nAnd the other thing is changing and these ... I don't feel it really safe they can just throw them anymore\nBut one of his ... her fear seems reasonable even before the Trump Administration officially proposed the rule change does not multiple involving drafts of it had leaked and were widely covered by foreign language media the rule is so\nMassive and confusing that it's gonna make people fearful across the country\nSherry here Rhoda is CEOs Asian health services at bay area network clinics\nWe have patients that have asked to be a taken off of uh our electronic health records we have people who are afraid to sign up for food stamps legal immigrants are now at the crosshairs\nThis is about people who are legally entitled to these benefits programs but now are being told if you use them you will be denied a green card\nMillions of immigrants received benefits targeted by the rules do some like refugees are exempted they may choose to forego aid anyway it's happened before\nThe closest analog we have to what might happen from this proposed rule is what happened after the welfare reform of the Nineteen nineties with changes in immigrants eligibility for many elements of the social safety net\nUC Berkeley economist ... says the chilling effect for large misinformation and fear\nSo a policy change food stamps so we see people dropping out of where for example a dimension one dimensional too is that there are groups who are unaffected by the policy change for example citizen children who nonetheless\nDropped out of participation in programs that were affected\nBut what's the big deal if you were immigrants or their families claim benefits\nFor one thing says Asian health services Dr Kimberly Chang is immigrants are afraid to get health care that could pose a public health risk\nIf you think about infectious disease if you think about the flu season that's coming up if you think about measles if people don't come in and get those vaccines they put the American population at risk\nMore broadly pushing immigrants off benefits might save taxpayers money in the short run but it could cost money in the long run\nThose kids who get more access to Medicaid or down a fire earnings and are more economically self sufficient in adulthood and so there are socially coming to the labor market as more productive workers are generating more taxes and generating more income for their families in adulthood\nAll of these different programs are anti poverty program for a reason they're actually helping people make ends meet when times are hard\nMy own personal story is that I'm the youngest of ten we immigrated from Columbia and the Nineteen seventies we use food stamps when my father and my mother were in between jobs when they were laid off from their factory jobs and today my nine brothers and sisters and I are all professionals\nMeanwhile even though no one in her family received any benefits now Maria is still at risk of losing her right to stay here\nBecause as a new mom she's not currently working plus her American husband low income levels might raise red flags who is going to raise my kids really\nNice to have to think\nWhat are you going to do with Maria can't get a permanent green card good go with her for I guess we would be immigrants and let's go on the irony to the editor\nFor the PBS NewsHour I'm Catherine Rampell reporting from California

teammates friends and coach it over the years\nBob holder is one of the lead reporters and joins me now five thank you for making the time congratulations on an incredible series I Know the last one actually comes out tonight that let me ask you a spotlight team is the story franchise what was it about the story is Aaron Hernandez\nThat let you don't want to turn all the time and energy and resources towards his story\nIs a huge story under the broken our very own backyard here on our turf\nAnd we thought there were so many unanswered questions about every aspect of his life who we wanted to dig into he wanted to know what he was he just an outlier or is this something that we can learn some lessons from a and sort of a broader sense and then what was the role of the tea either the terrible brain damage to the football players suffer how does that affect his life\nMillions of Americans came to know Aaron Hernandez in his public life right as a very talented football star as a charismatic handsome young man\nYou and your team wrote and want to hear reports that ah that that public persona quote proved to be much less important than what he had kept hidden so why was it that he kept hidden and what did you uncover particularly about his early life\nWill he loved the he lived a double life and you know after he died there was a myth that rose that ah that that his father died when he was sixteen and the myth was that he suddenly fell apart but he was he had come up in his Ozzie and Harriet life and then suddenly everything went went awry in his life\nIn fact his father brutally beat him as a child brutally beat him as a child he was sexually molested as a child and by the time he was in middle school he was exploring the sexuality\nAnd uh it was involved with boys which would have been an incredible uh offense to his father who was extremely hold the homophobic according to his brother to brother and so he was living this double secret life he even as a child and he carried that through with him into a high school and college and later in life\nYou document how all of those forces kind of came together to reveal sort of troubling behavior over the years a pattern really when you look back on it now and yet still this was a young man who was basically fast tracked through high school through college into the pros how did\nWell it's a big business the football this is football nc and these guys are commodities are there and if they're good they're very valuable and at the University of Florida where he went up there at the age of Seventeen they pulled him out of high school six months early they wanted them so badly they got 'em down there and they ... him he was ... as you said and run ins with the law down there\nNo serious consequences on he went into the beautifully for them they want to national championship great player and they send them off to the NFL with all kinds of problems including marijuana heavy crowded marijuana use that uh that they were aware of\nEven in his professional career you've uncovered there was a real disconnect between what was happening publicly what the rest and I saw what was happening privately and actually want to play a little bit of an audio recording this is one of his former teammates testify to what he saw going on behind the scenes take a lesson\nThere would be swings where he'd be the most\nHyper masculine aggressive individual in the room where he'd be ready\nTo fight somebody in instead of rage or he'd be the most sensitive person in the room talking about cuddling with his mother or he'd asked me do you think I'm good enough to play\nSurvival and this was not an Aaron Hernandez that most as I got to see that your team went through hundreds of text messages audio recordings what's going on at his life at that time\nHis teammates knew about his volatile behavior and erratic behavior and potentially violent behavior and yet um they didn't reach the higher levels\nOn top of that the the the pictures are no never been forthcoming about what happened down there a Aaron Hernandez told coach Bill Belichick yucky just several months before he killed ... that he was afraid for the lives of his", "show_name": "PBS NewsHour", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "18"}
