set the latest on hurricane Michael and where it's headed over the next twenty four hours we're joined again tonight I can grant director of the national Hurricane Center and joins me from Miami, Florida\nGrand thanks for making the time tell us now we're talking to a little after five pm eastern what's the latest that we know that the strength and the intensity of the story\nYeah we got some brand new information that that just came in were looking at still winds of a hundred and twenty five miles an hour which is you know incredible since we're already inland so you still have some of those hurricane force winds\nYou know we're looking at a movement still about sixteen miles an hour or so it was speeding up all the time so luckily we're not getting some of those high rainfall told us but we are having some issues of course with the wind\nYou know being in like that we still expects hurricane force winds to stretch into central forces or Georgia so not just the coastal event you're going to get some trees down and some power outages even stretching into central Georgia\nTalking about this hurricane force winds even further inland the foreign made landfall a lot of people were talking about the worst case scenario store and if that's still the case where does most of the danger lie\nYeah you know a lot of it was you know of course the winds when you have a system that strong\nYou're you're going to have ones that are just absolutely destructive so I I think we once we start seeing some of the damage areas you'll see some of the structural damage collapsed buildings in and rooftops in trees down power rises for weeks\nBut what always scares me on these events without a doubt is the storm surge because it doesn't happen if a tallies in his tropical systems as the storm surge and if you look at water in general including the inland flooding you start getting Ninety percent of the ... so we've had some reports of some very large storm surge and these are the updated values we just have to be a little bit ago\nAnd you know you push all that water and with all that force in the hurricane force winds and it says every little channel every little river fills up well in some cases ten to Fifteen miles\nIt takes time it really takes a lot of times now that the wind relaxes it takes time to train all of that out there so the values are going to stay high\nThe water's always the most dangerous part of these\nAnd tell us about the past now where is the storm had\nYeah next we're looking at a continuing to to move to the to the northeast and if you think about this is interesting so at some point will continue to be a hurricane and eventually a tropical storm continuing to be a tropical storm out through the Carolinas and actually exiting back into the Atlantic so as a as an interesting case here\nYou know you think about the flow around um a Michael you have some onshore flow we actually have tropical storm warning even from from Georgia

out as they understand it and we're going to take a look at it is a terrible thing\nHave you spoken to the fatty I'd rather not say for the answer is yes\nWe take a deeper look at what this could mean for us and Saudi relations with Senator Chris Murphy a Democrat from Connecticut He sits on the Foreign Relations committee center thank you so much for joining us\nToday uh the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the ranking member and you have been working on a letter or that has just been released I Wonder if that letter say what kind of pressure you trying to put on the administration\nSo uh under existing a global human rights law passed by the Congress and signed by the president of the ranking Democrat and the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have the ability to ask the administration to come to a finding\nOn a potential gross violation of human rights abroad and that that's what this letter asks for the president to make a determination as to whether democracy hoagie was indeed executed by the Saudis as has been\nAlleged are now I think you have to take this letter with a grain of salt because it is asking the administration that has shown very little interest in getting to the bottom of this story\nTo come up with a definitive finding which they may be unlikely to do but at least it requires the administration to now go through a process by which they will have to do some facts finding a to discover a weather as we believe the Saudis executed this journalist\nThat process last about a hundred and twenty days or as I understand it do you expect or or perhaps do you hope that sanctions will be imposed on Saudi Arabia or to shows them that there are consequences if indeed democracy Yogi was murdered\nSo if those sanctions half to be triggered by a presidential finding then my expectations are low I I think the Trump Administration has not shown much interest in trying to\nFigure out what happened here and of course we know that\nThere is this a deep and unconditional bonds that has been created between the Trump Administration and the Saudi royal family that I imagine the administration is not going to be interested in breaking so if we are to impose sanctions or have some consequences for the potential murder of this journalist is\nProbably going to have to be Congress acting on its own so I'm Glad this process is taking place I was glad to sign a letter but I also don't have high expectations that the administration is going to trigger sanctions\nMisled or demands additional sanctions but do you think in the meantime or in addition the u._s. should for example cut off arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nI think it's time for us to cut off arms sales I'm I'll be honest I've argued that we should do that separate and aside from the allegations concerning this journalist um but we're going to have to send some signal in the short term\nThat the deliberate targeting of a journalist a U.S resident journalists is unacceptable\nIt may take a long time for the administration to work through a sanctions regime a week and take the immediate step or as Congress of suspending arms sales to the Saudis I think that that would be um I think that's worthy of discussion in the Foreign Relations committee and the upcoming days and weeks\nAssume out here to talk about the region that and us Saudi relations or the U.S minister rations priorities\nAre in the middle east started to counter Iran counter violent extremism to get to some kind of a temp for the Israeli Palestinian peace deal Saudi Arabia is critical for all those three things so why do you have some criticism administration for leaning on Saudi Arabia for using Saudi Arabia as the lynchpin across the region\nWell there's no doubt that Saudi Arabia has been key in creating a kind of taunting the region between the Sunni nations and Israel\nUm but on our other two objectives of the nature of the U.S Saudi alliance today is actually running counter to our state of goals in the region or by backing the Saudis play in Yemen for instance we're actually\nMaking Iran stronger or because the longer that civil war goes on to the deeper Iran gets involved\nIn the who the resistance there and we are actually helping of funds radical groups all around the world by continuing this alliance with the Saudis who\nQuietly funnel money to an intolerance brand of Islam ... that forms the building blocks of a lot of these Sunni extremist groups around the world so unfortunately I think the nature of our alliance with the Saudis actually runs contrary to many of our goals in the middle east\nI've asked any officials in front of a defense about the war in Yemen and they say that look you know Saudi Arabia isn't perfect of course there have been civilian casualty incidents inside Yemen but they are our ally we need to stand by them and they are on the same side\nAs us when it comes to Yemen do you believe that Saudi Arabia is on the same side and\nI don't think they're on the same side and I think that they've been misrepresenting the nature of the war inside Yemen they've been telling us that they're not trying to hit civilians when the evidence is true the contracts the evidence tells us that\nBunker ship ... D live stream by has said Jim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or freedom theater at the gym and a half dot com\nAnd I I think if if it turns out that they've been lying to us over the last few days about the murder of the show which\nI Would argue they probably have and then I think that's a further evidence to tell us that they are also not telling us the truth when it comes to the way in which targeting is conducted inside Yemen all the evidence tells us that they've been trying to hit civilian and they've been succeeding\nA and we should withdraw from our military partnership inside Yemen bigotry should never be part of any military campaign even if it's with a named ally in which civilians are the target\nSenator Chris Murphy a Democrat from Connecticut thank you very much thanks [noise]\n\n\nMaxim subject and energy production let's
