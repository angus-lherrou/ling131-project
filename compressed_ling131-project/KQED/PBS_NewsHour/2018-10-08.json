Bush looked on she and her new husband Craig coins will live in New York\nStill to come on the news hour on climate report forecasts a dangerous future unless action is taken the disappearance of a Washington Post journalist [noise] the next steps in working with North Korea to secure a nuclear deal much [noise]\nAs we reported earlier the inter governmental panel on climate change which is a consortium of climate scientists\nAnnounced today that if the world community doesn't reduce carbon emissions drastically millions of people across the planet will suffer dire consequences but as William rang and report heating that warning now is a daunting challenge\nThe UN's latest report put together by over Ninety authors and editors from over forty countries is probably ... most dire warnings yet about the severity of climate change and the cost of inaction\nReport says that unless the world's immediately begins reducing the burning of coal and oil and gas to drive up global temperatures\nThe world will suffer tremendous consequences by his earliest twenty forty just twenty two years from now the un says global food supplies will be threatened by increasing drought and heat waves\n... nations could be flooded by rising sea levels potentially triggering huge flows of refugees fear storms and wildfires will grow in intensity costing billions in damages lives lost\nTo keep even more drastic impacts at bay the un report urges the governments of the world to cut carbon emissions enough\nTo limit global warming to just one and a half degrees Celsius that's about to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nAbove pre industrial levels but that would take a near a revolutionary change and how the industrialized world creates electricity\nRoast food and move people and goods around\nThe un acknowledges the quote there is new documented historical precedent for the changes needed to prevent even worse disastrous from coming\nBecause I mentioned today's report is to date one of the strongest call to action\nAnd with me or to people who have spent their lives studying climate change and our responses to it re ... the senior policy fellow at the woods hole Research Center and chairman of Arctic Twenty one a network of scientists working to draw attention to the effects of warming on the Arctic\nAnd Gavin Schmidt is a climatologist and chief of NASA's Goddard Institute for space studies he's co founder also of the climate science blog real climate\nA gentleman welcome to both Gavin Schmidt to you first this report from the UN is to my reading an incredibly stark warning how do you read it\n[noise] basically this report is telling us things that scientists have known for a long time that climate change is already occurring and it really doesn't take very much more for it to become a very very serious issue or not just the coastal environments for agriculture for the sake of many many different aspects of the planet\nAnd this report is saying well you know if we want to limit this if we wanted to not get out of control or we need to act very very quickly in order to do that and the time for doing so is ...\nUm and I think what made him unusual was a ... you know he was willing to take these risks are\nFor himself including leaving the country are going into exile um\nAnd being a truth teller or because he had hopes that Saudi Arabia might really moving the right direction I should say has hopes and Saudi Arabia might move in the right direction and I'm a and he was trying to kind of be a positive voice pushing them in that direction\nYou referred to the risks that he took it he expressed concern for safety\nI don't think anybody are expected\nSomething or like\nThe worst of what is being speculated now but I think\nYou know when he left the country more than a year ago he said there are a lot of people in Saudi Arabia who can't speak the truth there in jail or they're being muzzled I have the opportunity or if I give everything up in my country to go out and continue to speak the truth I think he knew um\nPotentially relatives at risk it put a a you know not know exiles feels completely um\nSanguine um but\nAt the same time I don't think anybody would have expected or\nSomething like what we're most afraid of now\nI spoke with the state department earlier and all they would say is that we are closely following the situation is the U.S doing enough\nI think uh you know Jamal was a resident of the United states he was a columnist for the Washington Post that puts the United states government in a position to have both the basins and the obligation to demand answers if if it is true\nBeyond hope that it's not true\nForeign government lord one of its own citizens into one of its diplomatic properties on foreign soil and then had a murder\nIt's unprecedented in modern times we've never seen anything like that and there's no way it seems to me that Congress or in American administration could just go back to normal relations with the country\nOr an American administration could just go back to normal relations with a country that would do that so\nWe in ministry edition and Congress in our view should be asking for answers and asking for information and ah during\nA lot more loudly and system where than what we've heard so far\nFred hired at the Washington Post thank you very much thank you and joining me now is Robin Wright she writes the New Yorker magazine and if a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars Robin Wright thank you very much\nFor joining us you just heard for higher described how there should not be a normal us Saudi relationship if this\nIncident turns out to be true and we've heard bipartisan outrage from multiple senators are from multiple sides a of the ideological spectrum saying that there shouldn't be a break and us Saudi relations if this is true so\nUh is that possible is a kind of break between the U.S and Saudi Arabia possible\nI doubt it uh the fact that in Saudi Arabia is central to the Trump administration's policy in the middle east or Saudi Arabia was his first destination a as president there was a enormous pomp and ceremony when he arrived\nA Saudi Arabia is central to his attempt at a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians\nIs central to his counterterrorism program\nOr his own son in law was his chief advisor on the middle east is a very close personal friend of Mohammed bin ... on the crown prince who is on allegedly linked to the state of this wonderful Saudi\nUm critic and in my longtime French them all\nSo are the prospects of this change anything I think are unlikely the bigger question in some ways for Saudi Arabia is what impact does this have on foreign businesses looking to uh or had been thinking about investing in the kingdom\nOr that kind of big time money was is essential to the crown princes ambitious plans\nTo develop the kingdom to ... to diversify the economy the on the oil and there may be someone who will wonder about the legitimacy the commitment of the crown prince to genuine reforms given his track record since taking over last year\nSo given his need for some of those reforms given his need\nFor western investment or what does it say about Saudi priorities ... been so long\nI think mom and then someone has proven to be a quite ruthless when it comes to silencing his critics he talks about reforms for women and then he turns around after giving them the right to drive an interesting some of those who had been the most vocal on women's rights and one of them was recently sentenced to death\nThere are those who were the\nModerate clerics condemning and speaking out against Sunni extremism or Islamic extremism some of those many of those have been picked up and some of those have been sentenced to death\nAnd it's clear that there it as Jamal head off and said there is under the current leadership very little if any room for criticism or or questioning\nAnd very quickly Robin Wright a President Trump has criticized journalists he has praised authoritarians or does that kind of talk or have any impact on this event that we are talking about today\nI think the idea of human rights has generally not been very important in the Trump Administration and hasn't spoken out made it up and important part of its foreign policy on the fact that this is a journalist and criticizing our country in a leadership very close to the Trump Administration I doubt it will\nProduce any kind of immediate impact or significant impact\nRobin Wright thank you very much thank you [noise]\nDay with us coming up on the news hour it's politics Monday on the race for control of Congress author Michael Lewis on the critical mission of government and a tiny island at risk of seeing it's community and livelihood wash down but first the U.S\nSecretary of state visited North Korea yesterday to continue negotiations with the regime there over its nuclear program it is a process that has seen its ups and downs and as John Yang reports this is it produce some guarded optimism [noise]\nIt was all smiles around the table for a Sunday lunch in Pyongyang where North Korea's nuclear arsenal was the main menu items [noise]\nLeaders secretary of state Mike Pompeo reported significant progress in his talks with\nNorth Korean Supreme leader Kim Jong loon\nThe north state run television echoed that positive tone for the two sides agreed to establish working level talks on a second so much this week President Trump and Kim Pompeo also told reporters that the north agreed to allow inspectors a nuclear test site to North demolished last spring [noise]\nAdministration was expressing doubts decided actually been destroyed\nSick fried hackers former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory he's visited North Korea several times\nI've been so much skepticism about whether what the North Koreans did actually would make a difference or not or would it would make it easy for them to [noise] so it's a big deal actually let someone come in and\nTo evaluate whether that really set back the site that Michigan it's an important confidence building measure as far as I'm concerned\nPresident Trump's confidence is already running high you recently\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream by ... Jim presenting miss Saigon or new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November force at the gym or freedom theater at the gym at that dot com\nThe president's top advisors or remain more skeptical of shifting for talking twenty Seventeen of fire and fury to falling in love and stood there and just us sanctions will stay in place until the North's moves are gone\nChina supporters also critical for any North Korean nuclear disarmament\nBut maintaining Beijing support is complicated by growing trade war and other detention [noise]\nThat was clear today is from pill met with Chinese foreign minister warned me [noise]\nWe urge the United states to stop these kinds of is taken action believe China in the u._s. should stick to the correct passive cooperation [noise]\nTrying to draw side there's new framework for dismantling North Korea's nuclear arsenal but should treat her nose that Pyongyang has put aside for their nuclear testing testing\nMeans they will not be able to improve the creation of the nuclear weapons particularly but I Would be worried about is making the smaller or to continue to develop the hydrogen or sort of a nuclear bomb capabilities\nGenetic structure unclear including the possible timing of the ... the two leaders for the PBS NewsHour on John [noise]\nWith a larger issue of the ignorance\nOf the problem ignorance of the mission and as a result putting the wrong person it I mean there are a hundred and ... but I mean I think\nOne it's easily described is inside the department of agriculture there is a chief side and this person is responsible for distributing ... billion dollars in research grants every year now this\nFor distributing three billion dollars in research grants every year\nNow this is going to agricultural research most of it one way or the now associated with climate change how we're going to prison how we're going to continue to grow food and gray sheep and milk cows in different in a different climate and it's a serious issue with planning for them you know the food supply of fifty years from now [noise]\nThe person who was doing that was a a very distinguished research scientist agriculture is named Kathy ... she's a world class authority on the subject of agricultural science\nTrump replaced her with a right wing talk show radio host from ah from Iowa who happened to supported him in the election he had no science background at all that kind of thing taking people who really knows something and replacing them with people who are just loyalists who have absolutely\nNo idea what the mission is is a theme that runs right through the administration\nDoes the mission suffer I mean I I think obviously you could look it back to the transition and say that seems a drastic shifted priority but ... largely have a career staff that are there largely permanently I mean doesn't doesn't that staff keep the mission going for the most part\nSo of the top six thousand career civil servants in the federal workforce twenty percent of them quit or or were fired the first year or the ... so already there's like you can see a gutting of the civil service and the idea that these people are\nLazy or stupid or dead weight on the society is I think it's the most sinister idea alive in this country right now I really do and I think ... and it's because they are they're very mission driven people they're very knowledgeable people with money people uh\nAnd maybe they're not enough money for themselves yeah that's right you don't take the jobs to be famous rich and famous you taking jobs because you really care about to say\nAnd I'm there the government and without those people this place collapse this place being this society society\nIt's not like the government is a tool that we might use to address the biggest problems we have is the only tool for most of the biggest problem I mean we can deal with climate change that's going to be from the government is ... ... ... anything having\nTo do with science and technology all the basic research the very basic research is done with government [noise] through the government because\nIf it's not going to pay out and the next ten to Fifteen Years industry doesn't want to have anything to do with it the future is driven by what the government does and it has been in this country forever I mean you don't get the Internet that the government\nYou don't get the iPhone the government you know get GPS without the government we are drastically cheating the future when we beat the government the way we treat it it's not just drop I mean we've been doing this here for several decades\nJust playing with the idea that the government's the problem not the solution\nHe is just the ultimate expression of the problem I think of is like um records in his ... exquisitely important machine that we've allowed\nThrough our own neglect to accumulate rust over the decades and now he's come in with a sledgehammer and and yeah we're ... we don't pay attention\nIn the last third of the book you really talk about the the the centrality of government data and how important that is and there's a few passengers where you list\nA lot of ways in which the Trump Administration has been scrubbing its Web sites of data USDA was removing reports of farm animals being abused the consumer financial Protection Bureau removing reports of financial abuse\nSima removing data about electricity and water and Puerto Rico after the hurricane what is behind that\nAll the climate change their data across the right at the department of energy and and there's a there's a threat any way to the weather data being accessible\nIt is not ideological\nWhich it's being driven by narrow financial interests someone financial and someone has a business it's going to this going to be more profitable if this information is not available\nAnd so it's ... it's ranchers who want to be able to abuse animals or it's it's a it's a weather company it doesn't want the weather data publicly accessible because they wouldn't be able to sell it to people\nAfter talking with all of these different officials working within the is crucial agencies what is the thing that scares you the most what keeps you up\nWith a broad say in the processing is fantastic my ... of this moment we're going to look back and say there were many unless we draft which of course look back and say there were many moments\nWhere we cheated the future by by the way we behave in the present and I think that's ... that's been true for a while but I think it's really true right now the book is the fifth risks Michael Lewis thank you so much for having me [noise]\nAnd finally and I look at a place right here in the United states where scientists say the effects of climate change our planes to see John Yang traveled ten year island in the Chesapeake Bay a tiny speck of land that is shrinking as a sea level rises [noise]\nThe sun is barely up the Waterman of tangy Virginia have already been out on the Chesapeake Bay for hours one after another boat shuttle back and forth to the islands tiny harbor carrying their delicious cargo\nChesapeake blue crab switch thrive in these waters the provided a livelihood for generations of residents on just a bit of modern marsh twelve miles from shore\nI'm a commercial ... commercial forever ... or follow as a crab or a grandfather great grandfather\nAsk where the mayor of tangy are known to every one by his childhood nickname ... like the other four hundred six years so residents will be island says life is defined by the water we harvest for as fish oysters\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth that the U.S say Chen or freedom theater at the gym and death dot com\nSeeing tangiers very existence\nIt's ironic to the Chesapeake Bay over the years have provided a living for the folks here and now it's the Chesapeake Bay that is threatening the island is threatening to uh take it away while\nTangy around with has been shrinking for centuries battered by the ... relentless waves scientists say the problem is accelerating\nFolks here say this kind of title\nFlooding is an unusual after a big nor'easter like the one that just blew through because it pushes all the water up from the east but some fear this could be a glimpse into the future for tangiers island\nThe Army Corps of engineers estimates tangiers lost nearly two thirds of its land mass since Eighteen fifty that's about fourteen hundred acres if nothing is done scientists say it may have to be abandoned in the not too distant future\nIt's a traumatic and places\nEarl Swift first came to change here in two thousand he returned in twenty Fifteen and spent fourteen months researching his new book Chesapeake requiem a detailed portrait of the distinctive community he said the changes in the intervening years were striking\nHouse there's just a lot less island the western end of the vote channel\nIs Seventy five wider than it was one of those here Big Ten years ago now the uninhabited marsh island that forms the northern third of ten year I was a pretty solid expansive\nOf Mars today it's a loose macrame of ... you know strands of marsh\nJust parked all throughout with water\nThe dire fate of the island runs through swift narrative at its core though it's a look edits people\nA community a out at the edge of the American experience that really helped define the breath of that experience I'm a place that are unique is worth the server used today it's like a place that is truly unique\nIt's a place so isolated virtually all residents are descended from the first settlers who arrived\nIn Seventeen Seventy eight the crowded cemeteries are filled with parts per se and crackers their Victorian version of the Methodist religion still permeates the community alcohol was not sold here and signs of faith are everywhere even ... water tower\nYou'll never want to do with the low slung before then there's the tangiers dialect it echoes\nThe speech of their ancestors who came from the south western coast of England all coming\nThe isolation has also fostered and unusually strong bond among its residents\nI did not understand how different the sense\nOf community the meaning of community is here to reach the rest of America requires effort and time and and at certain times of the year or a certain amount of danger\nTalk of the Iowans future is hard to avoid\nIt's a preoccupation that never leaves their entire lives were tied up in\nIslanders want a seawall to surround tangy here but with a thirty million dollar price tag the Army Corps of engineers says it would be cheaper simply to move every one to the mainland [noise]\nA lot of folks myself included
