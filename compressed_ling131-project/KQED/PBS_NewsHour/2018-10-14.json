public defender right\nI did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating from law school and what was\nWhat was your idea behind it you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise] that's right and I like lots of people had no idea what was going on and I'm a little system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined a criminal defense connected and why you and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise]\nWhat I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes project [noise] um and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on at the public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts\nIs deeply deeply defined by class and by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nLike definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities [noise] here's more from rubbish diverted on the edge and you know\nI'm not a hundred that the fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America I'm\nIs addicted to imprison us from slavery to laugh at ... it always has that we all know the shocking numbers the United states incarcerate more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know if that on any given night and America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cells who had not been inducted anything these mothers and\nAnd sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nPrice ... whole male\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount um in their own discretion\nI have seen it as low as a hundred dollars\nFor the people that we represent and the clients that we see bail is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't have got an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system\nCisco dot com slash go slash Jews Web acts and European sleep parks the story that bases its design and

I'm Guy Raj\nAnd on the show today ideas about hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen was that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven was to\nHave you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing it's a legal thing and\nSo books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing these great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things now\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car these great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called ...\nOr more legal rights at one time it was in that defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men\nWho were actually Freeman or persons slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now no all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons baking is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how that works\nSo a person and things are both in terms of art\nAnd and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who goes into these are\nSo for example in the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights in national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive status or broadening the definition of legal persons to include animals or ethnic hides he's been dedicated to for nearly ... years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer\nNow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of last brown hair and and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because on one that's for the voiceless defended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless in defense was that billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals is that your side is trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal persons now at that time\nThere was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on when I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream that\nWas my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success them so much have to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal\nRights to animals [noise] came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart broad James Somerset to London and\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptize\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because the Eighteenth century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the anti marry that was to set the effort to make that were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who was chief judge of the quarter kings bench and demanded that issue a common law written of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the dictator is required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSummers that was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if he could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume without deciding\nThat James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain the ship there were a series of hearings of the next six months on July twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was odious [noise] that the common law would not support\nIn the order James Frey at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate the free\nMan who walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walk then but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that of course a non human version of Jamestown resent us\nGets worse and James his body was brought in by the captain to ship there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious [noise] that the common law would not support\nIn the order James Frey had that moment James Summers that underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man who walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slave would walk that it but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James summer said of course the nonhuman version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James summer since I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition\nOf chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous things that they are conscious that they are self conscious that\nThey can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on we filed\nA hundred and sixty pages of affidavits\nAnd we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against\nEvery idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nFor ... a day comes from Cisco presenting the Web backs meetings used by

the show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make involuntary once you've sent out ten thousand lettuce to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population and actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much ah increased you would then\nFor those who were still interest in that you would do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you're actually match the demographic profile for countries and making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime ...\nTo me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bounce ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if\nOnly the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John how some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry a contract is God's for the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams who talked with us it's just I just got my dog goes out I'm saying are the people who want political power as specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people to all three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected in fact there's a\nA regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah pollen in the world to instigate a one\nElected chamber in one solution chamber once with fish and buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busily back stabbing each other and engaging and the two people political out place and go well why do we need that for his chain but uh but this is a path to old is the ideal\n\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these parliaments try this side of your friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nRely jerky wife my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these Monday examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be the perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have out strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assembly UK Government is now putting aside almost a million pounds\nTo a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see the wood is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second\nThey're being for example a U.S state legislature with the second buddy selected by solution that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately you'd say huge surely a meal battle to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try to us\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not ... or those who could have baby a political changes every easy or especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to I don't either I don't try something new out to be tough systems burgers and unknown to see a change\nRed headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas about hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is\nThis is the fact Mario he's a legal advocate business philosopher ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to do together\nWhat do we are one another where do we want to go together in law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of the thing that translate between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between facts in arms but that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge gap oftentimes people who need those were the most have never even heard of them and um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken or both\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law\nAnd the people here say like Mario on the head stage\n[noise] probably tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none the\nRubbish

wouldn't need to buy any would\nHe said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing them to decided to use the last means of protest he thought he had
