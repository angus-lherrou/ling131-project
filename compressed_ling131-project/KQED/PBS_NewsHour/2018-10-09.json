half of the country or whatever I Do agree now the United states is respected countries may not like\nI said that's what we do know that if we say we're going to do something we fall when the president for that\nAnd outside the White House more sex from secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nHas been a great partner by for that now five months that she had I had been working together uh and I want to wish her very well\nFrom the beginning Haley was well respected by many un diplomat well covered by the media and embrace President Trump's foreign policy and combative for those that don't have our back or taking names [noise]\nTo trumpeted the U.S embassy move to Jerusalem and the U.S any education and humanitarian support for Palestinians and when a hundred and twenty eight countries voted their disapproval she once again warned she was taking names\nUnited States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the general assembly\nOr raunchy reflecting Trump

Iran's fingerprints all over it\nFoaming at the now suffering in Boston\nAnd on Russia She criticized Moscow's deport for Syrian president Bashar al Assad especially after an April twenty Seventeen chemical weapons attack\nHow many more children have to die before Russia cares\nThat's where she reflected the foreign policy establishment antipathy to Russia over President Trump's positive

we have a very close working relationship\nA weird SARS tells the many occasions collaborating together on how we would deal with certain issues\nThat collaboration started when former secretary of state rex Tillerson's ineffectiveness allowed her to become a hype\nFormer secretary of state rex Tillerson's ineffectiveness allowed her to become a high profile voice of Trump's foreign policy\nBut then Tillerson was fired and she didn't get the job for ... did in John Bolton became national security advisor for wings were caught that's when she says she first told the president she wanted to resign and when she got out over skeet announcing rushing sanctions that never came\nYou will see that Russian a sanctions will be coming down\nBut that announcement never came and top economic adviser Larry Kudlow called Haley confused she shot back she doesn't get confused despite that dust up as she had for the last few years Haley remain in the president's good graces even though in twenty sixteen she campaign for one of his main rivals Florida Senator Marco Rubio\nThe Jewish jokes that South Carolina makes presidents and our next president will be\nReady to President Trump's criticism of her was always tempered ... woman she said I'm an angry person and there's just me you are an angry person I saw I said I\nI'm very angry because I have what's happening to our country I Am\nHaley assumed and conveyed that anger at the un White House officials describe her as overly political but on policy she reflected the president's style and ... our mixture\nAnd joining me now is our White House correspondent now Michele cinder so you need so many people are asking why is Nikki Haley doing this now she said personal reasons term limits but what else do we know about what's happening here\nWhat we know is that Washington was really really shocked when Nikki Haley made this announcement\nAnd it's because our news our news our producers here than in the last the last Thirty years of un ambassadors and an almost every single case when that person resigned in the middle of a president's term if they were taking another job and then ... that is not the case with Nikki Haley I spoke with someone\nWho's close to Nikki Haley who was who also help get our elected in South Carolina that person since she's very politically ambitious and a good way and that she wouldn't no one to leave and in this case she's leaving one the maturation is having a good couple of weeks they had Brett Kavanaugh confirmed that trade deal went through you\nAlso have the the economy doing well so Nikki Haley is kind of reading on this high there is of course this idea that she could run and twenty twenty with Nikki Haley was very from today she said she's not running and twenty twenty and he's actually going to help President Trump campaign so she's throwing her support behind the president um but that's pretty much where people are talking about today\nWell we heard a in next report that the president was complimenting hurt today she was complimenting him how it is her leaving compared to the departure of other high level a Trump Administration officials there have been a few and what do we know about who might take her place well\nNikki Haley's announcement is very abnormal because it was so normal there's this idea that in the Trump Administration when people have left it's usually been because of scandal and they've been fired via Twitter just a couple of list there's every one I was invited on Twitter um are some of the people are state of secretary of state Rex Tillerson\nSecretary of veteran affairs David Shulkin then you have former FBI Director James Comey who was fired as he was making the FBI agent there with and then there was the whole scene of the motorcade being followed by a news chopper because everyone was so shocked\nThat scandal that secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price\nAnd eat the Amish ratio environmental protection agency\nThey were both fired or resigned because of ethical concerns um all that being said the president said there are many many names um of people who could be people that would that would replace Nikki Haley he's floating the idea floated the idea of a bunker Trump even though she tweeted very quickly I Am not going to be the next\nUN ambassador there's also Dina power she's the former White House and deputy of national security she someone who's very well regarded but really we're going to have to wait and see Judy\nBunker Trump his own daughter but he had mentioned today there might be a nepotism charge around that All right and fascinating today and Nikki Haley leaves at the end of the year and they will send a thank you thanks [noise]\nOr other major story tonight as hurricane Michael is roaring toward the Florida Panhandle and rapidly growing into a major threat landfall is expected tomorrow possibly near Panama City and a hundred and eighty thousand people are now under evacuation orders\nSo far Florida Alabama and Georgia and declaring emergencies William ... takes it from their\nJudy in advance of hurricane Michael the president today approved an emergency declaration for Florida that authorizes federal assistance for preparations and disaster relief\nFor more on this storm I'm joined now by ten ground director of the national Hurricane Center based in Miami Mr ... thank you very much for being here to just give us the latest on this storm\nWould just have the latest information and and now we're a category three wins a hundred and twenty miles an hour with a system so some strengthening as as forecasts were already about two hundred and Seventy miles south south west about electrical a\nMoving north of twelve miles an hour you can see a very healthy system what the I in the center of some some construction so really looking at a system that that is large and you're already starting to see some of these rain barrels work their way north word in the Gulf of Mexico\nIt was almost like a normal day except for the fact that there was a new face on the bench and justice cabin on now sits at the extreme right and the bench as you face it is a right next to him is Justice Kagan who actually was an Obama appointed justice\nUh it it was a normal day ah he asked I counted about eight questions during two hours of argument in two cases\nAnd his delivery was very ah professional straightforward much as he's been described when he sat on the appellate court and right before the argument I he actually seem happy to be there he was chatting and laughing with a Justice Kagan\nHis family his wife and two daughters were sitting in special seats that are for guests of the justices a ... a Justice Kennedy who had sworn him in a second time last night at the White House also attended what\nAbout marshal the cases that are coming up expected to come up this this term for the court are they the kinds of cases where we maybe can look for some momentous precedent and breaking a decisions on the part of the court\nSo right now the docket is very low key in terms of the cases that they've agreed to hear and decide but that could actually change next week in fact it could even change this week uh in the wings right now are cases involving whether our national ... a job anti discrimination law\nProtects against sexual orientation discrimination there are two cases involving Medicaid funding cut off by states\nFor Planned Parenthood clinics\nA there is a case involving a World War one memorial cross on public land which also these are all flash point kinds of cases\nAnd just today it looks as though the a case involving whether there's to be a citizenship question on the census is coming to the court very quickly\nSo yes there they're going to be many challenges I think down the road there's so much more in the pipeline to the court involving the Trump Administration that really will test the court uh in terms of whether they can find consensus in and not appear partisan this new course\nThey can find consensus in and not appear partisan this new court just getting underway with a knife justice sitting there and are shifting time Marcia Coyle watching it all yes for sure interesting thank you my pleasure Judy [noise]\nFour weeks from tonight the news hour political team will join me here at this desk to cover the mid term elections well we'll find out which party controls the U.S house of representatives and the Senate for the next few years\nOne of the most closely watched races in North Dakota which many Republicans think hold their best shot at taking over a Senate seat now held by a Democrat\nI travel there this past weekend for a close up look [noise]\nThe place to be this Sunday in southeastern North Dakota was the annual day festival tiny rotten one celebrating its Scandinavian route [noise] skiing on brash a kid tries to rain and the highlight of great\nAttractive young and old and the two candidates in one of the most competitive races for a U.S Senate seat this fall\nYou notice all the Norwegian flags [laughter] there's no reason to doubt it\nI mean Democrat Heidi Heitkamp the only high level member of her party left in a state that for years sent mostly Democrats to Washington it in the bull's eye of a Republican drive to hang onto its majority in the U.S Senate standards of bonus sweets Democrats out of power here\nThey just couldn't keep up with where North Dakota was going and so I Can't maybe the last movie I don't know\n[noise] taking her on his Republican Kevin Cramer North Dakota's only member of the U.S house and an enthusiastic backer of President Trump\nSaying\nIf Mr President thank you for not forgetting all at one\nOnly two states in the country have a smaller population than North Dakota and it's fair to say most Americans are familiar with the name of its major city only because of a movie\nEven so it is this state that is poised to be the biggest determinant this fall and whether Democrats have a chance of retaking control of the U.S Senate\nHike camp like other red state Democrats up for reelection this year often reminds voters of her independent how much he works across party lines\nThere too many people who only vote on one side one hundred percent of the time and that'll never be needing\nIn her case she's not only voted with President Trump more than half the time she was one of a tiny number of Democrats mentioned for a job and his administration\nBut when the Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court came up she voted against a move shorter please her base voters\nThis is an issue of conscience just as an issue of judicial temperament and taking the hyper partisan executive branch the hyper partisan legislative branch that make up part is important I think that is absolutely the wrong direction [noise]\nShe was concerned enough about how her vote would go over that she caught up paid ad about it for ...\nHonestly I don't think he told the truth and even if he did he showed himself to be true biased to be impartial\nAs a house member Kramer didn't have a vote but which for Kavanaugh from the start you had to clarify his views after he told a reporter that nothing happened to blobs before\nI started with the premise that it really did have and that's I think the allegations are true we're obviously series clearly here's something very traumatic often to\nI don't know what it is\nTo women voters we spoke to in Fargo this weekend told us their view is closer to Kramer's\nI just [noise]\nClinical motives there have a hard time with something that happened so long ago [noise]\nYou know like we've been down and made the stakes in the past\nBut one person in a crowded Sundays festivities in Rockland jet Heitkamp handled it just right\nTo be more but\nSo did Vanessa ... whom we met at her family's farm near cold facts\nIt's probably strengthens my ideal of what Heidi's stands for because whether he was guilty or not he proved himself to be not judicial and very partisan\nSo the trucks coming down the driveway ran park right here I'm right here\nKumar hasn't even stronger reason to support high camp her opposition to President Trump's get tough trade policy toward China which China responded to by ending its purchase of us soybeans one of\nNorth Dakota's main farm exports the result has been drastic losses for soybean farmers here\nWell it's basically been shut down for a\n... a good one of tens of thousands of soybean farmers in North Dakota we're feeling the effects of the trade war with China\nThe combine will come across and\nUh-huh Cheryl love us and her husband oversee eight thousand acres in Hillsboro half of which are soybeans\nWere really feeling the effects here in North Dakota savings has become a very big crop for here and in this geography and on our own farm China major customer of ours we miss having the opportunity to sell her being to them they've been great customers over the years sampling over there to\nLove us estimates their losses alone could run to almost two hundred thousand dollars this year meaning they can't grow their business as they plant\nWere actually thinking about getting another\nSponsorship of the ... the live stream bike has said Jim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November for that the state you an or freedom theater at the gym at death dot

market and one year losing it\nWe already know that China is picking their\nTheir market down from twenty percent in terms of what they see their hobby down to twelve percent ... says that he was against the idea the terrible that for that convenience doesn't crime against terrorists but it's okay if the president in ... there are some kind of double taught that you get to Washington DC but doesn't work so well in North Dakota\nKramer says now that President Trump is moved against the Chinese the U.S cannot backed down if\nWe don't stick to our guns now China can break the United states which is what some politicians seem to be cheering for then we will never be able to negotiate a good deal with China again\nAnd then he held up here say being to\nLove us who identify as conservative so she hasn't decided how she's voting in November but has a clear message for everyone in Washington\nWhat I Am hoping is that all of our elected officials remember that we as farmers in this out here\nI think there is concern for farmers in both dealing with the Democrats and the Republican uh that you know hey don't don't forget it we're we're here\nEver why do you think there hasn't been more progress from uh the best one side of the picture which is a challenging of course uh\nOf the picture which is a challenging of course a in is a challenge brought us the other side of the picture shows progress\nOr in the life of the citizens and the economy the new generation\nNature Keisha services private sector different if men to independent there isn't more progress is the fact that the security is still is a challenge and then it absorbs most of the sources of energy and the time\nAbout a year ago President Trump announced new south Asia strategy\nMy original instinct was to pull out and historically I like following my instincts\nPresident Trump has expressed skepticism about keeping troops in Afghanistan do you think the strategy is sustainable\nTo make it work is of course parts of it is progress inside the country as with all these as well as the citizens of that country or in part of it is the cooperation from the region\nWhich share a destructive she has very regional aspect and at that and other parts of it is dealing with the centuries so you just use the word sanctuary or you're friendly with them a yes or that to a part of the the issue\nA remains to be settled and impediment I challenge the U.S has spent seven hundred and fifty billion dollars on security in Afghanistan and a hundred and twenty five million on reconstruction those of us who live in Afghanistan I Know that it's\nNot about the money but it has been Seventeen years why do you believe that this strategy can succeed where the last Seventeen years of strategy hasn't produced results that were promised Deborah\nDetection engagement and not off was run detracts\nAnnouncement of a withdrawal in two thousand ten thousand which can be taken out of uncertainty ah that was another ... or\nA distraction and to that effect that the security situation the comic situation and also the calculus of friends in pools are towards a a ... a dish out behind us now\nThe this facility on the shoulders of our students who forces mainly security of defense for says that's a big shift\nSo that means that to us as not\nHaving the same ... on his shoulders I used to\nAnd what about commitment from\nSenior off guns to the United states there have been some prominent political figures and parliamentarians recently as you know who question the utility the bilateral security agreement between Afghanistan and the United states does that signal an erosion of trust in NATO and the United states on the outcome but\nI Will say that to consider that does the birth of freedom of speech\nOr the or did was a meeting or does it get to hear that from under the book was sent some political leaders I Wish I did on which had develop their own opinion opinions in the past few years\nI based on different reasons I times for example when we have civilian casualties as there there's a lot of military operations people are upset\nThe you don't expect those parties which have given losses to come and please all of us including gas in the government\nThe U.S has begun talks with the Taliban about future peace negotiations have you seen any evidence the Taliban is serious about this round of talks more serious perhaps and they have been about previous from a veteran\nNeeds to be seen Taliban so far has not top notch on\nReal intentions\nAre from time to time different disadvantaged in some contacts with talks a man didn't use it for ... for ... purposes to which were not the purpose of those meetings are those those contacts the pressure on Taliban inside that on the stump should continue military security what's\nA and to outside the fun of some sort of this you're cheap they should feel pressure\nThere used to be a lot more pressure on them because we used to be a hundred thousand us troops so why would they come to the table and speak directly to you the Afghan government which is what the us is asking for when they wouldn't in the past\nNow Taliban doesn't have the same excuse as did was use and because they are facing\nThe African forces which are the African Union forces were non existent\nA Seventeen years back parts of the strategies to double the size of a come on divorces rich off it picked up ... says the Airforce or decided to keep you believe he's which will have which will enable us to sue\nDo track and want us to protest our citizens\nA second one is to find out whenever there is an opportunity for\nTalks in negotiations sees it and and to capitalize on the\nPresidential elections in April will you be running with a President Ghani or against him\nHer dad has a solid commitment in my power to to have the unity government sanctioned\nAnd Tim the last day of its mandate to down with to present the news stuff to an option for me in the same token the kind of conduct\nAnd today you're in the United states but to your message to U.S officials you're making less than two American viewers might still be skeptical about\nUh the use of made a big investment\nImpeach in fact\nAnd stupidity of a part of the world [noise] ah my ... to to get aid for a ... off people also have made big sacrifices are too good to

from the creators of Les Miserables October night to November for the region or freedom theater at the gym and dot com [noise]\nOn our bookshelf tonight presidential historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin on leadership in turbulent times I sat down with a recently and again our conversation by asking how she came up with the idea for this hurt eight book\nWhen I began at five years ago there was a feeling that Washington was broken that bipartisanship had been lost\nAnd I decided I Want us to look back at other presidents my guys are specially I call them that because I've lived with them for so long when they had gotten to more challenging times even than ours and yet somehow were able to pull the citizens and the leaders bond together to make the country better and then it got even more turbulent as time went on\nOne of the first thing I noticed when I look at the book on the back cover you have a positive comments I called them blurbs from Warren Buffett and Jim Collins who's known for the book and good to great these are business people um does that tell us this is a different kind of history books\nAt one point I was speaking to a lot of business groups over these last couple of decades but also to colleges and universities and the kids raised his hand and said\nHow can I ever become one of these guys they're on Mount Rushmore it's too hard to become them\nSo I thought what if I write about them when they first start to run for office when they're twenty three and twenty five and twenty eight\nAnd when they're still on formed in when they're gonna make mistakes and when they're going to screw up things then maybe young people can aspire to be leaders I Would just love it if more people in this country went into public life went into leadership positions because that's what we need right now\nAnd of course before you choose to focus on is Abraham Lincoln Teddy Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson used the term screwing up and you do focus in the book on the problems they face early in their lives one was an important people who've\nBeen through difficult times in their lives to adversity and come through with resilience that the strength and the wisdom they've learned from their mistakes they've learned from what fate my deal them\nI mean Lincoln had a near suicidal depression when he felt like he had broken his word to his constituents is broken his promised to marry that he get married to her and they have to take on knives and racism citizens from his room but he comes out of\nBy saying I Would just assume die now but I've not yet accomplished anything to make any human being remembered that I have lived incredibly right Teddy Roosevelt loses his wife and his mother on the same day in the same house he goes to the badlands he writes his horse Fifteen hours a day but by being in the west you absorbs this love of nature\nAnd it becomes a Westerner as well as an Easterner FDR of course has with polio and when he took up that rehab center in Warm Springs\nAnd he was doc Roosevelt to his fellow polio patients you taught them how to live again a life of joy even if they were paralyzed exactly what he was able to do the country when the country has paralyzed LBJ has a massive heart attack when he's on the top of the heap as majority leader but he says what if I died now\nWhat would I be remembered for and then he goes right for civil rights in the Senate goes ride for civil rights and the president said so something happens I think when you go through a hard time you come to it with resilience\nA really important quality for doesn't have to be as harrowing as these guys had but it has to be something\nYou describe the adversity but is there some secret sauce some some magic formula that we should learn from what they went through because that's what some people look at this and I said I Want to know what is what's the magic formula\nThere's no magic trick in fact there's no clear trajectory for any of them to reach the top of the presidency", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PBS NewsHour", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "09"}
