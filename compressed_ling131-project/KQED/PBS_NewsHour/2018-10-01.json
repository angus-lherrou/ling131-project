you was quote a heavy drinker in college\nHe also said Kavanaugh at times became belligerent and aggressive one drunk President Trump was question today about what would happen if investigators find evidence that Kavanaugh lied under oath\nCertainly if they find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I Am a very open mind\nIn the meantime debate on Kavanaugh's nomination resumed this afternoon on the Senate floor was\nWe all saw something about judge Kavanaugh's temperament and character that day that should disqualify him from serving on the Supreme Court of the United states he was angry he was illiterate he must partisan he went on the attack\nAgainst senators questioning him these qualities we look for in a Supreme Court justice for a judge for that matter\nFor law judgment the pattern of behavior was saying confirmed for Democrats all public statements up till\n\nThey're committed to delay obstructing a resistor a list of all the notion was over they ... they just want to ...\nThe Senate is expected to vote on Kavanaugh nomination shortly after the FBI wrapped up its investigation\nAnd you may shift here with me now you makes you heard the president expressed support for judge Kavanaugh he also said he has an open mind for him and his support for his candidate\nThe White House currently is standing very very firm with Brett Kavanaugh for president gave a very vigorous defense of him\nUm and the White House today was sending out statements from Brett Kavanaugh as friends and former classmates that yeah they all say that Brett Kavanaugh did not blackout drunk when they weren't when they knew him these uncles or that he treated women very respectfully but that of course in direct contrast with other yell classmates of Brett Kavanaugh who say that he did get very drunk and then he was very aggressive\nAll that's happening while the president vocal saying that he doesn't want to look at any people I'll isn't want to look at any replacement but we all know that there is a long list of people that hate that the president put out of about maybe ten names of people who could possibly be other people that he would nominate so I just out there at the president has that the other thing that's really important as\nThe president said that he was very surprised but how local Brett Kavanaugh was about his drinking and the president made sure to note that himself and never even drink a beer and that's again showing that Brett Kavanaugh was a very different person that Donald Trump who's older brother friday Trump died in his forties\nFrom alcoholism so there's a real personal connection there with President Trump and drink and drink and I could open up the door\nObviously no one knows where the investigation is going to go but we know the White House first indicated it should be limited that now seems to be broadening a that still how involved is the White House it actually setting parameters for what the FBI looking into\nWell it's clear that the White House wants to be small and it wants to be quick\nAll that said President Trump really has the power to do whatever he wants to do in terms of of the FBI up and talking to sources who say\nThe FBI is in the executive branch and the president and within his authority to say you need to talk to these two women and that's it\nAnd today at the press conference he was pretty clear with the fact that he thought ... and Dr fortunately the people at the FBI should be focused on but all with all that his hand is really being forced by Jeff Flake and other Republicans who say look\nThe FBI needs to be able to do its work so this afternoon the FBI was given the the authority by the White House to really talk to anyone at the necessary and that means that they can be looking at\nBrett Kavanaugh was not just in conversations about sexual misconduct and other allegations but that he could actually be talking about little live\nThere are some people have pointed out the front Kavanaugh said he had no connection to yell when in fact his grandfather went to yell and he was elected the student\nYou know it's worth pointing out if we take a step back here this nomination was full steam ahead not too long ago and now it's mired in at the very least uncertainty right or maybe some ... blocks in the week ahead what do we know about how the president is watching all of this unfold\nThe president and fuming and he's calling senators everyday basically saying we control the Senate the Republicans control the Senate why in the world can't we just push the ... through\nAnd essentially the president wants to look at the Republicans and say why can't you do that I mean as a result he really doing what he's doing watching TV really really boating an angry about the fact that this hasn't gone through but at the end of the day the president has really only certain things you can do he could nominate somebody but he has to wait on the Senate to really do that so I can I go back to the idea that\nWhile the White House and saying they're standing with Brett Kavanaugh there is that list out there of other people and the president said I'm going to look at what the FBI are doing and then I'll figure out what happens next we\nFollow it from here you Michelle send are on the story for us ... now a step back from the politics of this particular FBI pro and a closer look at what might be happening with the investigation outside of the public eye\nFrank Montoya worked in various roles during his twenty five years at the bureau including sense leading the FBI Seattle and Honolulu divisions he joined me today from salt\nThe FBI Seattle in Honolulu divisions he joins me today from Salt Lake city they might tell you thank you for being with us I Want to ask you about the scope of what the FBI could be looking into right now to me a little bit about what FBI investigators wouldn't be doing an investigation like this right now well\nFirst and foremost we'd be talking to as many people as they can I think it was important that the doors were open a ... earlier this afternoon in terms of what and who they can pursue in in in the pursuit of\nOf information in and keep in mind this is the background investigation not so much a criminal investigation so it's not about proving who did what it's more about finding or disapproving or are not finding derogatory information\nSo there'll be talking to a among others are you Deborah Ramirez\nA doctor for the mark judge on some of these others that have been identified publicly as individuals who may have information it could also extend to individuals who are former classmates at Yale who can talk about more than just a potential sex or sexual assaults but\nYou know his his drinking habits or his other kinds of behaviors\nOr perhaps when he had drank too much so that there are a lot of people that they can talk to and those people can tell them about others that they can then follow up with\nYou mentioned that word derogatory explains means ... is that in terms of what kind of question the FBI investigators are asking when they talk to these people\nYeah another great question because again this is about determining if this individual is suitable for the job\nOf for which he has been nominated for they're going to look at character they're going to look at a associations are going to look at his reputation\nOf loyalty to the United states not to an individual\nUh biases or potential biases or ability to do the job\nAnd then of course a financial abilities alcohol and drug abuse of potential for alcohol and drug abuse you know when when I was a brand new agent gosh in January of Nineteen Ninety One we learned how to do these things and they taught us that the the acronym to help remember the kinds of things that we're supposed to talk about was Carla beef fat\nYou know and and that was what thirty or twenty seven years ago and I still remember it\nYou know we heard the president earlier asked about this as well whether or not he thought judge Kavanaugh himself should be interviewed that the FBI need to talk to judge Kavanaugh or just a complete ...\nAnother great question and whether it's Kavanaugh war is Dr Ford you know there's all kinds of of publicly available testimony that can be reviewed for a potential lead information\nBut again I think this is really about determining whether or not there is more derogatory information out there talking to him about that is is not going to get them there talking to folks like Dr Ford or Deborah ... sweating Nick\nThat's where the rubber meets the road in the background investigation now another thing that I Would add is that you know if somebody has information and they haven't been spoken to yet that they are by all means freedom to call the FBI or to go to an all the local field office in provide that information\nAnything and everything about this matter will be considered and reported\nWhere you can imagine there must be people who knew him in some capacity or the other African school if I'm a professional life who maybe getting exactly what you suggested that reaching out to their local FBI off as just the FBI I have an obligation to try to speak to every single one of those people to try to see this through\nWell and and that's a big challenge in this particular investigation because there are on a time crunch they have seven days so they're pretty limited in in you know in terms of what they do they have the resources to do it but you know there's been a lot of talk about how this is the seventh background investigation that Kevin us face\nThe fact of the matter is most of these investigations when when they are conducted there based on information that the candidate\nFor the job or the clearance provides to the FBI you know when we learn about derogatory information it's usually from records check or from somebody who heard that we were talking to somebody about an individual and then they come forward and provide that information because\nTypically when an individual fills out their SF eighty six they're not going to list references or we're gonna talk badly about some\nYou mentioned as previous investigation and this comes up again and again for our supporters that judge Kavanaugh it begs the question how they none of this information come up in any of that its previous crowds\nAs as I mentioned when when folks fill out their F. F. eighty six they're listing who they want us to talk to\nBut also a near majority believe that there's a smear campaign against judge Kavanaugh\nAny America is conflicted here just pulling like that do when we're about to go to an election when does it tell us about ...\nI think what we learn from this hearing is that Americans are as polarized on this issue at they are about pretty much any other issue in that play in finance and whether you're a Democrat or Republican your decision on how you feel about that is driven as much bipartisan ... than\nKnow about this is driven as much by your partisanship than almost anything else that I pulled that I saw over the weekend\nOr by the uh the folks that Huffington Post and ... found that again not surprisingly men who supported Donald Trump overwhelmingly said that they could identify with what Brett Kavanaugh was going through women who voted for Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly said that they identified with Christine Blasey Ford\nBut I think fundamentally the question about who does it who's going to help or hurt in the mid term elections right democratic candidates Republican candidates is this about the enthusiasm advantage\nI think we have to remember a couple of things the first is in twenty sixteen we know that the Supreme Court was a big issue for Republican voters\nAnd the thinking among a lot of Republicans was this is how Donald Trump won a skeptical Republican voters held their nose they didn't really like Trump but they want to the Supreme Court this year all the polling that I've seen thus far since the hearings took place at so at this moment\nWe're seeing increased democratic enthusiasm higher than what a Republican I'm On the issue of the Supreme Court how important the issue is for their vote\nAnd finally I think when all is said and done the issue that drives the selection is still going to be Donald Trump how do you feel about Donald Trump is going to be much more important in determining your vote and that how you feel about this hearing\nTown you know Democrats now you heard him he's talking about this earlier are raising more and more questions about did Brett Kavanaugh lie last week and they're raising questions about his drinking habits for example were seen witnesses who support what he says a counterweight at those who say no he was just kind of a drink or not\nIt doesn't change in democratic strategy both on this confirmation and politically\nThat there has been a shift in what people are focusing on um it's not clear whether this was a strategic shift or not but certainly there is more focused on whether he was truthful in his testimony and the area where there's no question about his truthfulness is when it comes to his drinking a Brett Kavanaugh\nOn a number of occasions was pressed on his drinking and high school and college and it was either a ... in his answers a sort of downplayed it at times or pushed back on a couple of senators at times asking them how much they drag on and and so President Trump was asked about that today in in the White House press briefing and President Trump\nA sort of incorrectly said well Brett Kavanaugh on his testimony said that he had a drinking problem and he was younger\nUm which is not what Kavanaugh had said um but uh [noise]\n... did he was like in the amount of time that came up yes because it came up frequently the White House ah realizes that this is an issue or they are pushing back\nThey're insisting that cabin not basically admitted to everything except blacking out uh and and they're also now pushing out statements from a witnesses from college who say no no no I was his roommate and that other roommate who said something else is wrong\nAmy who does this help in the mid term if if Brett Kavanaugh the gets on the Supreme Court Mitch McConnell has a real it's going to happen this week it doesn't help Republicans in the mid term I\nDon't know I mean if\nIt's the conventional wisdom right that they are so fired up about this not simply because the important so they put on the Supreme Court but because they had to unify together to fight off what they see as a smear campaign by Democrats\nBut then we hear from Democrats and even some Republicans who say but\nWhile it may help Republicans in some of these red states especially in Senate seats and it's really going to hurt Republican candidates in the swing suburban areas where women are already breaking decidedly against Republicans against the president including independent women those are really the key voters here\nThat strategist started looking to at this point to determine where the house goes and I don't think that they're they're going to turn to the side of Republicans on this issue\nAnother factor maybe in the house goes in the money and we saw Political Report today they did an analysis that they said that Democrats have raised something like thirty five million dollars just in August a loan for their democratic candidate\nKim what does this mean does this is I mean more votes for Democrats doesn't mean that they want to put more money what does it mean\nAnd it doesn't mean that there are a lot of Democrats what checkbooks who are very interested in a lot of races all over the country and they're all democratic candidates had these incredibly viral ads that they've put out that has gone viral on social media have generated support I mean you hear people I you know because I cover politics I people ask me like what\nDo you think of this race in Kentucky quite what's going on here um there there there is\nA huge amount of interest and there is a huge amount of enthusiasm you see that in the money you see that in the number of people who showed up for about two O'Rourke rally in Texas\nAre you you see the energy and enthusiasm and a lot of places now Republicans would say that they also have a lot of energy and they do to just not as much as the Democrats at ... at this time\nYeah I mean I'm Talking to a consultant on both sides many of them have been doing this for a long time\nAnd they've never seen a this amount of money more important they've never seen an incumbent an incumbent party get outspent the way Democrats are outspending Republicans in these congressional races I mean it's it's um it's mind boggling number\nAnd this is why when we talk about why the house and play the houses in play because\nThe amount of enthusiasm that Democrats have is translating and all these different ways\nIt ... it turned into one enthusiasm for democratic voters candidates who said I'm going to run for office including a bunch of people who'd never run for office before and now the money what it's done is it's taken a playing field\nThat was really narrow and it was structurally very challenging for Democrats because we're only twenty five thirty seats in play and it expanded that universe to now we have a universe right now about sixty Republican seats that are in danger that\nIs why I Know that's one of those yeah this is not\nSpreadsheet can not handle any more racially are okay [laughter] someone that you know I'm All right let me ask about for us political long because I think would be a fun question I feel like the universe has been dominated by just a handful of stories but let me asking what political stories are not talking about that we should be Towne\nWon a temporary budget passed a spending measure and\nThere wasn't a massive fight nothing crazy happened it just passed the president signed it no drama no drama which is wild made and there was no drama also this is a small thing but there's only been one there was in the month of September there was only one televised White House press briefing daily White House press briefing only happened on one day and the entire amount of September\nBriefly Amy I'm I Do think this money is is absolutely going to be the story of the twentieth and campaign the question for Democrats is can they replicate this when it's no longer just simply about ousting Donald Trump or his party in the mid term election\nAnd when they might have one candidate that when you're twenty thank you very much Amy Walter the cook Political Report camera case of NPR thank you both welcome\n[noise]\n\nFinally tonight Jeffrey Brown has the latest installment in our monthly
