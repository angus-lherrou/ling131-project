climate change\nIs warmer water provides more energy and moisture feeds the storm President Trump ...\nEverybody's got rave reviews I just folks with Governor Scott they're very happy as food is being now following hurricane being brought in a way of unbelievable large amounts of water\nAnd everything that people didn't want\nThis morning vice president Mike Pence said that the government was actively engaged\nPresident and I have a have been focused on a our response efforts we've taken decisive action in in as we speak we're focused on the lifesaving mission search and rescue and beginning to assess the catastrophic impacts with this for\nThe storm made his way up the south east coast and dumped more rain on already saturated North Carolina\nGovernor Roy Cooper said the state was on high alert for more flooding\nThe rain over six inches nail in parts of western North Carolina North Carolina was spared the vicious speeding Michael brought to Florida in parts of Georgia\nThis storm will not go down without a fight it is still a threat in should be taken seriously particularly was storm surge high winds flooding and the threat of tornadoes\nFor the PBS NewsHour in the panhandle of Florida and William Wrangham\nI spoke with way in the short time ago from Quincy, Florida where am I understand here about Seventy miles from the coast where the storm came ashore tell us what it is like where you are\nWhen you're in a stretch that we've seen so far it is a story of tree after Trey after Trey after\nTreating knocked over by hurricane Michael I mean this stretch of the Florida Panhandle is known for its lush canopy\nAnd now the high winds of that storm of turned all those trees into into this community has nightmare power lines have been knocked down as part of why there's over a million people who have no power those high winds that came in late last night also have knocked out all the cell phone towers around here so\nCommunication is very difficult we heard on the radio today one local public officials with using the radio a radio interview to try to communicate with one of their own emergency managers somewhere that they couldn't find them simply because they couldn't pick up a phone there would actually work\nSo restoring power has been a huge issue here you might hear from behind me that's really the armada of utility trucks that are coming through this entire area trying to restore power but from what we saw the amount of power lines we saw down on the ground it's going to be a long time for these communities to get their power back\nSeeing those images from the coast in Mexico beach in Panama City the destruction seems so severe\nInjuries of devastation along the coastline is just there really are no words to describe how bad that damage years\nAnd I think that's simply a function of if you have a category ... storm it was very nearly a category five coming in a hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds there's only so much you can do I mean if you remember Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in Nineteen Ninety two and building codes across the state were strengthened\nBut in the face of a category for with already high tides and that wall of water and that amount of wind\nThere's only so much you can re engineer against that kind of a force and so that's really going to be one of the ongoing challenges here is how do they rebuild knowing that this storm this kind of a storm could come again next week next month next year\nAnd I understand some medical facilities were damaged and officials have had to evacuate patient\nThat's right Judy it's our understanding that at least two hospitals in in Panama City Florida right along the coast had to evacuate their patients they've lost power they have no fresh water coming in there we believe it's around three hundred patients that they've had to be evacuated a bay in medical apparently was one of the bigger hospitals there\nThey had an intense damage to their intensive care unit there were windows knocked out apparently there's some flooding inside the building and so if a hospital can't keep the power on regularly can't get fresh water to run the toilet and simply have drinking water it's simply safer so they are moving patients\nOut of there it's a nearby hospital to the east in the west that might have some power so we'll be watching closely\nWilliam thank you thanks very\nNow we explore the storms damaged further with Florida's US Senator Bill Nelson he joins us from Panama City beach senator thank you for talking with us I Know insane hurricanes before how does this one compare\nJob and they say we'll give you more money for having more to see\nHer home there was something about when I put his hat off\nIt made me feel like Superman you made a Superman that was that's my favorite superhero\nAnd you made a supermax tapes for me we're going to power our factory we can bring not only a fetus on shore we could bring Scott set up a factory and not to Minnesota fifty three\nAnd was often they are four thousand jobs people making fifty three thousand dollars a year but we make everything uh China and not America there were cheating on our country and we're putting people in positions that have\nTo do a legal thing ends up in a cheapest factory ever the prison system\nWas that was what was\nThat was one of those shows will who sold\nFor more on this our White House correspondent Michele send our joins me now so you mean as you were telling me after Kanye West comments there was a strong reaction most of it negative what's behind that was\nReally a truly bizarre moment at the White House and that's mainly because this was ... that showed that really extreme change and it's kind of you with us politics\nWith all the rapper known for his social activism he was caught he was the rapper also known for calling out President Trump he famously said that ... that President Bush didn't care about black people calling on President George W. Bush and that and since he was talking about the train and the fact that they were African American\nWho didn't feel as though they were the government cared about them after the response to hurricane instead now you have ... saying that he not only an outspoken supporter of President Trump which of course would be in some ways normal it's the fact that he said stuff like slavery is a choice\nAnd he's also today and in in in what being almost ten minute monologue he talked about really stereotype that have been used to get the African American\nThroughout history he said that at some point African Americans like welfare and the fact that they're not fathers in the homes of African American and these are things that are again stereotypes are not true\nSo a lot of people were looking at tiny weapon saying who is this person the record that we know with someone who was uplifting African American community so now people are really really questioning kind of where we go from here when you mentioned this was a meeting the jets\nSponsorship of ... D life's dream bike at the gym presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November force at the gym or freedom theater at the gym and stuff dot com\nActually in West both taken up the issue of criminal justice reform his wife came crashing actually directly appeal to the president and got a prisoner released\nThrough that appeal so he was talking about Larry Hoover today and he was saying that he's he was talking about the fact that Larry Hoover who is in a really a founder or co founder of the gangsters disciple but to the street gang in Chicago should be released into someone facing more than a hundred years in prison because of murder so it kinda was basically supposed to be talking about that but then went off on\nA tirade about his mental health issues and all sorts of other things\nSpeculation image the president was welcome in this in part because it's an outrage to African American voters to support him what effect do we think this could have a on the president's support\nWe don't have any polling yet of course but eventually this is likely not going to help President Trump or calling us really appeal to African American Democrats or African American Republicans on the one hand African American Republicans want to have an audience with the president\nThey want to be talking about the economy about wages maybe about small business loans or after the African American communities across the country but they're not getting the audience they kind of us in getting so that the angry black Republicans and then on the black\nFor black Democrats they see somebody who's really lashing out and using stereotypes and that also isn't going to appeal the African American voters so on both instance and this was really just I think a weird moment of the Trump presidency and it was really about to celebrity reality TV stars chatting it up for ten minutes but not really much substance came out of the discussion\nWell it was certainly one that got everybody's attention today at an unusual if at least ... thank you thanks [noise] and uh\nStill to come on the news hour the state of us election security adult coming midterm\nSaudi Arabia comes under increased scrutiny in the disappearance of a dissident writer potential solutions to the uncertain future recycling in the United states and voiceless spectacular tape on writing about other people's lives [noise]\nWith a twenty Eighteen mid term elections less than a month away and early voting already underway in some state officials and the Trump Administration are sounding the alarm about foreign attempts to influence the outcome of next month vote I\nSpoke a short time ago with Christopher crabs he's under secretary\nOf the department of homeland security national protection and programs directorate about these concerns and I started by asking him how he sees the threat\nGiven our experiences to thousands sixteen and what we saw the Russians attempt to do across the nation to election equipment election infrastructure we certainly have a degree of concern of what their capability and they're typically is in a prior intent is demonstrated\nSo that's kind of in the planning factor that we've been working against the fact whether they come back or not we have an aging the building the Russian right for sure right uh we haven't seen a demonstrated Russian activity\nIn a repeat of two thousand sixteen but I mentioned the planning aspect how we're planning we're ready we're playing for them to come back and I think in terms of where we are for sixteen\nUh mentioned this before but I think this is probably going to be the most secure election in the modern era because of the amount of work we've done with state and local election officials who are by the constitution by law responsible for ministry elections federal elections\nWill as you know the president the vice president have gone out of their way in the last few days to talk about China to say that China's been trying to meddle in our elections vice president went so far as to say what the Russians have done pales in comparison to what the Chinese are doing can you explain what that means spell it out\nYeah I think we need to keep in mind that given the way they were connected and given the way we consume and Jews and share information there's a broad range of opportunities for any nation state whether it's Russia or China\nTo try to influence the way Americans think and they act and so the Russians I think it's been historically or at least most recently much noisier much more out in front they've attempted to get into election equipment and manipulate their they've also use social media to sow discord and divisiveness\nThe Chinese are much more strategic much more uh under the radar perhaps a with a longer more strategic game and play in their attempts ear or to influence the way the Americans think about policy issues\nAnd down the road whether it's the Eighteen but but also more for the midterm on sort of the the twenty twenty presidential trying to influence how voters when they go to the polls you know what what bubble they're going to fill in what button they're going to push\nWell it's interesting as you mentioned that because uh uh we've seen a I guess newspaper inserts a one in particular in Iowa the president tweeted about that but we saw that the editor of the Des Moines register the newspaper where this\nInsert was she was quoted as saying I'm this kind of in certain meats are standard criteria for for advertising unlike the kind of hidden thing is you just mentioned the Russians\nWere doing um so is it really that underhanded I guess my question\nIt's not that it's under handed it said it's in fact the foreign influence operations so we think back to two thousand six teams are and what the Russians attempted to do they use their state sponsored media outlets of Sputnik an art tea\nTo amplify messaging dry false narratives China's doing the same thing with China Daily and other instruments which state media and\nYou know they're carrying a message on behalf of Beijing in this case so while it may\nA message on behalf of Beijing in this case so while it may meet some journalistic standard they're still trying to accomplish an outcome and achieve their own policy objectives through these through these efforts\nAs it is that when we think the Russians as just spreading disinformation the Chinese are basically getting their point of view is there a difference there\nWell I absolutely and I I think a again when you kind of lay it all out on the table of what the independent or are they the various objectives of the nation may be that the Russians are much more tactical and operational in here and today\nAh you know for them a strong us doesn't really benefit them in the long run the Chinese however we have a a ... a relationship and it is important that they well they think strategically and so for them they want our outcomes our policy objectives to align with their with their longer term uh goals so how are we encounter\nIn in in uh in your job you know worrying about security in the elections\nSo I think about things in two different ways one is defending today and that's working with state and local election officials to ensure that for the midterm twenty Eighteen elections\nDoes have as much information to secure their own systems that they have the technical support and resources that they need\nTo defend their systems and protect the vote but also we're securing the future and what I mean by that is there still equipment that is old that needs to be replaced and so when they go through for current process do they have the right information to make secure decisions for tomorrow's deployments\nI Want to I Want to quote something that director of national intelligence sad that are in June ... said in twenty Eighteen it's twenty Eighteen and we continue to see Russian targeting of American society in ways that could affect\nSponsorship of ... the live stream by as a Gen

something like a hundred thousand tons of food waste a day but barely five percent that that is being recycled use it all and we'd be able to power more than a million homes a day and that's not
