and I thought that train for going by and I realized it was our house member I can also foundation and less floating around as war backfire vehicle [noise]\nHere in Panama City which is about twenty miles from Mexico beach a lot of residents here also chose not to evacuate earlier this week the governor and issued a mandatory evacuation order for this region when you have to remember that back then Michael was only a category one storm\nTore Clifton trench was in his house when Michael ... at his grandmother and ten year old sister evacuated but he and his dad's Dave\nBarricaded my father

flash flooding across North Carolina and Virginia overnight before heading out in the Atlantic ocean today\nToday our state begins recovering from yet another storm\nNorth Carolina governor Roy Cooper said rescue crews working around the clock this coming just months after Hurricane Florence struck the eastern part of his day during Michael\nWe saw rain totaling\nAlmost ten inches\nIn Allegheny

together they're glad to be safe in to a person everyone told us that this is the last hurricane they'll try to ride out\nAnd William joins me now so William you are now in Panama City that's close to where the hurricane came ashore tell us what you're saying there\nYou're near the scale of destruction here is just incredibly vast out on the coast which is about a mile in that direction we saw what the storm surge did to those communities\nThat wall of water just ripped buildings right off their foundations further inland which is where we are right now the destruction is much more bass it's a much bigger area and it's largely the wind that brought down these trees everywhere we go we see trees that have come down they pull power lines down the damage people's houses\nI mean the street behind me right now is probably the clearest road we have seen all day long\nYou can probably hear chainsaw behind me every one is working to try to clean their house as best they can put a harp on the roof of the rains come again but basically it's that nobody has water nobody has power the grocery stores are closed the gas stations are closed so how long\nResidents here can keep living like this is not clear about may have months and months before anything get back to normal here\nAnd what about the relief effort are there enough rescue and recovery people out there in the area\nDays and days and days that something new to and it's because we're beginning to see the disruption of wind currents along with ocean currents and so\nThe the northern hemisphere jetstream or that that normally moves the storms are out to the east is getting loop here and wave here and sometimes disorganized so uh this is really serious stuff we have a global emergency and you you use the phrase like that and some people\nAre immediately say OK calm down you know that can't be that bad but it is what the scientists\nHave warned us in this recent report is that if we do not take action quickly\nTo switch away from a dirty fossil fuels and shift to electric vehicles and make agriculture in forestry much more sustainable and deal with the waste loops in manufacturing all things that we can do we know how to do them we ought to be doing these things for other reasons anyway\nBut if we do not began taking action very quickly\nAnd creating jobs in the process by the way then the scientists warn us that the consequences down the road would be far far worse than what we're experiencing now and could actually extend to an existential threat\nTo human civilization on this planet as we know it\nWell let me I didn't want to ask about the political response as you know a number of conservatives other scientists are saying hey this dire a future for actions are just not borne out by evidence but the thing is the political ah\nWell hold it hold on let me stop you there when you say other scientists not really a there there are a few\nThere a few outliers but you know Ninety nine plus percent of the scientific community is aligned on the subject if you still have some people who say the earth is flat and not around but you don't give them equal time and he's saying some people say round some people say flat and they lied or to interrupt\nYou know they are a minority but they are\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream bike has said Jim presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or freedom theater ... death dot com\nThreat to the future of our civilization yes\nWell hey when it comes to political reaction to the president President Trump and people in his administration don't seem to be taking this new un report very seriously the president said something like I can give you a report that are fabulous I can give me some that aren't that good he and the people around hammer tank\nWhere mostly focused on the economy are and what we're doing is rolling back regulations environmental regulations that hurt our economy and slow down business in this country\nAs well or his proposal is literally insane and his reaction\nTo the scientific community's warnings or ... is a a an outlier reaction uh it's making a the U.S come off like a rogue message and and\nBeing different from any other nation in the entire world and of course everybody knows it's because of the large carbon polluters or ... or a A R his buddies and he wants to use them as a\nAs a way of signaling or to ultra conservatives that he doesn't care about what the truth of the matter is\nPresident Trump is out right now on the campaign trail almost every day trying to stir up his base voters I sang that Democrats are like an angry mob coming off the Kavanaugh\nNomination to the Supreme Court is currently trying to stir up his base but my question to here is is that an effective tactic on his part\nWell we'll find out this November ah I I don't know Judy I'm not a great political analyst but my personal impression is\nThat there are tens of millions of Americans some of whom are wanted to take a chance on Trump the last time around changing things up trying something new but I think there are tens of millions of who\nGave him a chance and are now a little bit hard sick that he has been acting out to every day a telling fall so it's almost as easily as the breeze and\nI Know some people will hear me say that it's like oh that's just a democratic reaction I I get to that we have a more tribalism to use the buzz word that's common these days\nThan it is healthy for our nation but common sense and a a respect for\nFor a reason discourse has always played a balancing role in American politics I have a feeling that it's going to play a role in this election I think that if ever there was a time\nFor the re institution of the checks and balances that our founders put into our constitution now is that time and I think a lot of Republicans and independents as well as Democrats are kind of quietly\nItching for the opportunity to go to the polls and send a message to President Trump to calm down don't be so crazy don't be so harmful to our country\nWhat should the Democratic party's message be they share and then going into twenty twenty where the president who has made his own personality such a big issue\nWell he's a he's a talented entertainer ... reality t._v. uh a star a but he ... his uh tournaments president is not really\nGoing well in in my opinion are the economic recovery which began under the last administration has continued unabated I'm even with the stock market a roller coaster or this week\nUh I expected hope it will continue but the damage he is doing to the good name of the United states of America is Justin calculus Mullen I I think people law do not want this kind of\nOf anger and repeated false hundreds or in our political discourse and you asked me what the Democrats should do well I guess the tide strategy would just be to say look\nOr give us a chance to kind of rain him in a little bit and uh prevent so many of these excesses so that he doesn't have free rein to\nTo put the polluters in charge of environmental policy to take away protections the American people need and all these other areas of our lives and I I kinda think the American people are going to want to do that in November\nFormer vice president Al Gore joining us from Los Angeles thank you very much thank you [noise]\n\nAs we've

released from its most serious point of contention [noise]\nBronx and left the courthouse in a convoy after being convicted on terrorism charges and it was set free on time served\nYou spent two years in custody and recently became a media sensation as he went between court in house arrest the charges against him locked all other progress on us Turkish relations and became the main irritant between Turkish president regimented aired on in the U.S\nReleased pastor Andrew Brunson now or be prepared to face\nThe consequences from July to yesterday vice president Mike Pence and the administration maintain pressure on turkey was sanctions and public statements we will continue to stand strong\nA until ... Bronson there's for today President Trump tweeted in all caps pastor Brunson just released will be home soon on freezing the turkey us relationship says Washington Institute for Near East policy senior fellow sooner chapter\nUs Turkish relations hit an all time low when President Trump slapped sanctions against turkey or because turkey kept detaining us past the Bronx and in jail there and are undecided that it was time for him to turn to relationship around a primarily because he needs a U.S assistance also to push back another front against Saudi Arabia\nTurkey accusing Saudi Arabia of murdering Jamal her show the inside is stumble conflict Turkish officials released CCTV images of what they call a Saudi hit squad that killed his show and Turkish officials have anonymously claimed to have video and audio proving murder\nOr that side so we have two different elections in their seats are pretty strong momentum in opposite directions\nHoward Democrats countering that sending this approached by the president marketing there there is this a couple of polls including the one we did with Maris NPR this week it came out show yes the enthusiasm gap\nAh has narrowed it was that Democrats were more energized and indeed Republicans seem to be more energized what ... how did Democrats come back\nWell the first thing that I Do is is is stopped picketing and stop but boycotting uh and organize I made the most democratic group in the entire electorate emotions age Eighteen and thirty five\nAnd they live everywhere they aren't concentrated in certain districts like a practice African Americans Latinos are\nAh they're they're everywhere and that if they vote the Democrats win big I will say this I think the most encouraging signs of the Democrats the Democrats do have a at a national back row message in this campaign it's about\nChecks and balances on President it's not a new message but it's it's a message that certainly resonates it off a lot of voters are about preserving the strength of health care of it particularly the uh the the a preexisting condition a provision but most of all I think it's contrasted Republicans who don't have\nA national message they really don't they're running Mike Rowe campaigns\nOne can't one district hits you double park and you've got several parking tickets\nYou were late on your library books or you missed your mother's birthday I mean they're running very personal campaigns in the very micro sense I think that's good so I don't think I'd say is look at the governor's races the governor's races across the country if you really want to see which way the country's going\nThey're going blue they're not they're not going red when you've got Democrats couldn't competitive in places like Oklahoma and Kansas I'm In South Dakota which they are right that as we speak here tonight\nUh then you know there's a possibility that the Democrats sweeping that entire belt from the Midwest all the way to the east coast\nWe did hear David Al Gore sank talking about checks and balances I say that's a good motivating thing for Democrats um but but what about that I mean is and I are we seeing Democrats are United in some way and sound and the message that there is\nNo unity is not any parties problem right now they're both they're all pretty unified uh to me or one of the ... an interesting debate is happening and you could call it the Michelle Obama Hillary Clinton debate [noise]\nUh and when Michele Obama famously said when they go low will go high she's sticking to that I have another Clinton says no they're going lo we got to go to and you see that debate I think in this age or\nHaving the moral high ground is a bit of an advantage a major advantage and because of Donald Trump's behavior or he has put the Republicans at a moral disadvantage\nAnd keeping go staying Hi sting regionally civil not totally going into the the gutter with Donald Trump strikes me is the right democratic strategy in the right strategy for any movement\nBecause once you go down there you self corrupt and so I Won big in Sierra colder said if they go after us we kick them you know that you're beginning to see a lot of people getting so angry about having on other things or any means necessary\nTo me that that is a mistake just for the soul of your party\nThey let me say I agree with David I think it's a it's not only the right thing to do um but uh the wise thing to do it because of the best interest of the country\nAnd as a practical level you can't compete with Donald Trump is just better at it than anybody else that are asked he lives that are better at finding identifying the weakness a shortcoming of his opponent and then explaining it\nUm it didn't it it is a is a major talent to do the Syrian leader each of this Republican challenges in twenty sixteen he did it to ... to Secretary Clinton and the election um and and that's really what what makes this mid term election he he he's searching for an opponent is that he can do the same\nAnd the politics he specializes in is I don't really like those kinds of people\nLike we used to have to wait for the health care about you know the economic policy about foreign policy now it's just those people are really bad those people who say your bed actually they're the bad ones and and that's the style of politics somehow we've gotten away from issues and the governor's races or maybe that's a third electric cars with governors races tend to be a little more about issues and they are suffering to them\nAnd and one one governor's race I don't know if it's swinging to the Democrat but it is in Georgia\nI'm Mark where you have a Stacey Abrams African American woman running for governor she is now working pointing out her Republican opponent has the state attorney general\nSector I I'm Sorry and check their shake a it pointing out that he is by virtue of an action he's taken in the last few weeks\nSuppressing the votes she says uh fifty three thousand\nPotential voters what I think most of the more than two thirds of them happened to the African American and she's trying to make an issue of this and he should step down as a state as a secretary\nOf state is that something that you know in a place like Georgia is likely to be a factor\nA ... certainly Stacey Abrams campaign is is interested in registering and turning out African American voted the idea of any minority group especially when there's been marginalized minority group electing one of its own to the governorship\nIs is a motivating factor to vote on the fact that Brian Kemp\nBy virtue of an action he's taken him in the last few weeks suppressing the votes she says uh fifty three thousand of potential voters what I think most of the more than two thirds of them happened to the African American and she's trying to make an issue of this ending he should step down as a state as a secretary\nOf state is that something that you know in a place like Georgia is likely to be effective\nUh ... certainly Stacey Abrams campaign is is interested in registering a turning out African American voted the idea of any minority group especially when there's been a marginalized minority group electing one of its own to the governorship\nIs is a motivating factor to vote\nOn the fact that Brian Kemp secretary of state has not recused themselves and that is this is the same so overtly engaged in a in a suppression Seventy percent of the fifty three thousand people who now as I as as his registration has closed had been told that they couldn't vote\n'em and does it does seem a up beyond ... bad play a bad form it really seems like just a bad ethics\nAnd secretary of state David he oversees elections settled you start running for governor\nI don't know how clear the suppression you see the Republicans are claiming that if you come to the polls that id you'll be able to load yeah so it's unclear to me how severe it but it is but it's a no brainer that if you're running for an election you shouldn't be super ... election like\nYou're the you're the hitter and the umpire and that doesn't work or and so he should have recused himself long ago and it and to me it's it's just a no brainer that's obviously what you do in any normal circumstance\nFew minutes we have left I Want to ask you about the way what's been going on this week with Saudi Arabia and us mark\nThe Saudi journalist who disappeared is believed to have been murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey and assemble turkey the the Trump President Trump and people around him seem to be holding back in their criticism of Saudi Arabia that President said it it's not good it doesn't look good\nBut where where what should and administrative and that has had a I tried to be close to Saudi Arabia based saying right now about what appears to be this unspeakable thing that happened\nWell I mean at the American administration would be expected to have a moral bearing a Republican or Democrat\nUm and the moral foundation of the incident minister ration this president has never made any pretense to it I mean he lives by the golden rule that is he has the gold rules um and he's he's he's quite open about it\nI mean he he is reduced is I mean the charge is so serious that are recruited by the Soviets by the Saudis themselves by the powers to be a Fifteen people went in and took her show\nAnd then dismembered him I went in with the saw that got cut off loans I mean it it is that that that beyond human decency and imagine so it don't imaginable so I mean to me that that is that's what's missing here is any sense of morality most of all just thirty second sorry\nYeah I mean usually when you sold your soul for money you try to hide the fact whether it's our official policy now\nThat if you are rich and you buy a lot of stuff for most of them you can also join monstrous things and it is a commercials mentality a that is not what we should for all their lives and not what we would expect in any human being a state of dust and you said we have different loves and some are higher than others and I love for basically since we should be higher than our love or money\nOn that now has Brooks shells thank you thank you\n[noise]\nFinally I think we'd all agree it's a turbulent time in American Life
