strong challenges in some key places across the country to talk about a few of these I'm joined by Bill Nye God of Georgia Public broadcasting in Atlanta\nFrederica fiber of Wisconsin Public television in Madison and Tom Hudson of W ELL are in public radio in Miami hello to all three of you are so glad to have you with us I'm going to start with the biggest population state\nTom Hudson of course that's Florida and use the Republican incumbent Republican governor Rick Scott is giving that up to run\nFor the U.S Senate and it's turned into a pre tight race between the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee a and Republican congressmen Rhonda sat us tell us what each one of these men has going in their favor on what's working against them\nThis is not a boulevard election in Florida there is no middle of the road this is as polarized you know the state election that you're going to find here in this election cycle Judy I think that what you have is on one side and excited progressive\nDemocrats are in the face of Andrew Gillum who excited base\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream thanks Cindy from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home life by for ultimately has been the home\nOf Tallahassee a and Republican congressmen Rhonda than us tell us what each one of these men has going in their favor on what's working against them\nWell this is not a boulevard election in Florida there is no middle of the road this is as polarized you know the state election that you're going to find here in this election cycle Judy\nI think that what you have is on one side and excited progressive a Democrat or in the face of Andrew Gillum who excited base voters to come out in the primary and surprised a lot of pollsters\nAnd a lot of professional political watchers\nTo win in a very crowded Democratic primary and on the other hand you have a a non traditional Republican candidate in the form of congressman Rhonda Santas\nWho has run on the playbook of twenty sixteen Donald Trump and very successfully\nWho beat back a much more traditional Republican candidate\nIn the primary so for voters thirty percent of Florida voters that are non party affiliated they did not participate in the August primary you have to be registered in one party or the other to vote right these are this is where the battleground is this is why I say this is not a boulevard type of election there is no middle ground there\nFighting tooth and nail for each and every one of those votes and they count or the last two Florida gubernatorial elections\nHave been decided by fewer than Seventy thousand votes\nOkay well in terms of what they have going for and against them the issues I'm going to come back to you on that but I Do want to get quickly to Georgia and tipped bill now I got a bill this governor seat the Republicans have held it\nFor decades now have a fiery Democrat and Stacey Abrams who happens to be an African American a woman running against the secretary of state Brian Kemp she's giving him a run for their money what are the main factor is at this point in this race\nIssues have very very tight race according to virtually every poll it's a race of contrast a strong Democrat yes just strong conservative Republican\nAbrams has been focusing like a laser on a couple of really key issues she wants to expand Medicaid in Georgia and she's focusing on education on public education so she's been very very focused on issues\nShe's also been a attacking Brian Kemp over issues of voter suppression um we've gotten a lot of national attention as you well know Judy or because there are people who think that the secretary of state Brian Kemp now running for governor\nHas over the years excluded people from the voter rolls African Americans who are being denied the right\nTo vote that's somewhat unknown issue here we're not quite sure how methodical and deliberative it's been but certainly the optics suggests that have been some problems there Brian Kemp spin on the attack\nA they debated here last night and Brian Kemp spent a great deal of his time are repeating a theme that he's used throughout the race which is Stacey Abrams is a radical she's too liberal for\nGeorge or she's getting money from national democratic forces outside the state and he's focused on that as a big part of the race\nLet's turn to Wisconsin Frederica fried bird\nThe Republican incumbent Governor Scott Walker has really this is his fourth run if you count the recall election he won in twenty ten and he's run into surprisingly strong opposition from Tony in verse tell us about this race what are the factors working on both in both sides\nWhile it's true ah Scott Walker and Tony neighbors are in what is protecting at the end very tight race I mean one or two points race according to experts so Tony ... is the superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin and he uh is kind of sticking this claim to being the education governor\nA but Scott Walker is now saying that he is the education governor because he infused out his state budget\nWith a new money or for K. twelve schools and so this is something that these candidates have been fighting back and forth over a including a a really a difficult achievement gap racial achievement gap in in the states urban\nSchool districts are which are among the worst in the nation and and each of them are blaming each other over the past I'll bet yeah Scott Walker find himself in in a tighter race\nAnd then he might have thought he would have had\n... and Tom Hudson back to you on on Florida just quickly what matters most to voters they share how and how much of a factor as President Trump\nPresident Trump has been an enormous factor here in the Florida gubernatorial election I think on the issue side is health care uh there's debate around a pre existing conditions and a congressman to San Francisco position federally on the Affordable CARE Act as it comes to pre existing conditions and of course on the Democratic side Andrew Gillum\nPledging support to expand Medicaid which also has not been expanded here in the state of Florida under the Affordable CARE Act also the environment which traditionally has never been a real\nA driving motivating issue here but this is another last summer that we've had in Florida we've had blue green algae in Lake Okeechobee the big blue lake in the center of the of the state and then we've also had a naturally occurring red tide a more\nA stronger outbreak of red tide and the Gulf Coast and also on the Atlantic side so it has put water quality front and center\nOr in this gubernatorial campaign for both parties that we haven't seen in elections pass\nThey'll now I got what about issues that factors in the race or in in Georgia and and ... and in particular President Trump\nHas not been much of a factor in the general election campaign or he's tweeted a couple of times now his support for Brian Kemp print to come to us and talk about him a lot on the campaign trail and Stacey Abrams has not been spending a great deal of deal of hurts\nPaying trail and Stacey Abrams has not been spending a great deal of deal of her time attacking him and I think the simple reason for that is\nUm Trump won Georgia by five or so points but I think both sides recognize that Trump as we've seen in other races can be as much of a distraction as he is an advantage he might motivate Democrats as much as Republicans\nFrederica fiber got President Trump is in Wisconsin today\nAnd try to in fact he is arriving in that that kind of north central part of the state later this afternoon this is a part of the states that Trump won by double digits a and so his visit is expected of course they're kind of energize and and Bush the Republican base and and that's what Republicans and Governor Walker\nAre hoping happens however\nI'm as your last guest suggested\nA Democrats are thinking that it also has a parent's hair also boost their base\nSo already a large lines are forming a for President Trump again is appearing in one of these kinds of things that he won by double digits there were twenty three counties or in the state of Wisconsin I'm twenty six team that had previously voted for a Brock Obama then turned and voted for Donald Trump\nOr a rural part of Wisconsin and finally back you Tom Hudson on day ... the I guess you'd call them the X factors in this race charges of corruption and then that frankly some racism\nI absolutely racist playing a an enormous role also in this uh as far as the a corruption investigation is as an FBI investigation\nAnd we have doctors every day is you just said with your friends still prescribing thirty days worth of oxycontin or Viking into Percocet for a sprained ankle or sprained wrist\nAnd this is not the dishonest doctors unscrupulous this is good ... these are good doctors we haven't changed with the current science and we're we you know\nSponsorship of the cake you eat the live stream thanks sanity from Comcast extended Internet delivers in home why for all devices and the home\nAs this country we would contain it in a weekend\nGary Humphrey as the legislation has been signed there's maybe a sense of closure to all of this but I'd like to put you back in the position of counseling the house in the Senate and the president from today forward what would you like to see us do\nI Would like us to stop thinking oh this is a crisis meaning a short term issue that will be resolved by a couple of years of hard work\nAnd instead just be realistic that addiction is part of the fabric of population health it has been a you know they're tired history of our country and it's not going to go away and two or three years we would never have a grant program to take care of cancer for two or three years because we know we're we're always going to people with cancer\nSo we need to do is bite the bullet going to programs like Medicaid and Medicare adequately reimburse a treatment\nMake a big investment in training 'cause we need a physicians and nurses and psychologist and other professionals who are\nAre trained in this uh taking care of this disorder and just accept this will be part of what the healthcare system does from here on out because right now it's opioids you know ten years from now it's going to be a different drug and we have to be prepared for that All right Keith I'm pretty scary Mondale thank you both very much my pleasure thank you thanks case [noise]\n\n\nThey dedicate their lives just saving others but they can't

medical board show out of twenty two applicants who reported mental diagnoses in the past three years none ended up with any impact to their license whack\n[noise]\nThat may be a question for the board in our department to\nReview it's a similar story in other states that require disclosure the head of Wyoming's medical board said in my eleven years with the board I cannot recall a single time that the board declined to license a physician or physician assistant on the basis of a disclosed mental health condition\nThere's why widespread concern that many of these questions with not a whole
