again the big technology companies which really are raping to expand into every ... of our lives\nWe spoke with for a year ago his book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nSince become relevant just because they fired a respect for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation founded the writing of it\nIt it actually does it feel good because New America has been supportive of me overtime and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and just about them when they've been so nice to me but this does feel like we reflective of a much bigger issue\nWho was the critic who was fired\nHis name is Barry Lynn and he ran from make all the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly in a very vociferous critic of a group of\nWhat used to have an affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of the America\nThis week on freakonomics radio we tell the rest about Messi story at\nNo point did Google for any ... tell me to fire Barry land\nAnd we look at how corporations use philanthropy to shape the public debate and how that can go terribly wrong\n[noise]\nGuess freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nBarry Lynn started out as journalists I worked in Venezuela and improve as a foreign correspondent and then after that I rent a magazine called global business magazine we should say it was a pro business magazine [noise] we were a magazine that came to the people who ran businesses\nSo we had a real inside look at\nHow global education actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to Lynn crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got the work going and we did it uh with\nIncreasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty six pain we had a number of folks on the hills to earn to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out to say\nI Wanna actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized\nAt Phil Hill Senator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem\nTo gay in America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problem since a series of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms out lots of companies depend on for survival by ... apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with as small companies said that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is it's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power that leaves two concentrations of well an concentrations of wealth lead to\nConcentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market Institute but also its parent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies unrest of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who's now president and CEO of New America\nWhat convinced me to leave Princeton then come out of New America which was a big move 'cause I had a a wonderful position at at Princeton\nOr was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debates about our future and the digital age\nBut and Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America were not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing some of our attention on the platform monopolies and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the the questions was um\nWas ... or work a new American problematic for Google Google ... of Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the board to Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years\nHe stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn for years Smith was also CEO of Google\nHe's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself between Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this was a relationship that goes back to the very early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination\nEuropean antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website ... congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we released this statement in support of the decision in Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty knife I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times they're headline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision to reconsider and if it could not be reconsidered I asked for more time and I was told that neither of those was possible\nThe writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn's open markets Institute told us simpler version of events he made it clear that lens statement about the European regulators decision\nAnd this was something that was a bit too far for Google and New America was very generous than supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly outraged by their treatment\nOf very and I can't resign from New America because I'm not affiliated with them and not taking any money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nBy Anne Marie slaughter offered a substantially different portrayal first of all she says no\nThunder at New America has ever influenced New America content in any way\nAnd uh I'd like to see possibly experimentation with a former foundation peer review and which you know an effort analogous to what happens in academia happens within the foundation world\nIt would be surprising if the philanthropic efforts of corporations were purely altruistic corporation seek to advance their own interest especially in their lobbying quite possibly often in their philanthropy\nI'm trying to stimulate people to be morally awake and in the same moment to get people to consider what type of public policies are frameworks ought to governance structure our collective lives which is a moral

athletes were look the chess experts surgeons doctors teachers musicians\nTaxi drivers recreational activities like golf\nAnd even there is some research on on scientists\nDefined choking for me as you see it\n[noise] or choking to me is is actually somebody who cramps up an an and in some ways becomes unable to you know really act appropriately in the situation or ... very decreased performance\nI've defined choking as the worst performance then you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation\nAnd that's the on by luck I'm a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at the University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\n[noise] so I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people engaging regularly and we're we're most likely to choke\nI really think that any situation where there's expectations for a success concussions choking and it doesn't have\nTo be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching right or if you're in an elevator and\nYou're trying to figure out whether you're going to say something to the person next [laughter] you know we talk about these ethics moments of choking but it's a desire to perform at our best and situations in which were evaluated happening constantly\nGive me a little bit on the characteristics of those who are more and less prone to choke what about high IQ versus low IQ\nIn my research and in others we've shown perhaps counter intuitively that individuals who have the most ability to focus the most working memory that most fluid intelligence or actually more prone to perform poorly under stress and the idea is that\nIf you normally devote lots of cognitive resources to what you're doing and being in a pressure felt situation Rob CEO says resources you can't

why there's such a strong home field advantage in most sports the most plausible explanation is that referees are subconsciously influenced by the home crowd and may make one or two key calls in the

psychologist think about choking under pressure they consider a variety of for profit that may be subtle and hard to measure economists look at joking but differently\nSaid that you would have paid me a million dollar ... gave to best interview of the week ... is an economist at the University of California San Diego that would have made me very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this when we look at\nThe incentives in comics we think about\nTwo ways in which it's going to affect us the first is that you felt pay you more you're put more effort into task and the second assumption is that more effort will lead to better performance and that's not necessarily true and that's the part of choking might be that\nI can push you so much to to try so hard to really actually backfire immediately perform worse\nBeen easy coauthored one of the foundational economics papers on choking it's called large states and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including India\nThe reason we wanted to go to India is that the ... our money can go a long way so we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months' salary in our experiment if they did perfectly well\nEach participant completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead creative one was for example to pack pieces of metal into into books in an efficient way\nSome tasks we're cognitive and memory game in which I Would read up numbers you listen to me and then at some point do say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic\nThrowing a dark like candy bowls so balls on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars\nAnd ten daughter was about what they made in a month over there I open distributed me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make you work much harder riots and the question was are you going to be better actually when you work harder\nAs can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics the higher pay leads to more effort and more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nSo the findings were striking UC reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in lower success rate when the incentives were really high\nFor the three digit memory game roughly forty percent of the participants succeeded under low incentives under high instead of the success rate which is twenty percent\nFor the dark ballgame the success rate under low incentives was ten percent and runs seven percent under high incentives for the middle of packing game under low incentives twenty five percent of the participants succeeded\nUnder high incentives nobody succeeded or put another way at least twenty five percent of them choked\nActually were a bit surprised by this experiment because be included tasks in which we expected that effort will it will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure so can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks make us succumb to pressure\nThey ran some more experiments at MIT\nSponsorship of the cake you mean the live stream bite super micro Silicon Valley based manufacturer of energy efficient data center hardware solution celebrating twenty five years of growth and innovation learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nYeah the rewards here we're up to thirty dollars for the low incentive experiments and up to three hundred dollars for the high\nSo what we found is that for ...\nKeep pressing task when you increase the incentives from op too says she goes up to three hundred dollars they sweet for about a forty percent succeeding to eighty percent succeeding on the other end when you have to end up numbers more cognitive one we see a sharp decrease from\nSixty five percent to forty percent\nSo when you actually have to put some clumsy they're flipping through this getting day the incentives to be ridiculously high could actually be a better idea\n[noise] this would seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves some thinking we're more susceptible to choke core you've probably heard from a lot of people over the years coach and teachers and counselors of all sorts\nYou are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out in the way [noise]\nBut that's obviously harder than it sounds so how can you do that how can you prepare yourself to not crumble under the very circumstances that matter most\nHow do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic\nSee on ... again going back to her Gulf experiments\nSo we investigated whether going quicker for example um might help eliminate poor performance under pressure or I'm having one key swing thought that encapsulates your entire stroke\nMight be better um and we showed that some of that was successful and that leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess of your body up on on the back now you can say that was a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great ... so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else can you tell us about in this domain at least I'm learning to joke with\nWe also showed that getting used to this type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes with performance can be helpful so\nReally inoculated yourself against the high pressure situations you see this with students who practiced taking time pass a\nUC Davis with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions are going to perform under and you even see let's see if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players are used to what it's going to feel like to be in that big stadium um\nAnd this is true in really big important situations but it's it's also true in this little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it while people are watching you know um and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to the kinds of all eyes on you\nOkay so put yourself in realistic and stressful practice situations with him\nRethinking how you're feeling so we know that when people remind themselves that um that sweaty palms and beating heart aren't assign they're going to fail but a sign that they're awake and ready to go and their body is chanting important nutrients to their mind that can be really effective\nNow is that a charade or is that real I mean [laughter] if my palms are sweaty isn't an indication that I Am anxious and that\nIf I just tell myself well it's not really anxiety it's really my body sending nutrients I mean is that a a self lie that I'd profit from or is that realistically you know a counter truth\nFirst of all I Will just say that I'm I I liked placebo effects and [laughter] you know I don't know but I think it's a real truth because you know if your heart was impeding to some extent you'd be dead right um and those sweaty palms can be an indication that you're
