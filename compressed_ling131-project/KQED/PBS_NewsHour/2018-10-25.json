decision to try to lower some drug prices through Medicare is the biggest move yet by the administration to address the high cost of medicine in the U.S it is the latest in a series of policy changes from\nHis administration this year and it comes less than two weeks before the midterm elections and health care has become one of the top issues on the campaign trail William Brennan has our interview with the president's point man on this\nPresident Trump announced several parts of this plan today but here's the fundamental idea Medicare would change how much it pays for some of the most expensive drugs that seniors get a doctor's offices in hospitals\nThe new payments would be based on a benchmark index what's some other developed countries pay for the exact same drugs\nThis was all part of a pilot project for Medicare part B as it's called and it would be phased in over five years most of the other prescription drugs covered by Medicare known as Medicare part D would not be changed by today's move\nThe government is also trying to adjust to doctors incentives so they're not encouraged to prescribe the most expensive drugs\nAlex is our is the secretary of health and Human Services and he will be overseeing all of this and he joins me now welcome back to the news are thinking well I'm going to be here so the president sends a very big announcement today he referred to this as a revolutionary change can you explain the basics of of what this does\nYou bet so just this morning we release data showing that in our Medicare program where we pay for these infusion drugs these are the high cost drugs that physicians or hospitals administer to you\nWe are paying one hundred and eighty percent compared to what Europe and Japan are paying for these very same drugs and that can often be as high as five hundred percent higher than what they're getting why different because ... is voluntarily giving these other countries of comparable economic power\nVastly better deals we get a bill and we pay the bill actually with a six percent markup on top we're bringing competition with the system by\nReferencing those foreign prices and the deals farmers giving them now and\nBringing that to the benefit of Medicare and to the Medicare beneficiaries make twenty percent of the cost of these drugs out of pocket\nYou're saying if the Europeans and the Japanese and whoever else can pay X.\nIf the Europeans and the Japanese and whomever else can pay extra for this particular cancer drug we want to price similar to that as well\nYou bet 'cause right now in this part of the program this is a government health care program Medicare fee for service for our seniors and these position to minister drugs right now we set a price for it it's just a really stupid price it is the list price plus six percent and we're saying let's introduce some kind of competitive market based\nOther way of paying and what better way is there than to look at what these very pharma companies are willing to sell their product for two other similarly place countries and use that as a reference\nWhat about a concern that I have heard that\nIf we start asking the pharmaceutical companies to do this that they're going to go to all of those other European countries and say hey we're not giving you such a good deal anymore because they know that what they charge the pharmaceutical companies we're going to ask for the similar price and so that the Europeans and the Japanese and whoever else\nMight start being asked to pay more in that that could drive prices up here\nWhat we we actually hope that they will finally go to these other economic powers and say pay your fair share they have been free riding off of American investment in innovation and research over all these years we're we're producing most of the profits for farm and it's time for others to pay their fair share\nAs you mentioned this covers the drugs under Medicare part B which are these costly drugs that you've got basically your doctor gives to you in the hospital or in the doctor's office\nSet out of the blue that's a a an accusation can come out and ruined their life\nI'm with you

about my son I'm not because I feel that\nI'm more worried about if I had a daughter\nWould worry about my daughter I Would worry about her being believes and being hurt that would be a larger concern\nWhen you have a dog actually\nAnd a daughter by ... you get back to what Karen would say I what I Want it one of us who as people\nTo step away is when a Trump plant or a Trump nominee comes up I don't want us to assume that the other side is already against it I mean there's enough there's there's enough open mindedness to take a look at because for me as I'm a registered Democrat

of what we're taking a stab\nIs opinion is opinion and\nI think it does start at the top that that's my that's my problem since twenty sixteen is\nI feel like our neater when we have a fractured country or leader has pep rallies where he's calling me\nBasically an idiot he's calling me\nI think that we bring our country together will have to start at the grassroots\n'cause we're not getting it from the ... yeah that and I think it needs to start at the table\nAnd and around the dinner table and in our communities because we're not getting that\nThat a combined off from the top we're getting the opposite\nI Want to ask you to talk yeah the president\nUm thought our country needed to go on a different direction I thought that we're going in and entirely crazy direction and it was

heading in a in a better direction I Know there's a lot of the device of the country but I think a lot of it stems from this crazy anger that he actually won\nI and you know I Know we won and I know a lot of people don't like it when I Know he says a lot of offensive things and I wish she didn't have some times he would be a little bit more presidential but that's not who he is but I Do believe he loves the country\nTo my last question for you all is if you could just name a few words of what value you want in\nWhat the words what you want them to be\nHonesty truthful\nMoral ethical\nIntegrity
