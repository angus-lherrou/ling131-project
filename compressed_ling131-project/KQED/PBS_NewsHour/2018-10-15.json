so what the statement will say according\nTo the CNN report is that well how ... how long might have been aware of the rendition but wasn't responsible for the murder that's the distinction it seems

races or other Republicans seem to be holding their own Democrats have a better shot house races it seem contradictory ... talk a little bit about\nWhat ... what's going on yeah it's it's as if this election is taking place in two different countries the race for the Senate is taking place or at least for control of the Senate is taking place and really read parts of America\nThese are states that the president carried by more than Nineteen points in the twenties sixteen election so places like Montana or Missouri I'm North Dakota\nHouse is running through suburban America\nAnd in suburban America Trump is very unpopular\nSome of these districts he barely won some of them he narrowly lost but he is certainly very underwater in those suburban districts much more so than the places where he's going on the campaign trail Sony is fascinating to watch where he's going even when he goes to Pennsylvania\nHe went to Erie, Pennsylvania which is the one county that slipped\nFrom Obama carrying it to Trump carrying it\nOn notice Pennsylvania isn't on a targeted list for Republicans this year the Senate race\nLooks not very competitive democratic senator up there\nAnd the Democratic governor seems to be cruising right along as well instead it's just the places where he is really cheap rent with that are really the bread that he can do to those places that determines the twenty sixteen election Michigan Wisconsin Ohio Pennsylvania\nHe's not spending as much time there and Democrats are doing very well there at least statewide Democrats\nAnd ham what's happened to this enthusiasm gap that we liked it or enthusiast and whether it's a gaffe or not what's happened with that at one point that Democrats were had to Republicans caught up a little bit what are we looking at now how much of a\nOf a difference and making it it's really unclear right now whether this was a shift that was related to Kavanaugh\nWhether it is a an enduring shift or whether it is a shift that was going to happen as the election got closer people started paying more attention and Republicans came home um and I think that it's really hard right now to know exactly what it is\nYeah but it is I think that's I think that's right when I talked to Republicans they'd just consistently told me they just feel a lot better in these districts that are sort of congenitally read right that's where they didn't see that energy behind their Republican base\nA couple of weeks ago now they're starting to see it come home now is a cabinet ... is it just because Republicans\nThey know that election day is around the corner I'm the real challenge for Republicans right now though is that the Democratic enthusiasm had to wait wait I'm waned made for like a New Year's forever right it's there is intensity as they were better just isn't deterred and she also determined\nAnd we're spending a lotta time looking to wear independent voters are going and right now the Trump is somewhere around forty percent approval rating among independents you look at some of the most recent polls that came out today or this week the president um\nOr the the president still not doing well with independents and then you ask a question about who do you want to vote for for Congress independence breaking for Democrats by double digits that's where it gets very dangerous one Republican said to me\nWe can equal a turnout with Democrats but if we're losing independence by double digits we're still in deep doo doo and that's the challenge\nIs so and we've also been talking about whether there was a gender piece of the story and that's something we've addressed in the past but Tam today there was this back and forth between Elizabeth Warren who for whom it was released her DNA testing test results\nWere made public it turns out she does have some Native American blood going back six to ten\nGeneration the president to that of course it challenged her to do this to make a long story short um had said he would donate a million dollars now he's saying he wouldn't do it and what he did it [laughter] it's just I mean I how long it's going to\nEnd up having to exactly what it does this go anywhere it is it are women voters should it is it's a little early for twenty twenty isn't it it's a little early for twenty twenty but if you watch the video that Elizabeth Warren put out\nTo go along with these test results there is no denying that that is a very slick campaign video introducing herself to America\nOr re introducing herself to America\nAt one thing about Elizabeth Warren and President Trump this is a rivalry that goes back a very long way on the twenty sixteen campaign trail when Elizabeth Warren was campaigning for Hillary Clinton she had a unique ability to sort of troll\nCandidate Trump to to get him to say thing got under his skin he got under his skin and and then along comes his term that he keeps using for Elizabeth Warren the Pocahontas term\nUm ... which many people find wildly offensive but in the end President Trump picks these feuds and fights with all of these people and and somehow the people he feuds with end up being the ones that are sullied and he just keeps going\nJust twenty seconds Amy I guess it's never too early to talk about twenty twenty\nAnd there are a lot of Democrats some of whom I talked to today who would like Democrats not to talk about twenty twenty\nSome of them I talk to you today who would like Democrats not to talk about twenty twenty and they said they were doing really well\n... we got our sights on
