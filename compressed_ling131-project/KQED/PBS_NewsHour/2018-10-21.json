learn more it for Mike Rowe dot com\nNow you know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe the drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans once you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many ... corn products is could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there are fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs took like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself lights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\nGet any like what you were saying earlier ally that has to do with with the fact that like we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this can go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think a mock Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the be succeeding before six and a few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly Reagan until dinnertime and do whatever but you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had her broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals that of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you'll live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating on natural demands were not orange craving whoppers for Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for better diet for everyone that's the hard part but\nBy improving our own and that happens to be quite easy to simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals where would do is not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nBut more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise]\nFood writer mark fit men you can see his entire attack at ten dot com [noise] um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing and I say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next [laughter] who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\n... bad the great uses sardines are great how can you not eat pasta why the hell we can get sweet potato pasta which is why we shouldn't have any of them a housing bust who's gonna kill ya\nMarket messing that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you have to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate Seventy four percent ... Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spike with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert ... is a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco\nSo there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... which in a digital them or are that's even famous now apple\nPuree or evaporated canes you yeah my favorite because changes so you know just healthy right what happens when you evaporate change if you get sugar [noise]\n... studies sugar how they managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet because\nIt's cheaper it's portable it's\nConvenient kids like it and it's addictive\nAnd like any addictive substance ... says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much of it has rubber less taken on the head stage\nAnd here technologies location intelligence company with a scalable and flexible location platform designed to power the emerging technologies of today and tomorrow learn more at here dot com slash new reality\nThe votes are in don't miss the finale of the great American read to find out which book when the title of America's most ... novel catch the program Tuesday night at eight I'm K. key weedy public television nine [noise]\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from life luck lifelike with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber criminals learn more at life lock dot com [noise]\nFrom twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nAnd from the doors do charitable foundation who is clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nIt's that Ted radio hour for NPR I'm Guy Raj and I'm sure it's a food\nWhy we eat what we eat and why our food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates\nWe all think we taste food and ... and yeah that's an illusion in the sense that are most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the two of somebody are actually being vacated by nostrils but our brains things wonderful job of been truly watching\nThe information I get from my nose and making me believe it's coming from I ...\nThis is Charles Spence a head of the ... research liberal tree Oxford University what does the cross medical research laboratory [noise]\nI'm a celebrity here in the psychology department where we look at how the senses interact\nAnd gas are mouse and knows interact when we eat but said or mouse and our ears\nWere doing experiments where we're feeding people up potato chips out each time they been into a potato chip we would change the sound they could sometimes making their own crunching ... [noise]\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel showed up as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas the conscience of freshness of these other attributes that\nTrump says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might ... white wine ... with an odorless tasteless food dye\nAnd they've done a pretty pretty you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spouting leaving tasting what they think because of red wine all the rumors are near the cat in the dark chocolates mistaken fruits and so I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about\nThe ingredients here's Charles stats on the stage\nAhead this morning to tell you about the perfect meal\nWill convince we can taste the food we enjoy the flame was in a room with the wind in the blast\nReflect what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how the measures have a tendency among scientists like when you're a guest thrown it it's just that people like your eye and brain gotta give them something to eat something to drink and see which parts of the brain light up this is going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nIs one problem here which is in fact if their measures off one of these rights governments can log on your back where they had ... spelled with a Cuban you'll ...\nPeriodically squid sin or some drink you're going to be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that ... that the brains down alignment but it tells you something how something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those questions [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal [laughter]\nI was actually a different for each and every one of us may company with some very very simple it can be fishing ships by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUh I Know one of the perfect meal when the fighting with that part in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with doesn't resonate and then you can never quite capture when you get back to me as your mood you're putting relax your holiday less stressed Tripoli with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met a friend who's just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I Try to increase and then you try it and you were sort\nOf thinking that phenomenon how to name it we've all learned versions of it um I was going to problem solve rose a paradox that they use to describe a northern Europeans um but to\nOur dogs as they used to describe a northern Europeans um meticulously who gave for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nUh nothing's some well or on the side of the sea suffering not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells the Soviets all out and not tasteless either ... said why you've ever had so great that you want to buy a box or a case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you happen and you bring it back and then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap birthday yeah as you say well how is it something about when they when they are playing with a cold and not you know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat no drink no way I Will always\nSomewhere in a certain environments in certain states of mind on all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impact what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it\nAnd we saw in a way to miss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation and put some of that pledge of into what we think about the food [noise]\nIn fact just Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nIt's been a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood they never tasted good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wine glass but all brain has brought me everything else and the thousands of a single the smell of the salt in the ah the walls of the song by all of that is play against the reruns\nOn top chef capturing that insight into dishes like a\nStudy that too much to install restaurant in in Switzerland tuition star restaurant\nA white table cloths but not popular on the table with no glasses and I play like nothing it's just a plastic car people wait say what he calls me seven o'clock hour here um everyone's here in the restaurant and I can deal with tables the full nothing will happen until\nSomebody picks up here a state that plastic how\nI Want to pick it up you know there are a\nLittle ... euro tower and it makes it sound as soon as some of those types of it that would be laughing and then even guaranteed within a minute you'll have the whole restaurant pull of moving fires laughing ... and ... is the moment when the first is comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in the mood and he knows that will improve even with high\nOf a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\n[noise] wow so it's like from from a neurological perspective do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[laughter] uh no so we don't know that it does happen but it is the case\nIt's all kind of classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with direction because there's a few stuff here in London and he's being I'm sending our question I asked for several weeks have to be living his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of construction something they don't have the experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details I think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do do they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that is totally absurd all about the food and the taste of food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days just the sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but you say okay so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food remarried plastic cutlery non as a silver and where's your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at nature\nSo the the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly you can never sort of ... through just by south it's always on something in a certain environment\nAnd there's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now popping up starting up\nTheir own venues who who are really thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind but those that were swimming [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book it's called the perfect meal you\nCan see his entire talk and head at NPR had already\nSaid let's get ... still a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's what ... does [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PBS NewsHour", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "21"}
