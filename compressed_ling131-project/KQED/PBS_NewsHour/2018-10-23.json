no matter how cruel or how difficult a welcome at the United states for the\nThe overwhelming need they feel that she a mixture of fighting corruption unemployment political idea yet and how you're really in what way up on that mind\nPresident Trump's escalating rhetoric like at this taxes rally last night had brought this year's caravans to the forefront of the immigration debate two weeks out of the midterm elections\nYou know what's happening right now as\nA large group of people they take care of it\nI think the Democrats have something to do with it and I think we made a mistake because these are seeing how bad it is [noise]\nMeanwhile the migrants continue their journey mostly on flood and now over a thousand miles from the nearest us border crossing\nPicking it up from there to discuss some of the rhetoric and policy surrounding all of this is Alan Gomez is immigration reporter for USA Today Alan Gomez welcome back to the news hour we heard the president\nSponsorship as the cake you weedy life's dream bike city from Comcast with extended ... customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device with extended beyond demand\n[noise] not that his administration can point to as of yet um we've been asking an apartment of homeland security\nEver since we started making those claims in a series of tweets um what were the proof was that there were members of gangs criminals um as he refers just generally as middle Easterners\nIn the group and they haven't been able to point out any examples or any proof that anybody exist instead what they're doing is they're falling back on percentages um they've been passing out data of the number of criminals gang members and people from quote special interests countries who have been caught\nTrying to cross the border illegally over the past year\nUm when you put those numbers in the context that shows that about five percent of people caught along the border\nUm are have some kind of criminal background about zero point three percent are gang members and about zero point eight percent come from special interest countries that include some Middle Eastern countries um but so they're saying face the numbers indicate that there has to be in that group and vice president\nPence made that same claimed that it if you look at the size of this there just has to be some of those folks in there I'm In the last hour we've heard from the department of homeland security that they are confirming that there are some criminals and some middle Easterners and there are we followed up with them but I haven't heard anything back\nYou know the president's focus on this as a candidate elevated it fits actually there's and Karen and in the past one earlier this year ... you know in the entire immigration landscape which are so deeply as this one event caught the president's attention so strongly\nTiming where just about two weeks away from the election and basic this falls into his rhetoric so perfectly um these is basically taking a page out of his twenty six paying a presidential campaign and just riling up on immigration right now this was an issue that ... that the twenty sixteen election proved\nIs one that will rile up his base is one that appeals to them as one that interest them um is one that scares them\nUm and so the timing of this the idea that for the next two weeks because of the caravan will it's a slow march they're walking there's still well over a thousand miles away from the border the fact that these images will be aired on TV repeatedly for these next two weeks\nIs perfect for him because it shows this idea\nOf an invasion as he likes to call it I've been watching um congressional debates around the country and house districts in small in states like Idaho Iowa Minnesota and in in Pittsburgh and the north east you hear the Honduran caravan coming up repeatedly because it's something that Republicans realize it's something that can Energizer face\nAlley that USA Today if Congress immigration there are going to have to leave it there thank you very much for your time [noise]\n\nPresident Trump's comments about that immigrant caravan during a rally last night in Houston were seized upon by fact checkers including at the Toronto Star newspaper\nThey've tracked over twenty nine hundred claims the president has made since he took office almost two years ago that cannot be borne out by facts that is more than four false claims a day on average\nAnnual Dale is the Washington bureau chief for the Toronto Star\nAnd he joins me now thank you for being here thank you and your damn you've covered the White House closely and I know there's been attention paid to what the president says that remarks that cannot be borne out by ... since he took office but you've observed that there's more of this taking place now\nYeah we've we've gone to fight it and so in twenty Seventeen he average two point nine false claims per day\nAs of now it's four point five false claims per day there was more than five\nPer day in twenty Eighteen and it escalated even further as we've gotten closer to the new trend though every successive month June July August and September set a new record for the president's false claims so over time he's getting more dishonest\n[noise] um this started out her interview just now are asking about the president's intention that there are people of Middle Eastern descent in that migrant caravan we heard a a reporter Alan ... say there's no evidence of that but there are other comments the president's made about immigration for example he's talked about Democrats\nPaying to get that migrant caravan started at Democrats in the United states he's made the statement is there any evidence of this\nNo I'm I'm comfortable calling that alive there's simply no validity there is no basis for that whatsoever\nAnd I should say we at the news hour a ton about inaccurate statements false statements you're comfortable using the word lie why\nBecause I think that's the only accurate word for some of the claims he make I also sometimes described his claims as false claims sometimes we don't know if he's a confused if he's innocent air but in other cases it's clear that he's simply\nFabricated competing for example he claimed at one point that the head of the boy scouts had called him and said to his speech to the boy scouts was the best speech\nEver given to the boy scout ... the boy scouts told me no one ever spoke to him no one ever called him no one ever said that and so in a case like that I think in our in our regular lives I think the word we use is live so I think we as journalists should use it in articles as well\nAnother couple of comments the president's made about immigration he spoke and just I think just last night again about\nA he said illegal immigrants in California are voting or in the in this upcoming a midterm election in California and I is there evidence that this is going on and early voting in California\nYou know there there was no evidence for this and this is the ...\nScouts was the best speech ever given to the boy scout Danbury the boy scouts told me no one ever spoke to him no one ever called him no one ever said that and so when a case like that I think in our in our regular lives I think the word we would you lie so I think we as journalists should use it in articles as well\nAnother couple of comments the president's made about immigration he spoke and just I think just last night again about\nA he said illegal immigrants in California are voting or in the in this upcoming uh mid term election in California or is there evidence that this has been going on and early voting and California\nAnd know that there is no evidence for this and this is the claim that the president has made about about elections in general and it's something he said since his own election that despite what everyone says what every expert says illegal immigrants are voting on math he's simply knows them and again this in my view is alive there is no evidence for whatsoever\nAnd other another comment the president may die at a rally this was at a rally in Nevada on Saturday he spoke about what he just turned anti immigrant anti immigration riots happening in California I Want to play for the audience what he\nSat on Saturday I don't think we like sex\nYour city's up [noise] by the way a lot of people don't want to me that they want to get out of this big\nOf a lot of these sites sure as you've been hearing about it on you and other places in California they want to get out there demanding they'd be released from sanctuary cities\nBut as far as we know Daniel down there is no evidence of this is that right\nTo the latest battle over Obamacare or the federal health care law formerly known as the Affordable CARE Act the Trump Administration announced yesterday that it will allow states to go ahead with the sale of cheaper and stay in the air health insurance plans but some of the\nBunker shift as the cake you read the live stream city from Comcast with extended customers can watch TV anytime anywhere on any device was extended beyond demand\nAnd as William Bram tells us that could play right into a major election fight over that issue\nYesterday the Trump Administration gave states new flexibility with their health care plans allowing them to use federal subsidies for cheaper plans that come with fewer required benefits for example we can know subsidized plans or don't have to cover prescription drugs or mental health or maternity care all things that the Affordable CARE Act required\nIn these plants could also deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions as long as consumers still had access to another more comprehensive plan that guarantees that coverage\nYou sound like small changes but they're not they will take effect starting twenty twenty President Trump and many Republicans contend with these new options or exactly what some consumers want\nBut this comes as support for parts of Obamacare are growing at least one poll recently found a majority of voters say healthcare is very important in making their decisions come November Margot singer cats covers all this\nFor the New York times and she joins me now welcome back thank you for having me so help us understand what the Trump Administration announced yesterday what are these changes and what do they mean\nSo this is something that was only then Obamacare there is a provision that allows states to apply to do a totally different system if they want but they have to\nAdhere to certain guard rails to make sure that they're not taking coverage away from people who would have otherwise gotten it\nAnd the Trump Administration put out new rules for that process where they basically said we are going to be much more open minded about letting states throw out all the Obamacare roles and come up with their own way of managing their insurance marketplaces so this could include allowing plans that cover a fewer benefits maybe don't cover prescription drugs are mental health care\nUp they also including plans that maybe are not available to people with preexisting conditions are not available to them at the same price as for other customers\nAnd all kinds of other changes you know maybe the who gets a subsidy for what could change so we don't know what they're going to do but states are not welcome to bring these proposals forward and the Trump Administration has said that they are open to approve a mom\nAnd there's the concern that if federal subsidies now can be seen as another encouragement to people to buy these plans that people might be getting a plan that they think covers them but then when a crisis which they don't really have coverage\nYeah I think there are two concerts and they're both important so one is just that that people may buy a plan and they're healthy when they buy it and they don't really understand the fine print and they think it's at that plant and then\nBoom their kid gets an illness or they developed cancer or a drug addiction and suddenly when they realized and they need those benefits that they're not there so there is concern that these plans to cover the were things that have more exclusions could have holes for individual consumers and then I think there's a broader concern which is\nThat kind of cheaper plan that covers last that might be good for someone who is healthy and never has any health conditions and was never going to use their health insurance anyway\nBut for someone who has a pre existing illness they're never going to buy that plan it's not going to be available for them it's not going to cover the benefits that they need and so what it does it sets up these two side by side markets where all of the people with preexisting conditions by the sort of comprehensive Obamacare plans and\nA lot healthier people are willing to roll the dice on these cheaper plans\nAnd what can happen is that because the way insurance works as we're sort of all pooling our premiums together to cover our collective health felt he loved one full over here where all the sick people are and another one over here with all the healthy people\nAt the price for buying insurance for sick people could get really really high and that could make an affordable for a lot of people who really need insurance and us\nAs we have seen there are people over the country who are struggling to pay their bills my colleagues wrote in Idaho recently and I met a young woman who is because we can't afford or health care and she's desperate she sounds like she'd be an ideal customer for a cheaper maybe skip your plan listen to what you have to say\nI absolutely would try again for health insurance and actually every year when the enrollment comes up I Try hoping for a miracle that there is going to be a plan I can\nAfford I I've never given up I Try every year and and then every year it hasn't worked out so absolutely I Would I Would look at it again and if there's plans out as early as next week I'll I'll look into it next week\nI mean this was a real issue for a lot of people it really hasn't\nI talked to these people all the time it is true that Obamacare made health insurance a lot more affordable for low and middle income people made it more accessible for people with prior\nIllnesses that for a lot of people who make what we would consider to be middle class incomes but don't qualify for a subsidy his insurance plans can be really expensive and they can be unaffordable and we know that those people have been dropping out of the market and they're going without anything and so I think that policymakers and the Trump Administration are trying to be sensitive to the population and say okay meaning of his\nSkin the our plans aren't quite as good I don't have all the same consumer protections and benefits as an Obamacare plan but if people are choosing between us and nothing isn't it better to give them some things in the air and let them decide what's the right plan for that and\nConsumer advocates I think on the other hand are very concerned about people sort of falling through the cracks and again about the segmentation at the market but I think that you know this person in Idaho is really speaking to a real problem that we see in the country because health insurance is just so expensive it's quiet out of reach for a lot of people\nWant to separate but related issue the issue of preexisting conditions since become nationally a very big political issue in the lead up to the terms\nA show you to excerpts of of some ads that are running in Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill and her opponent\nOr energy Josh Hawley took a look at these\nTwo years ago I beat breast cancer\nThousands of other women in Missouri I don't talk about it much but those who face cancer and many other illnesses have a pre existing conditions when it comes to health coverage unfortunately Josh highly filed a lawsuit letting insurance companies deny coverage for those with preexisting conditions\nThat's just wrong earlier this year we learned our oldest were growing up\nKaren it's not the only way that you could take care of these people but it's the way that we do it now in our law\nAnd when Republicans got really serious about repealing a fireball ... last year I think that suddenly this law that had been very controversial and had been pretty unpopular\nPeople started to suddenly look at it differently and we saw in the public opinion polls for the first time that more people supported the Affordable CARE Act I don't want it repealed and that is a shift that has persisted and we saw a lot of engagement by kind of democratic activists by disease advocacy group of people who are lobbying on the hill organizing at home\nAnd it has become this really central issue for Democrats to say you know we have to pay for daycare act where suddenly proud of it\nAnd we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions you look around the country this is a number one issue for Democrats there are more ads on health care than any other subject polling has consistently shown that health care as if not the most important issue the second most important issue to voters in battleground states and all around the country\nAnd I think Republicans now are kind of floundering a little bit defined what their answer is going to be to this problem and we see a lot of ads now and statements from Republican candidates like Josh Hawley fad where Republican candidates even those who have voted for the amount of care repeal proposals on health or who\nLike Josh Hawley a part of a lawsuit that would seek to\nRepeal the Affordable CARE Act through the courts that they are saying no no I'm Still committed to pre existing conditions I think it's a little bit hard\nTo believe what they're saying even though I think there are possible ways that they could achieve that because they have not been very specific about how they would do it and we have them on the record as opposed to the way that Democrats have achieved it\nAll right Margot singer cats as always thank you very much ... than [noise]\nNow how one state awards college credit for military
