FBI pros sold out of Washington for a ...\nWho do much to give a little leeway because of what who's been through but on the other hand we can't have this on the court we simply can't\nBut most Republicans took aim at the Democrats\nWill if you were accused falsely\nAre committing a crime wouldn't you be angry too when you want to clear your good moon\nWell that's exactly what judge Calvin or do they call him a lying\nDraw a sexual predator and the man defending show than as a result or should he doesn't have to be on the Supreme Court in such a verbal\nDemocrats said today they want an FBI briefing at least twenty four hours before any vote California Senator Dianne Feinstein is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee\nWe have to put all the facts together yeah and this is is this and I guess that's my tenth Supreme Court hearing that I sat on and there's never been one likes him with the issues like this\nBut a key undecided Republican Alaska's Lisa Murkowski said she is not concerned that the process of moving too quickly did as a leader McConnell vowed again to fold a cabinet level this week I mean I'm a lawyer for Kavanaugh's high school friend mark judge and today the FBI has now completed his interview\nAnd Lisa joins me now along with our White House correspondent youngish I'll send or hello to both of you another busy day Lisa uh what do we know right now about timing about when this FBI investigation will finish and when there can be a final vote on Kavanaugh in\nThe Senate right the FBI was given up to one week that ends friday to do this investigation they couldn't finish earlier some Republican senators think they may finished earlier that couldn't be Wednesday Thursday\nI'm In the meantime there are some key witnesses that have not yet been I'm interviewing in particular Christine Blasey Ford team sent out a letter tonight saying they've been trying to get in touch with the FBI they have not heard back since one phone call on friday and they say they are concerned that the FBI may not interview her at all\nWe're not really sure the FBI is not really obviously revealing what their plan is sometimes key witnesses are needed last we have to wait and see on that how that goes meanwhile Mitch McConnell would like to have this final vote this week this week means Saturday I fly\nAnd the way that would work because of the Senate rules there's a series of procedural hurdles they have to clear the big vote is a procedural vote called cloture in order to have that cloture vote Judy McConnell much file that motion and then you wait two days for that vote so he files that motion tomorrow as we expect\nThe Senate could have that heat procedural vote on friday\nThat the McConnell one now what happened did you have to watch these key undecided senators to see if they want more time to read the FBI report McConnell said he wants them to read it quickly once they get it I don't know that they will want to do that also will report being made public another question unanswered right now number\nA number of questions meantime image the president does seem to be sticking with Brett Kavanaugh why\nThis political nomination has really become a cause celebrate for a lot of Republicans the president said that he went to a rally um this week in Tennessee and that he heard from so many people Republicans people who support or who want him to keep fighting for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd President Trump loves to go to these rallies around the country and really listen to his base and really check check what they're thinking it's kind of the way that he looks at polling\nSo the fact that he is continuing to hear from people who say he should stick by Brett Kavanaugh and the president really feels this way personally because he feels as though the Democrats couldn't Denton bears him if he has to withdraw this nomination\n[noise] and and Lisa I'm you know picking up on that and give us more of a sense of the temperature in the Senate are Republicans the only way we heard what McConnell one Senator McConnell a Senator Kennedy and others are saying are they feeling pressure in any way to rethink this they are\nFeeling frustration that they think the conversation has changed from whether this person or can be proven to have sexually assaulted someone which they say he absolutely that cannot be proven\nTo a question of how did he lied about his drinking and does he have the temperament they don't think those are appropriate question to judge this nominee by however that is the conversation right now\nBut I had Judy I'm not sure that matters at all all that matters is what three senators Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins think of all of that they're taking it and I think they're honestly waiting for this report to come out\nAnd says three Republicans and finally image we heard the president say say today among other things he said these are scary times for a young man what's the background\nThere the background is that the president and other people are wondering if need to have gone too far and if whether or not young men are now in a tradition where they might be accused falsely of things that they didn't do and then have\nTo be essentially said that they were that they're guilty until proven innocent\nDonald Trump junior who's been very vocal the president\nHas said that he's more concerned about his sons and his daughter after hearing about Brett Kavanaugh allegation because he thinks that they're young men out there who can could essentially have their lives ruined\nBy by false allegations of course add to that the fact that the president's dealing with his own sexual assault allegation there are dozens of women who said the president acted inappropriately sexually\nAnd they he was getting old and he he had very little doubt on the buildings and he had mountains of cash in these buildings and the the children realize that if he died at some point he was getting to be a you know in his eighties that they would be stuck with paying fifty five percent inheritance tax on the money\nSo what they did is they created a company it was called all county building supply um and they were they were shareholders of it and what they did was Fred Trump is part of running the buildings had to buy everything from you know boilers paint 'em plumbing supplies all this stuff\nAnd he would pay vendors for it and one day all county started buying it they would pay the vendors and then they would send a separate chalk up to their dad and it would be padded anywhere from twenty to fifty percent\nAnd so ... and they and they and they would pocket the difference and then the interesting thing about that if they would then pocket the difference and then separately they use these padded receipts\nAnd they sent them and they use them to justify the padded receipts to justify wrench increases on their tenets that we're living in rent regulated buildings we have the receipts where they did this and we also have testimony from depositions we obtain where they say they did this\nAnd and you're in other words they went to it quite elaborate steps they took a extraordinary steps to avoid paying additional millions and millions of dollars in taxes\nThey took elaborate steps in that case it's a pretty straightforward seeing that's kind of gangster ask I mean it's like one day you're paying him now you're paying me and it's twenty percent more in just happen to be their father and they were able to turn doing this they were able to drain that cash that he was sitting on his buildings were sitting on you know tens and tens of millions which we saw when we started looking at\nThe financial documents and how they were able to take it out to avoid the fifty five percent um estate or death taxes they call it\nI mean that's kind of the main one that we found that was emblematic of some of the other things that we are going on\nShe's and Craig among other things you write that Fred Trump Trump the president's father was relentless in creative in finding ways to channel his wealth to his children\nUm what was President Trump's role in that\nWell if he was he was a for many years of his life or recipients incredible when we started digging into it not only were their trust funds but Fred Trump over his life he made he made his children\nUm his bankers instead of loan it instead of borrowing money from bank he would borrow money from them they had money and trust they would set up loans and he would pay them interest\nUm he paid Donald Trump consulting fees there was just these these incredible streams of revenue that were coming from Fred Trump to his tune as kids in order to get money to them\nAnd and are you able to identify in the peace what is out now potentially illegal and what was just on the edge of what might have been legal\nWe do the one that I mentioned in a note you know as far as we're concerned I Would note fraud and not only um you know was the ... county the one where they were rolling the money out of out of the buildings\nThey've been passed um they passed some of the burden on to their to their tenants and that sort of goes into things including wire fraud according to the people that we've talked to and then there was other things that they did I'm with her father's estate I'm the boss border on tax avoidance tax evasion and tax fraud and in one instance just a simple example\nI'm Donald Trump Pence and his siblings or Robert trumping and Marion Barry Trump they signed off on their father's estate and in doing so they have to verify the accuracy\nOf all the gift turns ... returns that were submitted some of those had um had things like they did the the gifts they knew that they had gotten from all county they didn't disclose them and so that becomes again another another potential crime that they committed\nAnd as you say on this uh fights the narrative from the president that he uh made a made millions on his own that he inherited ...\nThat that's and that's one of the incredible things is just a story of a father and his son in this relationship\nThat they had 'em through the years and and just how Donald Trump created this narrative you know and then when he was in Nineteen Seventy six when he was not far out of work and that he basically appropriated his father's um wealth in his own and newspaper stories he made a huge splash in Manhattan I'm I'm worth hundreds of millions of dollars\nNothing could have been further from the truth that was from Trump's money\n[noise] Suzanne ... extraordinary reporting thirty eight pages or when you print it out of the New York times thank you\nThank you [noise]\n\nAnd now we returned to new questions about judge Brett Kavanaugh's pass and the future of his confirmation battle in the Senate\nSenator Chris Coons a Democrat from Delaware and he serves on the Senate Judiciary committee senator thank you for joining us again what do you know at this point about the state of the FBI investigation this supplemental investigation\nI'm Judy I Know that it's ongoing I Know that agents have been investigating an interviewing people over the last couple of days I Do not know what the exact scope is of this investigation or when they intend to bring it to a close\nWell as our at least in Asia now report it a few minutes ago uh there's now a letter from\nMinutes ago uh there's now a letter from a doctor ... forge attorneys or to the FBI saying that none of their the information they've offered their phone calls have not been\nA return the information they've offered to turn over has not that the FBI hasn't taken him up on that what's your understanding of their efforts to to seek any further information from Dr blessing for\nI don't have direct knowledge of this from the FBI I'm obviously\nUm but I think that um both judge Kavanaugh and Dr Ford um should have been questions or early in this process and then the other individuals who've made allegations against a judge Kavanaugh or a documents that were brought forward in last week's a Senate Judiciary committee testimony last Thursday\nI'm should be used as a basis for further investigation I was concerned Judy last Sunday when there were press reports that the entire investigation was going to consist of questioning for individual\nAnd that would be yes um I certainly had imagined\nA broader more open more Folsom investigation this week\nUm and I was encouraged when President Trump said that he had directed at the White House counsel Don McGahn to say that the FBI should be free to pursue a all reasonable investigatory lead on this week I'm as they pursue the credible claims in front of the Judiciary Committee\nUm I don't think we'll know exactly how many people were interviewed and by whom are into friday but I also have tried to refer forward to the FBI of people who've contacted via office I'm not voting for the credibility of their claims I'm just trying to make sure that we're doing our job in passing them\nForward properly and I have found that process a little difficult\nSo how will you know when you see or a ... at some point you will see the results of the FBI's work how will you know that they've done a thorough investigation that you believe there should have\nWell to be clear this is in the nature of a compromise Judy I'm if I were designing an FBI a follow up background investigation to the allegations against judge Kavanaugh it would last much longer and be much broader than what I suspect we'll be accomplished this week um but I asked\nA I implored my good friend and colleague Senator Jeff flake um last friday to consider a one week pause and to allow the FBI to investigate the allegations that we're right in front of us at that point um that's what I've worked hard in the last couple of days to make sure happens that's what\nI Believe a Republican senators are working to make happen and the FBI has a lot of resources and a lot of agents that are capable of pursuing parallel investigations are they should be able to interview dozens of people in a week um but I don't know exactly how broad the scope will be and I'm not sure what will be in the final report\nThat the Senate should receive this Friday\nWhat is your read on your Republican colleagues who have not declared themselves yet on a on judge Kavanaugh on on whether they're whether they're open to uh not supporting his nomination if uh if if they don't if they don't feel satisfied by the results of this investigation\nWell Judy I'm I'm not going to characterize recent conversations but I'll say that publicly you know last week um they said I'm a few key Republican senators that if there were not\nA a one week paused for the FBI to investigate the allegations in front of the committee than they weren't comfortable of voting for cloture voting to move ahead with his confirmation um so it's my expectation that's what precipitated this week\nUm I did published an editorial today a in a newspaper here in Washington\nI'm that lays out what I Would expect would be in that FBI background investigation up but I think what has move this forward and what I'm what I'm grateful for um is the assertion by a few undecided Republican senators that they thought there were allegations in front of the committee\nThat deserve to be investigated either to clear judge Kavanaugh of these allegations for to corroborate\nThe allegations made by doctor for ... and others\nSenator he you know there's more conversation now about um truth and temperament about uh whether judge Kavanaugh at here and to um what is known to be the facts the truth when he was testifying about his own his own past and the temperament or that he dislikes are those\nThe situation is particularly dire for migrants Libya is a major gateway for Africans en route to Europe and
