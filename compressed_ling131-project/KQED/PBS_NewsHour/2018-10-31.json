I think if the ... the size to remove him he\nAh he has the authority to do so and nobody would object genes or moved to other conferences before him so uh is there pressure for that I don't think internally there's pressure for about\nA certainly externally a there is a lot of\nPressure for though Robin Wright mounting extra low pressure but also internal pressure for now\nI think there is but I didn't tell mine has also consolidated power as knowing beforehand ever managed to do except for the founder he\nTook over the intelligence and military apparatus he's head of the economic council he is head of the royal court and so the idea that there could be divisions within that could challenge him I think it's more difficult than in the past\nAh but it really depends on how much pressure the royal family particularly the king himself\nFeels to weather as we can the powers of the crown prince replace him a there are a number of different options including bringing others who might share power take over some of his portfolio on put him in check in effect that he isn't the only power in the kingdom\nAmong funny we just saw prints off med return the kings brother uh is that an attempt to consolidate power around up there\nI think a prince committed a very important figure she's a notch or number two after getting some on how the process going lateral instead of vertical\nThe wait at the top and this time a for passing the throne of Saudi Arabia backing a prince Sacramento has a lot of support internally from the drives the religious establishment\nOf the commercial glasses I think that in turn of of Brits from it it's very important for the consolidation\nOf power and making a\nBasically a beginning a for the base which is the ruling family and religious establishment and emotion\nClass so he will support him yes it's a live in a much more complicated than that I think he would support the king but I'm not sure if he would support a the crown prince Robin Wright can print offered help circle the wagons\nOh I think he's already began to do that I think he's gaming his future already uh what was really interesting is that he showed up at the airport to greet prints on the edge\nOf it in some on showed up that degree print someone\nAnd sit and parents on it yes and it's very interesting I think that he's doing those things that tried to show that he's still in power that he's still popular and I think he really was popular among the young before this happened you look at the way it was created in the United states I think that\nShow the merger murder has in many ways backfired in ways that he he never anyone who was linked to it ever envisioned so I think the crown prince is a feeling vulnerable and trying to do those things that will lift his profile and show that he's in control and not I'm not associated with this murder\nOr who founded the crown prince is vulnerable as Robin Wright said or is that why we are seeing this pressure from the United states over the war in Yemen or or is it just a a confluence of events the un has been saying that the ceasefire needs to begin in November\nIt's both a confluence of events and I agree with that often I think basically the the conference this week is a point now at ease and\nBurns these week is a point now it used internationally a five and ... in Saudi Arabia neck there hold legitimacy question rests with the king himself of the king\nHas the whole authority is is the ... of the conference comes from being the son of the cooking and whatever the king this SARS thing the whole family would go with him and the whole country would go with\nIt they're unprecedented pressure over Yemen because of these two statements by the restaurant that\nI think this is the potential for a deal that this is where the kingdom or particularly the crown prince has to back off his most aggressive foreign policy a campaign and come up with a compromise whether it's spending airstrikes that have been so deadly on civilian\nWhether it's a tried to or green to go to peace talks under un offices\nThat there'll be something to try to move toward the end and remember\nEven is racial also under pressure because Republican congressman and now that let's not have a dialogue with Saudi Arabia anymore that's a lot of pressure\nWithin the administration within

going to talk about one of these cases and that the larger picture here beyond just one company ... had a miscarriage while employed at the warehouse in Memphis shortly before ... feel about it in twenty fourteen she's now with the Teamsters which is trying to organize a union at the same warehouse\nAnd for ... graves is the c._e._o. of the national Women's Law center welcome to both and that and\nI'm ... I Wonder if you could just start off by telling us a little bit about what happened with you I Know you were working in this warehouse while you were pregnant back in twenty four team what kind of work were you doing back then\nWe um process boxes process um items that um come down a conveyor belt or rather its phones tablets um gadgets or whatnot isn't very challenging um\nIs very hot and they'd be all day and we do not have air or we live by says forty five pounds more and more um\nAnd that's picking them up and live in them\nAnd I understand that the time but this was causing some discomfort for you how did you did you express that your supervisor\nAbsolutely on February autonomy fourteen I found out that I was pregnant I merely immediately went to the doctor he could on my doctor is no no heavy lifting my supervisor saw that no\nBut she disregarded there now because she steals sent me to areas where I had when I had to pick up forty five pound boxes and heavier losses\nSo you you're saying that you went to the supervisor and said look I've got a doctor's note saying I'm not supposed to lift heavy things can I Do something different what was what was the supervisors reaction\nYes I did a request um flight duty because it is light duty or that company\nAccommodate who they want to accommodate um so I did ask for light duty and I did on sale not supervising that I could not live heavy boxes she said to me that I should have an abortion\nAnd I just looked at her 'cause I was so shocked that she told me to have a freaking abortion\nSo she eventually walked away from me I stayed at work maybe Fifteen minutes later I was hurting so bad I went I went to sleep but when I got up the next morning my matches it was like dressed in blood\nOn my husband was there my onto kids was there\nAnd there were like mom what's wrong with my husband was like so shocked he didn't know what to do you know me crying in pain so he rushed me to the E R um I got to the ER and\nThe doctor examined me in shape me and everything he was like sorry I'm missing the rail but it's nothing we can do your miss carrying now you just have to let it take its course\nI'm terribly sorry about you have an experience that I Know you've heard this already the supervisor at the times says that's never what she said you the company has denied all of these allegations they've sent us a statement that said\nWe were sending to learn about Mr ... lost and twenty fourteen while we can't speak to what happened at this site before we bought it we've created a culture that is strongly grounded in dignity and respect or workplace in pregnancy a combination policies exceed what is legally required they also allege that\nThe Teamsters Union for whom you know work is is stirring up these stories to make the company look bad and I'm just curious what your reaction is to that when you hear that statements\nThey're lying because again that supervisor not only told me that but it was found real four or five women there was pregnant at the same time that I was pregnant it was like a trickle down effect I mean it in to try to put it on the Teamsters\n... no one was affiliated with a team says I now work for the team so to speak out but I wouldn't I wouldn't dare\nAllow anyone to downgrade the Teamsters because they are the ones that gave us a platform they gave the Boston is a voice so I feel like there's just very disrespectful to try to blame someone for their mistakes\nI Want to turn ... graves when you share a story like this when I read about her story in the New York times and about allegations of this kind of behavior going on in in in other warehouses [noise]\nThe thing that really struck me is that I thought surely this kind of treatment of a pregnant woman asking for lighter duty when she has a doctor's recommendation that that should be a legal requirements but it's not\nAnd I'm so grateful for ... and the other pregnant workers for speaking out because forty years after Congress first passed the pregnancy discrimination act you would think that this wouldn't be\nA problem what happened was a few years ago there is a Supreme Court decision that limited the interpretation that basically made it harder for pregnant workers when they need accommodations to get them\nAnd there has been a huge backlash to that decision we have had over Eighteen states have new laws to be more directive that sort of say actually\nSaid half new lives to be more direct in a sort of say actually pregnant workers shouldn't have to choose between having a healthy pregnancy and being able to stay on the job and get the income that they need which has some really terrible choice people are having to make right now\nSo does the law currently say what is protected under law and what is not\nPregnant workers should know that they cannot experienced discrimination on the chops I don't want to put out misinformation on that\nBut the real challenge is around when you need an accommodation not all pregnant workers are going to need that many people when I was pregnant at my job which is really 'cause she added that\nI didn't actually need an accommodation with my wife I sometimes you do and we hear from workers can be really basic things sometimes they just need that ... to go to the bathroom and they need to\nBe able to have water or working as a cashier being able to have a soft and they're not standing all day unfortunately what the Supreme Court sad is that an employer can make a determination that it isn't going to provide that accommodation if it's if it's an unnecessary brain for them\nThere seems to be a perverse incentive in the law which says that if you provide an accommodation for someone then you're required to provided for pregnant women or other women do ask for it it seems to be incentivizing people to provide no accommodation whatsoever\nAnd unfortunately a lot of employers have gotten more rich hadn't had made a working conditions if he says for everyone and so they say we treat everyone equally bad\nAnd that is our will and goodwill for anyone and you know the conditions that she described it to heat conditions that\nAt our it's with outbreaks all of those things that they should be really thick soon for all workers but certainly for workers to meet them\nOr I Fifteen ...

the Yellowstone Park rangers eager to share their nose and their story\nUm I had read a lot of wolf books in preparation for this I had never read one that was told from the perspective of a wolf um and so the idea was to write a sort of\nNon fiction book and read like a novel in which many of the main characters are wolves\nThe only way that was possible is because of this one was oh six was so famous during her lifetime um that she literally became one of the most famous wild animals in the world she was a wild animal yeah but she was carefully watched carefully observed what made it possible where they met a woman a really dedicated wolf watcher\nWho watched owes fixing her pack in Yellowstone every day or almost every day for three years and took note\nAnd she gave me this
