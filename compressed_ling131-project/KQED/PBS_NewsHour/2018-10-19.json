that we have hard\nEvidence now that they're interfering on all all sides of the issue all sides of the political spectrum I think that's a really important for Americans to know going in the

folks would turn out in front of the White House for a flash mob on July Fourth so these are on all sides of the political spectrum and this is exactly the tactic that Russia has the time and time

doesn't appear they'll ever be able to extradite her to the United states and faces charges\nMhm right it's it's extremely interesting to know that over three years they spend at least thirty five

mentioned you you mentioned that\nFlash mob people actually showed up for that I literally and and this isn't the first time we've seen activists show up to Russian organized or supported events like

telling me what you noted here is how much it says it's a special counsel and his office now know about this\nAbsolutely yeah yeah it's a staggering level of detail ah I don't know what that means for the future but I think it it it's an important issue for our our democracy heading into the midterms uh it's not a partisan issue and I would hope that politicians on on all sides of the aisle uh

lawmakers code sharing the Medicaid expansion campaign that people that need to have health care under the Affordable CARE Act the federal government pays at least Ninety percent of the cost of expansion\nPerry doesn't care that it's part of a law unpopular in Idaho she says it's a fiscally responsible way to provide needed insurance coverage\nThat doesn't have anything to do with the Affordable CARE Act and in the way that they like cat it their their rate relating to Obamacare\nI I think what it is Medicaid has been around since the Nineteen sixties I that is how we pay for

freedom foundation which opposes expansion she argues that would shift funding from the truly needy to what she describes as able bodied working age adults\nOne of the reasons it's been hard to repeal Obamacare is the states have been given this deal if you expand Medicaid the federal government will pick up Ninety percent of the cost of the state's ten\nSo states that have expanded the thirty three thirty four states that have expanded are hesitant to give up that deal and I think we're at a fork in the road if Idaho and Utah Montana Nebraska and other other states expand Medicaid it will be harder for Congress to reverse that\nBut those who face cancer and many other illnesses have a pre existing condition when it comes to health coverage\nNationwide Democrats are focusing on health

little the Republican candidate who was heavily favored his pledge to implement Medicaid expansion if it passes but hasn't said how he'll vote on the ballot initiative we met little who's campaigning on the streets blooming economy of Boise manufacturing plant where he serves on the board so\nWe have to address these people in the gap\nBut I I'm very committed to doing that\nThe question is do we just do the categorical Medicaid expansion of like the other states or do we do something else [noise]\nLittle argues that the the CIA is responsible for driving up insurance costs despite state

and you should ask tomorrow for their case to be dismissed here's the the bottom line\nTomorrow for their case if he gets now here's the the bottom line is it Senator McCaskill will not support any plans to cover people with preexisting conditions that isn't Obamacare\nObamacare was written to hold hostage people with preexisting conditions so that you have to have Obamacare supposedly to get this coverage and that's exactly what she's base this campaign on\nDavid ... healthcare their mama care of Affordable Care act\nWas working against Democrats now they're trying to use to their advantage do you think it's working\nI think a bit or you know if you ask Americans what ... do you care about health care comes up first or the economy slightly second guns and immigration so healthcare does seem to be the dominant issue\nA and it is a tradition of that one citizen titled meant wants to benefit from the federal program is Institute it becomes pretty sacred Medicare Social security\nRepublicans fight it for a little while and then they give him that's what the white Eisenhower basically did to the new deal\nUh and so I Do think it is working Democrat certainly think it is working because if you look at the ads that are buying a fifty five percent of the ads a correctional level and even at the gubernatorial level or the health care so they're making a that issue front and center\nI sort of think of just finally\nThat the norm says working I've been discussing that the what Trump is doing the culture of the political culture is actually more of an issue uh and more of a vulnerability and I wonder if Democrats would win over more swing voters if they focused on that because there are a lot of pretty conservative people who think what's happening to the country is pretty awful\nWhat about that mark and and what about the weather and healthcare is now working to Democrats advantage or not\nWhat I mean Democrats a past\nA portable CARE Act\nIt took a courage and the part of a a lot of Democrats who voted for who I knew there was staring into the political a bit and lost their seats in Congress and the result of it the leadership of Nancy Pelosi in particular deserves great credit\nBut it was unpopular it's been unpopular Donald Trump has made it popular and the Republicans have made it popular they came within one vote of repealing it Judy

I have a plan to it\nEighty years they've tried to pass\nThat it is limited national healthcare they finally did it\nIn in twenty ten and a ... you know the idea that we're going to magically doing and but for the one vote\nOn the late Senator John McCain it would've been repealed and we would not even be talking about pre existing conditions are Affordable Care act it any way today\nIt is some kind of turn around and see if it turns out that this is something that works to to help a top Democrats and David Martin brought up as a ... a a disappearance and everything I was a Saudi journalist\nUh we've been hearing about that now for several weeks I think just tonight as the Saudi Government is saying they're firing people are asking people to step down they're detaining\nOthers and all this we still don't have a clear picture of what the Trump Administration is going to do\nOr how do you see can the president walk a middle line here at the one on the one hand say yes it was a terrible thing but\nWe don't want to we don't want to ... in in a serious way change our relationship with a Saudi\nWell that's what's gonna happen in the middle east people understand you go through periods where people have to pretend to be mad at you and then they go back to normal affairs and I suspect that's what the Trump Administration is going to do with Saudi Arabia to me the prior problem is that whoever made the decision Saudi Arabia to do this didn't worry about Donald Trump didn't worry about America\nA and if the U.S withdraws it's normal role as the enforcer of some sort of international decency then people are putting the people like those in Saudi Arabia with people like those in North Korea or just instinctively and almost unconsciously think well I can get away with this\nUntil you get actions like that so it's almost a prior withdrawal of American power\nA and standards setting that seems to be at the core problem and then when you look at the Trump Administration reaction this happens every time they align themselves with a bad person whether it's gluten or this or or another so that person does something bad they try not to Iraq because they liked the bad person and then public opinion drags him into some grudging meaningless a acknowledgement and that sort of a pattern here\nTo have new stretching mark have to take a tough line or can they get away with trying to walk a middle ground here\nI I don't think there is a middle ground but I mean Michael Hayden the former CIA director under President Bush and and then at the president did a an NSA Director as well under President Obama remain um made it and I thought just a penetrating observation he said\nPresident Trump has close personal relations with three heads of state\nOr who have on their hands\nThe murder a of a citizen in ... in another country can John on\nA ... and and now the Saudi royal family and I mean I Know if you you're accused of mudslinging if you quote the president but I Do want to quote the president as some of his art and supporters say he shouldn't be quote it because he doesn't always mean he he said that in mice\nDid a an essay directors well under President Obama remain um made it and I thought just a penetrating observation he said President Trump has close personal relations with three heads of state\nOr who have on their hands\nThe murder a of a citizen in ... in another country a kitten John on a ...\nAnd and now the Saudi royal family and I mean I Know if you choose to much swinging if you quote the president but I Do want to quote the president as some of his supporters say he shouldn't be quote it because he doesn't always mean\nHe he said that am I supposed to dislike them the speaking of Saudis I liked it very much they make me which they make new unions and hundreds of millions I make ... make them a lot of money with them\nUm and this is a this is about his his dad use it in these in the United states that use I mean ... that's what he's in body that's what he represents and I I just think it's it is absolutely terrifying for the for the United states foreign policy and ... and who we are\nAnd what we believe in the world\nThat does it have long lasting consequences David\nBut we'll see I guess this is why I'm a little mystified that the Democrats are not going after this issue more why they're going after healthcare and other policy issues to me this is the big issue of the election\nThat it is frankly if if Donald if the Republicans keep the house and Senate that Donald Trump will feel unleash still feel that this style of politics the style of foreign policy this definition of our moral order is been totally vindicated by the American people\nAnd so to me that's the core issue or how do we see ourselves as country what kind of the country do we say are we strictly a money country we've sometimes looked like that to outsiders I don't think that's true but that is pretty much the east coast that Trump is embodying in a quite an embarrassed what\nMark a voice I can can Democrats and do something when they haven't found Democrats do something well then we'll we'll\nDemocrats
