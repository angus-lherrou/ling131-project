Harris skill question has thrown is of the latest FBI investigation\nThis was not a search for the truth this was not an investigation this was an abdication of responsibility and duty\nIf confirmed tomorrow will have enough food joined the other eight\nJustices on the Supreme Court early next week and Lisa joins me now along with news our White House correspondent\nYummy ... I'll send or hello to both of you Lisa as we said what a dramatic day tell us a little bit more about what it was like when did the yes voters decide and what factors went into the decision\nA dramatic after such a dramatic week Judy going into this vote I spoke to several Republican leaders including wavelength\nWho is a good vote count are they did not know if they had the votes going in the last time that happened on health care they lost it was a big gamble but in the end as you sat in that chamber I saw Lisa Murkowski with her head down looking at our hands I Susan Collins next to her\nThe two weren't steak and they weren't called to each other but it seemed that we're probably going to go in different ways so when Murkowski announced that no vote\nIt really sent shockwaves through the chamber is he in trouble and then caught we've new college or the mansion with a yes\nAnother surprise vote I if it was quite a dramatic day and I think those yes votes were very important to look out Collins talked a lot about the homework she did she went into a lot of substance\nBut when you talk about to mansion and talking to his team he was really struck by his personal time with judge Kavanaugh and he and he felt the judge have not convinced him that he would consider human beings and his decision essentially mansions was trusting having all based on their personal interaction [noise]\nWow so so yeah I mean ... ah you've been at the White House talking to them to take us behind the scenes what are they saying where they wringing their hands all day long what was going on there\nWell the White House offered this nomination and one President Trump watched very closely with all this drama played out on the hill Don McGahn White House counsel personally when the hill to shepherd the boat threw\n'em in the White House that was very very involved in Brett Kavanaugh's nomination the president himself with calling senators engaging senators throughout the week but overall today\nAnd the White House really was making the case look this is Brett Kavanaugh's chance he's going to be a good conservative judge you should trust him and I should say that that the White House really coach Brett Kavanaugh for hours and hours and hours first of about his initial testimony and then when he had to go back a second time and they hold Brett Kavanaugh you should be aggressive and and your defense of yourself\nVan Dyke was originally charged with first degree murder the jury convicted him on second degree murder as I understand that suggested they\nBelieved he didn't believe that his wife was an endangered but that that belief was unreasonable I Know you've heard some of the jurors talk about the verdict what they said their decision turned on\nWell they say a number of things so I'm One of them was the option to convict on second degree murder instead of first degree murder the jurors say they felt that Jason Van Dyke actually felt that he was in danger that he had the officers around him faith in imminent risk and that that is what he acted on it that's why they didn't convict on first degree murder second degree instead\nThey say it was banned dykes own testimony they didn't think that he was very credible they say that he had a hard time recalling what happened the night of the incident a and that what he said a lot of it didn't match what they saw in the video specifically when Van Dyke you just heard testified that\nHe saw the corn McDonald from his perspective raise that knife in his direction they say the video does not bear that out and then there is a video they say they watched it obviously many times in the courtroom\nBut they also watched it a lot in their own deliberation and that had a good deal to do with that they also felt that a Van Dyke being an officer of almost Twenty years that he should have been able to de escalate the situation rather than opening fire\nIn so much was made in leading up to the uh the trial about the makeup of the jury what was the racial makeup of the jury\nSo the jury a lot of people say that it was not very diverse or I Can't recall exactly the breakdown men and women as well as racial diversity but\nThe case was me out to be a lot about race and there was only one a African American a juror and we did hear from her this afternoon as well but when we heard from those jurors one of them said you know race came up very little in their deliberations for them that was not about race in fact one of them said we were here for ... a lot\nHas happened or this or is that a big effect on the city of Chicago police commissioner lost his job ah the states which are the prosecuting attorney for the county was it was voted out if there's some sense that this was a turning point\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political

is running to replace him so that will be\nAnother change but the police accountability task force that was appointed shortly after the video was released it was one of many in a succession and for some people I think are also a maybe a bit jaded and thinking that um that this is going to be a turning point that turning point could have been when the video was released because I just got a lot has happened since then\nUh the city has finally come to an agreement on a consent decree with the state's attorney general\nUh so I think there is some hope but obviously the city's history of distrust between the community and the police department it's generations old and so it's probably going to take a lot more than a dozen verdict to\nImplement lots of heavy change brand of treatment

weird to me too movement stand how far had it come since those revelations of a year ago\nAh the reaction from judge Kavanaugh was there any way to have a real legitimate conversation about this charge against him and how they dealt\nWith well you can just said this is an alternative universe but there's a universe somewhere out there and the cosmos or where people say okay we have this charge\nTo cheese making destroyed this very compelling story she's telling this very ... stories telling\nWhat is the what is the the record of memory in these cases how well do people remember thirty six years ago how well do people who've been traumatized by something remember that and just go through informational you how to evaluate this this evidence what's the record with other cases like that\nOr go back into his past instead we got Michael Evan Eddie and these people saying oh he's been in gang rapes now we had which was I think it's crucial turning wasn't really rallying Republicans\nAre and so it just became immediately everybody decide and then if you agree that there was some uncertainty about the core issue what happened to that party thirty six years ago people then decided well he was really a big drinker he threw ice at other people while in college\nThey arrived at post talk rationalizations for their previous ideological positions by some other means and that happens on both left and right and so basically I think I just look at where everybody came down\nAnd in a rational world we look the story was not an ideological story it was two people telling different stories was not about capitalism is not about immigration was amount of an abortion and the things we really disagree about was to human beings\nAnd what I saw was the polarization of to human beings for ideological reasons or and so in an actual case you would sit down we'll\nSo there's this person this person that's ... the deal with it on a personal level that\nMark was was Christian ... Ford was her ... she and her story just basically knew from the START I mean the message is if you have a story like this if you have something that you you believe is true forget it I mean\nWell I mean uh I Hope not I mean I I think she has which has going far is that she made the case long before he was nominated\nA she didn't she didn't join in some parade she didn't come out to she was obviously reluctant or to to do so um she she had had registered her own a belief conviction\nA memory or this is not uncommon a that a person who is a victim I remember vividly the after shave lotion one by the attacker and can't tell you the address that is not that is not uncommon Connie Chung had a rather persuasive piece on that ... of her own experience with a family physician\nI'm at the same at the same time there there's no question David right they they went to their\nTheir camps um I I Do think there was a sort of a hassle response on the part of a Republican senators who said oh she's so convincing she's close compelling she's so believable something happened but she just has to be wrong about it happening with him I mean that I just found that off putting an end patronize\nI agree with that the one thing the polling a seemed to suggest that people believe her they were uncomfortable\n... more or less convicting without some corroborating evidence and so you got sixty percent of the American people say if another witness says yes I remember that or if there's some physical evidence yes and but without that a lot of people who felt just felt uncomfortable really changing the trajectory of a man's life over this without that currently writing\nAnd I just I just had one thing Judy and how how important the court is it's only Eighteen years ago that the Supreme Court resolved Bush they'd go that was a case where a nice for the United states had won the popular vote and the court shows\nThat his Republican challenger and so when I buy a five to four vote inactive enormous statesmen shift and generosity of spirit Al Gore accepted it and called upon his supporters to accept it\nI don't know given today's climate David described it if a court decision would be accepted without fighting in the streets and I will say to this the support is the ... the critics of a judge Kavanaugh\nUm who are holding basically rallies in the Capitol today and tomorrow only hurting their cause they aren't helping anything um they're not they're not sure I mean there there are purposes of protest this time for protests and there's an intriguing is over\nAt the end and meanwhile David near herring you're being told that it's been a backlash that it's the what you mentioned and then again it's the pro Kavanaugh or that he that he has ... of a powerful force in his day half that's going to be out there for\nHalf of Republican advisor or last week you know over the last couple of weeks on Trump's approval ratings kind of like eight points\nAnd others are in the red states which is where a lot of these Senate races are there's a strong tied you pay a little real political price if you're against Kavanaugh right now Heidi Heitkamp pay the is probably going to pay is very serious prize for the for this and\nShe took so the the political window at least in the red states was um it's pretty strong right now and Republican fortunes Democrats as we said last week were super engaged have always been engaged now Republicans Wrigley engaged and so the enthusiasm advantage is down though is our colleague Amy Walter a road um today\nKavanaugh support tracks Trump support\nIf you elect Trump's cabinet all it's it's like it's just the tribal thing uh and so it's not about the individual\nDisagree a hundred ... a one point David make I I I Do think Judy in the final analysis mid term election it's a referendum on the president United States and and it will be an up or down vote on ...\nAnd it was a referendum on the president United States and and it will be an up or down vote on on Donald Trump\nAnd and make no mistake about it um women in this election or are at ... women who did not go to college\nWorking women are now ... the Democrat you have women white women voting democratic uh and that is it that said no that's a new development in this country and that's that's a ... yes it is it just it's a change\nI'm In college and before that without without a college in ... group that Donald Trump carried by twenty seven points I don't think this and this this will be a factor in the election I I don't think by any means it's resolved on which side comes out\nWell the last we're probably only a little more than a minute but my last question was going to be how do we heal from this but it doesn't sound like there's a whole lot of healing\nYeah I think a lot of people you know in the valley is a value vision is the first to say um and so when you see how far we've gone a lot of people emailed me and said you know how do we learn how to persuade each other again and so you know people do ... people are not stupid they they react to a bad thing\nI I I Hope I Hope David right I Hope I'm I I don't I don't think we have a leader ah who wants to heal I mean we have three point seven percent unemployment in the country\nAnd and yet we're still talking about right Michelle in or other corners and and writing people often to stay in Philly um I think it has to it has to begin at the bottom 'cause it's not beginning at the top\nWords to remember will remember them mark shields David Ross thank you both thank you
