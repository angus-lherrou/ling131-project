composition in a state with an independence streak about a\nA while back you know elected a third party governor and former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura\nAnd uh and I I Do want to ask you about issues there as well but I Want to get to Scott Shafer in California where you've also got some very interesting congressional races underway water voters talking about their Scott\nWell first of all Judy there was a real sense of dysfunction in Washington they're tired of the bickering or they feel that the government isn't paying attention to their problems that they want that fixed they want the parties to work together to get things done\nHealthcare is definitely a big issue there are concerns about the Republican tax bill and places like Orange County where many of these competitive races are being held or the tax bill could will hurt people in places like that were home costs are very high incomes are high\nAnd ah but certainly the Democrats are talking a lot about that there's also a repeal of the gas tax on the statewide ballot here\nA at a force Orange County which is again where many of these races are playing out very anti tax historically and so Republicans are hoping to use that issue along with the immigration a security at the border to get voters to come out to the polls\nAre but I Will say that in terms of fundraising Democrats in the last quarter the third quarter of outrage and he's competitive races Republicans by five to one and these are all first time candidates you to all these Democrats they've never run for office before and they're doing really well both\nRaising money and in the polls where polls show that almost all the seats are very very competitive right now in some cases around the crowd at least one case the Democrats' way ahead\nAnd and brown of a nosy you a minute ago where they were talking about issues on them\nOn the minds of voters you started with healthcare but President Trump is coming up as well uh we know that in a couple of these races where you have a Republican incumbent in in one case with Leonard Lance if someone who hasn't always voted with the president but there there's another race where you have a candidate\nWho has been a Tom MacArthur who's been more ... more\nPro Donald Trump\nWho's been more ... more pro Donald Trump\nIt's been interesting to see which candidates and depending upon their district lean more toward a advocating for the president's policy that message from Democrats had then we will be the checks and balances on President Trump's hard right agenda\nOn the message from Republicans who know that they have a base as is in the case of the third district with Tom MacArthur is\nI Will stand up for the president's policies for the reasons that you'll elected hand\nAnd in that case it still seems to be working up and the eleventh district uh we've been noticing that\nPresident Trump name is often left out a specifically in discussions and in the seventh as you mentioned Judy were actually gearing up to host a debate tonight between Leonard Lance and Tom ... were both candidates are saying hey I'm a moderate on pragmatic on a sensible centrist\nI'm going to talk to those undecided voters that we have quite a few of us\nIn this a suburban area this very a district that particular one where you have really a highly educated voters who also tend to disapprove of the president's job a job\nYou know so much of it depends on the profile of the district of course and who these voters are and what what they think is in their interest in Maryland Hamer quickly uh Minnesota is how much of a factor as President Trump there in these close races house races\nTrump is a big factor and in fact she has visited he was just in southern Minnesota down in Minnesota's open congressional district she was visiting the Rochester area and there Jim ... during the Republican is running with it and he loves the president and up in the eighth Pete Stauber the Republican they're also running with the president appearing with the president\nThe interesting part is approval numbers are different in those two regions in northern Minnesota is known as the iron range steel tariffs appear to be fairly popular there the governor's rating the president's ratings are holding their\nButt in southern Minnesota soybean territory soybean farmers there appear to be pretty displeased\nWith the soybean tariffs so the president appears to be helping Republicans in northern Minnesota but potentially hurting Republicans in souther Minnesota and then we had those two suburban seats\nOne of the Republicans is running with the president the other is not congressman Eric pulse and in the suburbs not running with the president and then Congressman Jason Lewis said yeah I like what are you doing maybe don't always like style\nBut he says his policies are working so it really depends on where you are in Minnesota\nSo interesting to get this picture of the whole country finally quickly let me come back to you Scott Shafer on we know the president I have played a different role in California he uh is not as popular isn't in some other parts of the country but there are parts of your state where he is\nAbsolutely Donald Trump won twenty eight or so of California's fifty three counties it's just that you know a lot of people don't live there\nBut in these in these competitive races these districts were talking about Donald Trump is not particularly popular a and the Kennedy's the Republicans are not mentioning him a President Trump is not coming out here to campaign or raise money\nHe's going to Nevada next door Arizona but not to California think they've decided that it was not helpful to help him out your you'll always turn up the uh the Democratic vote more so are we seeing Obama and Biden out you're campaigning for Democrats but so far Mike Pence was there a while ago but no President Trump\nFascinating well we still have almost three weeks ago and we're going to be watching all of these house races between now and then and certainly on election night\nScott Shafer ... uh in California brown of a nosy with New Jersey a TV news n J TV and New Jersey ... hammer Twin Cities in Minnesota thank you\nThank you [noise]\nAs we reported earlier journalist Jamal ... disappearance is leading to an array of difficult questions for the president and about the United states' political relationship with Saudi Arabia\nMany U.S companies have long had business ties with the Saudis and as William bringing explains those corporations now have to answer their own questions about whether they will continue to conduct business as usual with the kingdom\nThere is a big investment conference in Saudi Arabia next week it's been dubbed the Davos in the desert conference and initially a number of prominent us executives planning to attend\nBut then ... to show you disappeared and the Saudis claim no knowledge of what happened to him\nNow a number of those executives have pulled out they include J. P. Morgan CEO Jimmy diamond Ford Motor German bill Ford and over CEO Daraa costs for shocking but a number of business leaders will still attend the big event and so we'll U.S Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin\nToday when President Trump was again after both to show he emphasized America's economic ties with Saudi Arabia\nThere are tremendous purchaser\nOf not only military equipment but other than what I was there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten billion dollars worth the village are those are the biggest orders of the history of this country probably the history of the world I don't think there's ever been in order for\nFour hundred and fifty billion dollars you remember that day in Saudi Arabia where the commitment was made\nTo help go a little deeper into those economic ties into corporations are responding to this crisis\nI'm joined now by Andrew Ross Sorkin he's an editor and columnist for the New York times and also the co host of CNBC ... box\nHe himself was scheduled to go to the Saudi Arabia conference but recently pulled out I mean I drove thank you very much for being here I Know you've been reporting a great deal about these decisions made by CEOs to pull out can you just\nThese decisions made by CEOs to pull out or can you just tell me what was their calculus well it turned out to be\nA remarkable crucible a for business executives in the United states and really around the world um in terms of not only going to Riyadh next week but\nWhat's going to Riyadh would represent an endorsement if you will of the kingdom in so many of these executives whether it's J. P. Morgan or Blackstone or black rock or rubber\nHave real business interests in Saudi Arabia so there is something meaningful for all of them at risk\nI'm real money real profits 'em and real questions about their ability in the future to be able to continue to do business in some of these are in Saudi Arabia J. P. Morgan for example has done business in that country since Nineteen thirty and\nThis is a country that has historically held grudges\nWas it your sense that this was a principal decision on their part it was just terrible objects and if there'll be right back in business with Saudi Arabia the minute the storm passes\nYou know it's a very complicated question it's it's it's a similarly complicated question or for those in Washington right now clearly the optics\nI'm In the very immediate term wait on them the phone calls from journalists like myself and others asking are you going to we're supporting around that but not just from this side of the aisle for their employees their customers were calling them saying do you really going to go to an event\nSponsored by the crown prince in the midst of these headlines they murdered journalist\nAnd so I think that has waited on hold them um by default um I I like to think of some of them do have a principled stand on this um but I think they're also wrestling with the long term economics an economic ties to this country and what that means for their businesses\nAnd as you report in a recent column you did in the New York times it's not like Saudi Arabia is the only country that American businesses do business with that have a troubled human rights ... and that's the that's\nA but these men and women are you know to lose your whole livelihood and the whole future or in and especially if they don't actually get treated a further ...\nAnd Brian Ross quickly on the time we have left are not only the people who are already in the spotlight but the record number of veterans candidates ah this year do you think that could help\nAbsolutely you know anytime you're bringing awareness to this issues which is what you're doing right now which is what's been going on in Congress and other places whether it's the look at the suicide rates out there or the way that we can help our veterans coming home to to find work to reintegrate into society to make sure that they have healthy relationships with their families\nThere is a very active effort not just of the governmental fraud at the nonprofit fraud at the community level fraud to make sure that this occurs people care about our veterans today\nIn a way that is so very very obvious it makes a difference in the life of every veteran and made a difference in my life I think I can speak for room and it's made a difference in his life as well this is something that's important and we should all be proud about today\n[noise] Brian Ross Republican from Florida room and guy or do Democrats from Arizona thank you very much to both thank you [laughter]\n\n\nNow let's turn to immigration and the president's approach to it which is once again stirring up concern is a mid term elections approach us border patrol agents arrested more than sixteen thousand family members in September according to a new report from the Washington Post\nThat is a record high since President Trump officially ended a policy of separating families at the border the relative spike in border crossings come as the administration ways new steps to discouraging deter or cross border flow\nIncluding what some are calling family separation two point oh\nWith the latest on what we know I'm joined by on the boss on that he'd been following all this so since the president did announce officially in July of this policy was ending we know the administration has been working what would the ACLU other groups to try to\nTake care of these children but do we know having done that do we know how many are still in custody\nLast unless you to go for sure and I remember even before the president order at the end of family separation it took a federal judge coming in and saying you have to stop it and you have to reunite these families that was June twenty six\nSixteen weeks and they're still children and US government can custody\nThey're trying to reunite how many well the government that number say there are sixty six kids in their care today that they are currently working to reunite one under the age of five as well we should point out why are they telling people for the vast majority of them fifty of those children their parents were already deported\nAnd that presents a huge particle challenged first you have to find the parents\nThen you have to contact them then you have to ask if they want their children sent back to the same country they were fleeing the government the ACLU or working through that right now but it's also disturbing to point out the ACLU says there are still five children whose parents they have been unable to contact for talking about five kids who could be permanently orphaned as a result of U.S policy\nSo twenty five hundred or so\nOriginally they're down to sixty six clearly there's been some a lot of progress but they still have work to do\nThey do and it's important to point out look sixty six kids they say they're still working to reunite\nOur review of the numbers show there's another two hundred and fifty children still in government care who they are not working to reunite for a number of reasons and those reasons race some more questions these are cases in which they were separated from someone other than the parents say a grandparent or an older sibling\nCases in which the government says the parent is unfit to be reunited but they will provide a lot of details are cases in which the parent was deported\nAnd then the government said well look the parents we contacted them and they said they don't want the child\nBrought back to the same country in which I did they were fleeing the conditions in the first place\nUm we should also see immigration advocates on the front lines they're worried the government's under reporting some of the separated family numbers are facing down on what they've heard and seen on the front lines and the government's own watchdog agency homeland security's watchdog agency last month\nIssued a pretty damning report slamming the government for the inconsistency in numbers and the lack of transparency that than what they were giving their own investigators\nAnd there is confusion because as you said the sixty six but then as you said they're still others who are ill in government and it is the only government so the president was asked about all this yesterday he did an interview with the Associated Press he seemed to say that most of these children who would\nCome across the border had either come alone or they were with smugglers and he went on to say that this family separation policy was meant to be a deterrent what does the evidence show has\nIt been so the president's absolutely right that the government right now has thousands of migrant children and they're carrying capacity and that the vast majority of them arrived alone as kids tend to be older they tend to have been sent away from economic uncertainty or violent\nThey tend to arrive kind of knowing what to expect to have contact information family members they know they'll go into a shelter\nAnd then be reunited the president's wrong though to indicate that the majority of the children that they separated under zero tolerance that the majority of them came with smugglers traffickers that's just not true and the government's own numbers there that out the president's also wrong in his apparent belief that family separation worked at it as a deterrent\nGood to be a deterrent what is the evidence show has it been so the president absolutely right that the government right now has thousands of migrant children and they're carrying capacity and that the vast majority of them arrived alone those kids tend to be older they tend to have been sent away from economic uncertainty or violence\nThey tend to arrive kind of knowing what to expect to have contact information of family members they know they'll go into a shelter\nAnd then be reunited the president's wrong though to indicate that the majority of the children that they separated under zero tolerance that the majority of them came with smugglers traffickers that's just not true and the government's own numbers there that out\nThe president's also wrong and it's apparent belief that family separation worked at us as a deterrent the numbers don't show that as you talked about earlier the latest border crossings\nActually show a short tourists bike and I say short term because important to remember and all of this is that historically border crossings are at a low if you take a look at a graph like this that goes back to two thousand over the last Twenty years or so look Twenty years ago border crossings month by month around Seventy eighty sometimes two hundred thousand a month\nSo today Fifteen sixteen thousand sounds like a lot but it's still a historic low now finally\nAnd just quickly where we are starting to hear about another policy the administration is considering we called it may be a two point oh what what do we know about\nIt last week there was a report the government's consider including a choice before parents when they crossed the border\nAnd basically saying look you can either keep your child with you and federal detention which is not designed to house children waved their protection under our child welfare law or willingly be separated let your child be taken from you and go into a government shelter that's designed for children\nNow I asked the adjusts official about this list pulls look we're going to uh do whatever we need to do to humanely enforce the law to secure our borders and that there'll be looking at a range of options we should point out\nThis is a policy they actually floated back in July they put it before the judge who was overseeing or even at the ... the government feels like they've got a judge to sign off if they need to use it\nThey will um we should also say immigration advocates say if they decide to put it in place there's going to be a flurry of litigation similar to what we saw after the original family separation policy now so much to keep track of them really important to continue to follow this on ... thank you Judy\n[noise]\nDoctor shortages around the country affect access to care for millions of Americans is estimated by twenty twenty five there will
