that New York hot to host the Olympics and a eventually that that idea became a bit of a movement or it drew the attention of Mike Bloomberg with the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh\nI don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less beam their\nWhich as you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump Rand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well voters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal smart self made fiercely pragmatic\nAnd he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterated in the September eleventh terrorist attack less than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred an eighth mayor\nBloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other news sites to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven or he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDamn doctor off do that job for six years\nHe then asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nBloomberg was finally done being mayor into thousands Thirteen after squeezing out a third term spite preexisting two term limit he considered running for president you considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and do all you know it's a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't want to go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today as CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nOkay let's back up to before the un doctor off was a new one [noise]\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because you thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you got delayed the one that would be to assassinate had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursued you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee bill\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of be off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will\nOr financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past as to how they use the deadlines of the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite a science of what kind of reasonable benefit from it all\nDepends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive reads owning a gun in time it cetera et cetera\nNow the second question you asked was or we'd better off having now one and there I think the answer is no because I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more\nBecause I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more stuff done for\n... subway today if we continent well right now\nThere's a red flag warning for parts of the north bay today gusty winds hot weather low humidity high temperatures today around the bay in the seventies and eighties in St overnight lows will be in the fifties [noise]\n\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDamn doctor off started his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York then joined the Bloomberg administration to help New York recover from the nine eleven attack who then haired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York\nThat exists today one of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr Ross is chairman of president [noise]\nShed I'm just curious about the the wide and southern white in\nNew York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts beamed at least [laughter]\n[noise] yeah well the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea and the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this area on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided that the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution we said to\nSponsorship of the cake the live stream by as a Gen presenting miss Saigon a new production of the legendary musical from the creators of Les Miserables October night through November fourth ... Chen or freedom theater at ... dot com\nTo when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this\nArea on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for one it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York um the leading edge culturally in the world and so we\nEventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem that led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible program adequately a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be re configured like a transformer or something yes\nIt's exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the building was literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather to shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized the real operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental ism of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of the big city like New York\nThat's a great way of saying you know another way of expressing as say cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline and may look our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's going to happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends begin to change I think that is a very different notion of the cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors the high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and\nYou are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me that\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble in the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration of immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be\nA beautiful park and a manatee I Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because the government is really hard um and just getting anything done often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that what we're competitive entity in New York and whether we are competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave that using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some\nTitian has on each area because you know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system\nAnd basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivized firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives or to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy it was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been the bride companies to stay or bribe companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user and so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world you know it was sort of this optimistic sense that produces incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that most places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became [noise]\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know you know how hard it is to change your own personality it's hard to change the city's personality but that doesn't mean you can't you know structure around your strengths and structure around your weaknesses\n[noise]\nReveal is coming up next it starts at four set the alarm and the ... and you can wake up to MORNING EDITION start your day with the latest from NPR and cake you eat the news stories that matter I mean who's inform and to inspire download ... today on your iPhone and Android devices\n[noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\n[noise] I'm sure you've been hearing the ever more anguished calls to regulate the huge tech firms known collectively as gas Google Amazon Facebook and\nThese companies in super large platform monopolistic\nThey have developed the capacity to manipulate us to control us to control the information that is delivered to us control the pricing which products are delivered to us to control us as producers [noise]\nThe gas companies are far bigger richer and arguably more dominant\nThan tech companies in the past Google for instance has Ninety percent of global search engine market share Facebook is more than ... billion monthly active users Amazon has an estimated Ninety five million prime members in the U. S. that something like Seventy five percent of all American households\nIt's estimated almost fifty percent of all online spending goes to Amazon\nThis kind of scale creates a lot of concern we've examined this concern in previous episodes like who runs the Internet and is the Internet being ruined\nWe're seeing the person you censor of power real power we depend on these technologies that have been in many ways wonderful and fascinating by making significant decisions laterally\nThere's also the question of whether the mission of these firms is as socially beneficial as many people believed they were in the early days Internet there's old is\nReally smart engineers there the brightest computer scientists and oh they're thinking about is how do I keep someone on Facebook for ten more minutes left the exact combination of things that will keep them stay on the site as long as possible so that we can show them as much advertising that's\nPossible so here's a question if you are one of those huge dominant super wealthy firms what would you do to ensure that the good times state that\nYou probably spend a lot of money lobbying politicians which yeah they do it's been a huge ramping up lately lobbying by ... [noise] but you might\nAlso do something a bit subtler\nStory today begins with a journalist\nI'm Franklin for a writer with the Atlantic\nYou are one of three brothers who write books are talking about that for just a minute and the family that produced all of you\nRight so I have two brothers Johnathan he's written a good number of novels including everything is limited and I got a younger brother named Josh who is a science writer who wrote a book called mood walking\nWith Weinstein and it's actually incredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because ah I'm sure it in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being three brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her\nOwn accomplishments right but I you know\nDidn't do anything they didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day or or sit down and study the great chef masters [laughter] we watched a lot of heat man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut one of the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to stand essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card at will at the book shop\nAnd so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in journalism was at slate one of the very first mainstream online publications would just start by Microsoft and so there was a huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes\nThere was a certain amount of utopian isn't associated with the emergence of the Internet this idea that we were gonna tied the world together\nI Love search engines I Love the fact that I can access every book in human history in a nanosecond I Love that I can get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things arguably make life much better and maybe in arguably make life\nMuch better so these technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle is an incredible invention in the ... and yeah and I found were incredible innovation and so I think we were right to marvel at them\nSo after rating for sleep for a while you moved on to the New Republic a as you call it the intellectual Oregon for hard nosed liberalism you ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nThe New Republic with this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an ...\nThat always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist\nOregon and managed to persist over a hundred years well never really turning a profit and so\nAs we entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing to continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next and I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up\nResigning his editor but then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard and co founder of Facebook\nAnd he bought the magazine and to me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media\nWho had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back and I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd their relationship in the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nYeah we became really good friends and it was exhilarating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and that maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris decided that he always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn\nAround our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we start chasing cliques in two thousand thirty in the ... way to get ... was to post to clip from last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and you slap the headline on it and you may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine then if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school just suddenly find yourself producing things that are extremely popular you become obsessed with replicating\nThat popularity in ... in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to master social media and this new environment\nBut we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you were about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job and was offering other people jobs at the New Republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to replicate it over and over again\nYeah that's completely right I felt like it in retrospect I realized that I was just living this compressed version of recent history\n[noise] the reason the history of the Internet at least over the years Franklin for his view of the Internet it shifted the same guy who used to think this\nThere was a certain amount of utopian ism associated with the emergence of the Internet and this I Love search engines and this the technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company has now come\nTo think this Amazon thinks of itself as the everything store and it's gotten itself in a pretty much every conceivable business it owns whole foods it powers the cloud or it has this data\nFor the CIA and so on and so on and there's really nothing that it doesn't try to squeeze into its empire he also thinks this at Facebook\nShapes the way that we consume news as Google shapes the way that we interact with information and there's Amazon has shaped the way
