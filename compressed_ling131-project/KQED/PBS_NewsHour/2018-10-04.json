for ...\nConfirming Kavanaugh Russia mounted on others supporters of Kavanaugh's showed up at the office of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski remains undecided\nAnd Lisa joins me now along with White House correspondent ... or so Lisa what do we know about this report what or senator saying and is it changing any votes\nWe own a supplemental report itself with something like fifty pages or so and it included interviews with at least nine people and apparently the FBI reached out to at least attempt person who may not have spoken to them\nUm senators are not supposed to speak about it but I Know send our kind of doing it the whole Kavanaugh file is now about should I care about this thing and he said\nAnd what happened in my nose closed doors her syndrome can reference this senators had to split up the supplemental interviews and pass them around one by one at one point they were had staff reading out loud the entire supplemental report\nI think in the end though I did not share any senator indicate that what they found in today's report if something substantially knew that is good news for Republicans who support Mr Kavanaugh but of course Democrats are complaining that this report with stacked in that\nDirection from the gecko that's they're feeling so you ... what are they saying that the White House what's the state of play there\nThe White House and President Trump are very happy and they want this to happen quickly the fact that there was no new information seemingly innocence in this FBI investigation is not only good news for Republicans at least it's and it's good news for the White House who were the little worry about what they could fight in the air is Sanders today gave us a very vigorous defense of Brett Kavanaugh\nShe said that he's given more than any other nominee include it in and she was referring to his interview the documents that he handed over you should ... we're we're she's also referring to the testimony that gave\nAnd really what you're saying there is that enough is enough\nBrett Kavanaugh needs to get a vote everyone should be able to just have an opinion right now\nI'm I was at the White House today when the president walked by our our reporters screaming and and and really asking all these different questions I myself I wanted to ask them about mocking Dr Ford and whether or not he feels like he has the votes to confirm his nominee you didn't say anything to us but he did tweet as the president often dead and when he said was\nThis is a very important time in our country due process fairness and common sense are now on trial so that's the White House's take\nSo so you may she's also been talking to the other side what our critics a of a Brett Kavanaugh and and defenders of of course named lousy for her legal team what are they saying\nThe number one complaint is that the the FBI should have done more they should have talked to more people they should have had more time to conduct an investigation\nEveryone thinks that the White House or at least in the critics of the things that the White House somehow limited the FBI I'm told them that you can only speak to the people I don't think that Dr Ford and don't speak to Brett Kavanaugh the White House of course vigorously denies that\nI'm an doctor Ford's legal team put out a four page letter jade I usually have been giving statements with a couple of paragraphs but this is four pages and what they really are saying and here is that there are number of people that the FBI should've talked to they said that the FBI should've talked to the polygraph\nGraphic examiner's talking and and really had him explain what the results of that polygraph where they say that the past\nThat they they'll play the FBI should've talked to Dr Ford has been they said that they should have talked to Dr Ford's friends that she told about the idea that she had been sexually assaulted long before Brett Kavanaugh was the nominee so that's really what people are saying that that that the White House did this on purpose but the way up and again I say we did not limited as we did not micromanage the\nFinalists that were out of the votes what does it look like in the center\nYou know all of these segments we've done what Brett Kavanaugh has ruled in the past his past hearing all that comes down to tomorrow now Judy the Senate has scheduled the key vote which is a procedural vote cloture for ten thirty tomorrow morning\nAnd uh first of all we know that Democrats got to know about that they wanted to date from Heidi Heitkamp and I want to point out why she voted no significant because she was a yes vote on justice Gorsuch she said today I voted for justice Gorsuch because I felt his legal ability and temperament qualify tend to serve on the Supreme Court judge Kavanaugh is different\nThen she went on to talk about the story of a sexual assault that people have told her in the last week and she wrote our actions right now are pointing signal to the young girls and women across our country she is running for her life in North Dakota to keep her job and she has voted no that's significant\nAlso the senators now to watch the she is a no vote there's four senators to watch how they vote in the next day of course Maine Senator Susan Collins\nJeff Flake of Arizona Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jeff Flake wasn't yes at one point um he's never indicate otherwise now Joe mansion one of the last senator to read the report today I'm told he will return tomorrow morning to look at it again\nAnd as interviews with those individuals perhaps lead to other individuals who are identified they will the agents will go an interview them it's uncommon in my experience\nFor the White House to micromanage that process the overall a way in which the White House typically manages the process is they provide a deadline for the bureau to complete its work\nAnd you and you're saying because that means the FBI can then go and do whatever it deems it thinks is necessary to get to to get a thorough investigation down\nThat's generally the goal for the bureau is to to do\nA thorough investigation as possible again for the benefit of the White House so as to allow the White House and the president to have as much information as possible before publicly announcing a nomination here of course\nUh the new allegations emerged after the public announcement and in fact after the first hearing and so it made this a very different process\n[noise] a very different process Gregory Brower thank you very much for joining us we appreciate it thank you [noise]\nAnd now now how all this looks on Capitol Hill Republican Senator Mike rounds of South Dakota\nHas read the FBI report he read it earlier today and he joins us now senator what did you make of of the FBI report you perhaps have just heard from this former agent we've spoken with and we're also hearing from Democrats who are criticizing limits placed on the edge\nOf her first of all there were no new items there was no shock or any place there was\nLots more detail for us to listen to us regard to the to the explanations made by individuals but nothing that shock to anybody known to revelations rocked confirmation of what had already been said or or discussed within the public's review during the\nDuring the the hearing that came up\nA basically a confirmed what we've already heard [noise]\nUm but they did go through the process with a number of different witnesses who basically shows no collaboration with any of the allegations that that had that had been made to begin with and and basically there was nothing new there that we had basically heard about that had relevancy to the to the issues at hand\nHe weren't bother to take place limits on the people that can talk to him\nBut I I think the question that have been raised was\nWhy weren't we having the judge and also a professor Ford once again review remember that in this case as in all cases the FBI will do an investigation with the three oh two which is\nBasic information asking about issues and and the uh the the accusations specific\nThem both a professor Ford and a judge Kavanaugh I went through literally hours and hours of testimony in front of the individuals who are the decision makers which are the Judiciary Committee and for all of us who listen to that testimony which we not only will listen to one so back to an review again and\nI suspect that what happened is they said look he's already gone through and we've had a chance to ask questions and doubled down with regard to the questions and concerns that senators\nSponsorship of particularly the live stream by debt for master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature bent political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Shepherd dot edu\nOh when she thought he he was just under consideration she wanted to get the information across him of rats are now conceding that it may not have been handled very well once the name was passed on to Congress but their point is once that information was out there\nIsn't there an obligation to export fully\nWe have the sports fully\nFacts you are correct it was not handled writes a he had made the short list and that's when apparently there didn't contact me\nIf that data had been brought forward in a regular order that could have been discussing among the comedy like all of these\nTraditionally are that information could have been vetted in those six weeks in which was hidden from basically the majority part of the committee and then on top of it when it was a week and she was not given the information by her own attorney's apparently\nThe committee would offer her a private discussion in California\nAnd she didn't know anything about it\nThat really started it off and made a lot of us think that this was there was some intense or there was not appropriate senator and I think that's still stands today center excuse\nMe I Want to read to use something that judge Kavanaugh said as part of his opening statement last week before the Judiciary Committee he said the accusations against him were part of an orchestrated political hit\nFueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the twenty sixteen election and revenge on behalf of the Clintons evenly Dr ... Ford was put up to this by Democrats who were out for revenge\nI ... I think professor Ford was probably not honor the way she should have been with a request vials individuals who saw political game to begin with and I think and listening to her but I felt very sorry for the position that she had been put in\nBut I also think you saw something else here and I I I read it this way 'cause I watch very carefully yes he expressed the real frustration that I think a lot of us in his position would have\nWhich is always a man who was going to call balls and strikes as you know we talked about him and his judicial temperament to begin with and said you're going to be a straight shooter he's gonna lay it out and what you found was a member didn't hide his feelings he said look you just through four balls buy me one of them you know this one here you're throwing up my head\nAnd he called it just exactly the way that he thought and so he expressed the frustration and anger that I think it was just um and for for for professor Ford this could have been done at a private setting it was often she never got that information because somebody didn't deliver it to her\nThat it wasn't the folks who are responsible for offering the committee that didn't do that\nI hear you just finally very quickly former Justice John Paul Stevens in an interview today said he wants thought Brett Kavanaugh did have the qualifications to serve on the court based on his record but he said watching him and the hearings changed his mind he said senator should pay attention to that\nWhile I I I think a lot of us did and that's part of the responsibility that we have is this this is an and we were there we watched it but there's something else as well and that is as we still have three hundred cases the judge Kavanaugh has issued rulings on that we can go back and look at\nIt shows a lot about judicial determination judicial judge but it's been well respected over an extended period of time what you're finding right now is that I'm a man who's been attacked his family has been attacked Cubans or put a process that literally I think when it's all said and done I think he's going to have a huge respect\nFor the value of someone who is innocent [noise] to to have the right to be innocent until such time as he is proven guilty if nothing else I think that has been seared into his mind for forever more if it wasn't there already [noise] Senator Mike\nRounds thank you very much\nLike you [noise]\nAnd we had a Democrats take now from Senator Patty Murray of Washington state she is the highest ranking woman and Senate leadership I spoke to her earlier this evening\nSenator Patty Murray thank you very much for joining us or Republicans are moving ahead with this vote on judge Kavanaugh they say this FBI report provides no corroboration for these for any of these allegations what did you see in the report\nFor duty obviously I Can't talk about exactly what's in the report but I can tell you that I Am so frustrated and disappointed that it was a very narrow scope if there's one thing we have learned about allegations of sexual assault is that it often\nTakes a long time for someone to come forward and tell someone about it or to be able to remember all the details of it\nThey often just remember a few things that Dr Fortier yourself very um showed us last week and a very emotional way and to not speak to the\nPeople that she has said to talk to 'em really says to me that this is not a thorough investigation and it really is an attempt to sweep just under the rug and move on and that is such a disservice\nTo this nominee to the country and the women who are victims of sexual assault or the white\nHouse and Republicans Senator Grassley are saying this was a thorough investigation they're saying they followed all the lead that were related to the sexual assault allegations\nQuote what we do know is that both Dr Ford and Mr Mir is gave the FBI additional witnesses that we're not contacted so to me that says right there it's not a thorough investigation they also\nSay senator that during a judge Kavanaugh was twelve years as a federal appellate\nNot a thorough investigation they also\nSay senator that uh during a judge Kavanaugh was twelve years is a federal appellate judge there were no accusations against him that what we're really talking about here things that happened three four decades ago when he was in high school and college that it just doesn't rise to the level that Democrats are making it out\nWell let me answer that in a number of ways first of all character and judgments do matter when you're putting someone on the bench on the Supreme Court for a lifetime\nSurvey and it matters because you want to know when you come before them you will be judged fairly so their judgments their character matters their veracity matters and their temperament\nMatters if he indeed did lie to the committee about um what he had done that speaks volumes and that's why this is so credit [noise]\nDo you believe he did lie to the committee\nI Do believe that there is great and gaps in his testimony in a number of various those in the case of forests are talking about Dr forward but also in other areas that he gave testimony to\nSo he farmers like ... and ... when a government that's not going to stand in the way I guess if you move you meant I'm getting this thing in the interviews that I think
