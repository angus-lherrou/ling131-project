tonight there is no firm indication of whether Kavanaugh has the votes to win the Senate confirmation\nAnd you'll nice joins me now along with our congressional correspondent Lisa ... hello\nTo both of you so you ... as you point out in that report originally President Trump was respectful of Dr Ford he was a saying she she was a credible someone who was credible but then the change of tone last night he's mocking her what was behind the thinking there\nWell this nomination has really become a moment of cultural reckoning and President Trump is responding how polarized everyone has to come he sent me the U.S versus we mentality and he's and their last night and he feels as though he wants to to really give the crowd what they're asking for the crowd last night was laughing and clapping as he mocked\nDoctor for it and that's just as important as a president mocking her and this idea that people are really kind of especially Republicans are really feeling energized by this is backed up by a new poll that came out today PBS NewsHour NPR\nIn ... and I want to walk you through some of these numbers um in July two thousand Eighteen the summer\nDemocrats had a ten point need Republican when it came to who thought with who thought these midterm elections with a very important so you have this idea that Democrats really felt as though it was really important but that it's all basically evaporated the poll now shows the eighty two percent of Democrats describe the mid term as very important in eighty percent of Republicans\nAlso described in terms and very important and the Democrats that should be really bad news for them because Democrats have been talking about this blue wave talking about taking back the house even the Senate and now you have a Republican saying this nomination is why I might go to the pole\nSo as so energizing Republicans but you've been talking to people at the White House how concerned are they or are they concerned that this could cost them somehow in their terms uh especially among women voters\nThe president let loose last night so the simple answer is no they're not concerned about this I'm Sarah Sanders said that the president was really just getting a fax he's not worried about whether or not\nLeast or mark healthier Susan Collins or Jeff Flake or going to look at his comments last night and say you know what this has really got out of hand and I can't vote for Brett Kavanaugh so the president is really just saying you know what I'm going to go with my God this isn't a large change of strategy from what I can tell from sourcing it's really the president looking at this crowded thing I'm going to give them what they want\n[noise] now Lisa there's some late day developments on the part of Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee what are you hearing\nA lot to talk about tonight but we just saw a letter posted by Dick Durban ... and number two Democrat in the Senate and he's on the Senate Judiciary committee he posted a letter questioning a tweet by Republicans\nIn which they said that the FBI background checks to this point on Mr Kavanaugh has come up with not a whiff of any issue related to either a inappropriate sexual behavior or with an inappropriate behavior with alcohol that's what the Republicans treated out\nDick Durbin has said we review these files confidentially and that if in accurate what he's saying is passed FBI background checks\nHave come up with something related to inappropriate behavior either sexual alcoholic but you know Judy there was a classic just tit for tat

conference he was questioned outlets by news hour special correspondent Ryan ... who lived in Russia for Twenty years and moderating the panel\nRyan joins me now from ... from Moscow Ryan thank you very much set the scene for today and and one of the main things are you talked about was a former Russian spy shirt extra big conference about a\nThousand people many of them for about an hour for president to arrive and for the front or respect\nFrom the beginning obviously it being an energy home for the subject does\nAh was energy however in Russia sanctions is not a topic that you can ignore they affect the energy sector the affect the entire Russian economy splash president proved and how he intends to do\nSponsorship of the cake you read the live stream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature banned political science and info sessions will be held on Monday October fifteenth MLA dot Stanford ...\nThe name of Sergei Skripal Paul in response to that question president prudent chose to speak about this by himself\nA rash of college and some don't do as much as I see some of your colleagues are pushing this idea that Mr Scrooge ... it was almost some kind of human rights activists to just to spy a traitor of the motherland just to get it from there is such a thing as a traitor the mother\nHe's one of imagine if you had someone Richard\nYour country what would you think about them what would anyone sitting in this room think if we were talking about someone from their own country he's just to come back and that's all and they've just initiated this whole information campaign around this issue\nAnd he didn't stop there I did it he also proclaimed Russia's innocence he\nDid and keep in mind that this was no simple attack on the spy a chemical agent was used this was done in the United kingdom and there were other people that were affected so I asked president prudent about that\nAs being on the side I think there are two other issues one is the use of chemical weapons um and let's not forget that in addition to I'm just going to fall family are being affected in in that attack\nThere was also a homeless person who was killed when they came in contact with a\nNerve agent of a ... [noise]\n... you know this is my first was ... so yeah I sometimes look at everything that's happening around this matter and I'm simply amazed some guy showed up and started poisoning homeless people in them what kind of nonsense is that what are they street cleaners and you can go next this was a really sloppy\nAffair right uh that you had by standards that were uh hurting the attack and that reference there to what were they street cleaners is because\nOf a a homeless woman who died as a result of this attack actually picked up\nA bottle of perfume that the nerve agent British authorities ... had been placed on and used it to president fruit and here is effectively saying what well if we were behind this would we have been that unprofessional of course not Russian intelligence agents are very professional this is sloppy stuff\nIt's absurd to think that such an unprofessional act would have been carried out by Russian agents\nYou also ask him about Russian meddling in us elections not only of course what Russia is accused by the U.S intelligence agencies are doing and twenty sixteen uh but also twenty Eighteen or and what intelligence agencies say Russia is still doing this here let's take a listen to the answer on that\n... uh\nUh I'd like to see the insanity and concerning Russia's intervention in some us elections\nIn for the American political leaders have calmed down and finally work things out amongst themselves so that like we say it will markets they reach some kind of equilibrium balance of common sense insured national interest in that I like that in the process of their own internal flights and so they don't pollute Russian American relations and negatively affected the rest of the world to them and they used to\nTry and that's kind of denial that that Russia is involved in twenty eight team but as far as voting expressing frustration that he and a lot of Russians have that they simply haven't gotten the results of improve relations that President Trump promised back in twenty six ten\nYeah that's right and if you think about it going back to Helsinki when president who met with President Trump a president a prudent told the world that he actually supported President Trump you wanted President Trump to win I should say\nIn the election because President Trump promised better relations with the United states\nSo you you kind of wonder well did he backed the wrong horse because\nIn a way as a result of President Trump or being so compromise by this investigation the relationship with Russia or read the relationship with Russia in the United states is in many ways perhaps much worse than it would have\nBeen had President Trump not actually came into power but you know when you asked president prudent about that he doesn't take the bait if you will he doesn't he's not going to throw President Trump\nOr under the bus as far as President Trump is concerned this is a Democratic Party inspired conspiracy they're just angry at a President Trump for winning the election he thinks President Trump\nWon the election fair and square and by the way he thinks that the Democrats have it out for him and Russia as well so he didn't give any make any suggestion really that uh because things aren't uh you know sort of\nA coming at turning out as he was hoping in terms of Russian American relations he made it clear wasn't gonna blame Donald Trump himself for that\nBut he did have some criticism of President Trump and specifically of a statement President Trump made last week so first let's listen to that this is a statement of President Trump speaking at the U.N General assembly are referring to the leading oil producing countries of OPEC which is led by Saudi Arabia\nWe defended many of these nations for nothing and then they take advantage of us like giving us high oil prices\nNot good\nWe want them to stop raising prices we want them to start lowering prices and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on\nThe Trump is blaming oil producers for high prices are headed to respond to that\nWell pollutant blame President Trump and the Trump administration's position of sanctions that come into effect on November on Iran which are taking a lot\nOn what you're taking a lot of Iranian oil off the market so let supply of oil higher price he's blaming the Trump Administration in fact he said that if I was able to speak with Trump about this better I Would tell him Donald or if you're looking for someone to blame for higher oil prices higher prices at the pump than just look in the mirror\nThe way to spend most of them still let's be Frank these oil prices are at least partially as a result of the U.S administrations own actions and I'm Talking about the Iran sanctions about the political problems in Venezuela just tend to look at what's going on in Libya the state has collapsed because this is the result of irresponsible policies\n... to ... it's best not to intervene in the market it's best not to try and get some kind of competitive advantage with the help of political instruments and tried to regulate prices like in the Soviet Union that does not lead to any good\nAnd some more criticism from a potent on President Trump was about bringing up European efforts to be sovereign in separate from the U.S not only attempts to create a military alliance and Europe separate from NATO but also economic independence from the U.S let's take a listen to what's being said about that\nWith foods to especially when you're doing it but he's in France if I'm not very long ago the president of France\nI think he was speaking in New York directly stated the need to bolster the European Union's economic sovereignty and diminish its dependence on the United states of course that's correct\nYou show 'em so it sounds like we're doing something right um I'll talk about the to risk that you mentioned so\nThe first risk is that we that we moved too quickly and we prematurely and the expansion and inflation never gets solidly back to two percent and that's always a risk at this point in\nSponsorship ... dream by Stanford's master of liberal arts suffering a part time graduate course of study including history literature ban political science and info section will be held on Monday October Fifteen MLA Dutch Denver ...\nToo slowly and the economy overeat and that can show up in the form of too high inflation or you know a financial marking imbalances in that kind of thing so you look at those two risk so for a long long time after the financial crisis second risk wasn't a risk at all\nFar away from full employment and inflation was blurred target so we kept rates low for a long long time and get them to zero for a long time and we had a lot of advice to move more quickly and raise interest rates and I'm very happy we didn't follow the advice because I think the benefit of the country benefited a workers and and their families so\nNow we've come to a situation where unemployment as I mentioned as close to a a twenty year low and head of lower by all accounts and the the really are\nExtraordinarily accommodated low interest rates that we needed when the economy was quite we we don't need those anymore they're not appropriate anymore we need interest rates to be gradually very gradually moving back toward normal\nPresident Trump or as you noted that he started out early on talking about how he believes a fad should remain independent and even given credit for appointing high quality nominees\nTo the fad board but he's also this summer this past summer criticize the fat and the policy of raising rates you write that office\nExcuse me is just politics or does it put some kind of pressure on you or is the chairman of the fat and and does it harm the institution because this is something presidents have rarely done\nYou know we my focus is a is essentially on controlling the control and that we we control what we do [noise]\nAnd you know this is um to anyone who is known our institution over time this is just who we are and I think there will always be which is where a group who\nWe you know we're quite removed from the political process and we we look at the best thinking we look at the data very carefully we try to get disparate views tried to come to a consensus and tried to do the right thing we're insulated from political cycles because our terms run they don't run can continuously or if it's the same cycle is elections\nAnd we just try to do the right things for the medium and longer term for the country and you know that's I think that's why a lot of people want to work at the fed is because there's tremendous satisfaction doing that we don't let other things distract us and and we're just going to focus on\nOn those jobs that just always how we're going to be\nAnd you have a communication private when did the president after he made us coming you know\nYou said recently that you've been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses around the country about terrorists weddings athletes are you hearing\nPeople were concerned about rising material costs tariffs and the loss of markets and supply chains in a big way can certainly supply chains have been\nA you know under construction and now very fully built out over the course of almost a quarter century\nSo they're very important to the way the global economy works we've been hearing concerned about that you don't see anything in the numbers and maybe you wouldn't expect to yet but you you don't see we don't see detect any slower growth or lower investment or lower hiring or any any of the effects that might flow from more uncertainty on the part of business\nWhat keeps you awake at night if anything when it comes to this economy in the world economy\nBasically everything you know nobody nobody wants to central banker\n[laughter]\nYou know I I we we if we get getting monetary policy right at the question you started with this is so important for the public and so we all of us who work at the fed think this is the thing we think about all the time if we're on monetary policy is we've got to get\nThat right and um 'cause the you know the the benefits of doing that are are very bright for the country and you know there\nThough it's a world full of risks many things can go wrong and I probably lose sleep over different things every night\nDo you worry how much do you worry that there can be another financial crash\nMy my guess is that the next set of problems we have will won't look a lot like the last set of problems we had you know I I I think\nThere's we don't detect um\nMeasures of financial stability\nOf financial instability as being elevated at this time they're sort of in the moderate range and in our view view of our staff and certainly in my view so it's it'll be something else you know a cyber attack or some kind of global event those are the kinds of things\nOr maybe it will surprise us and look exactly like the last one but we don't really see you don't see the kind of build up of risks in in the financial markets or let alone in the banking system where where we received much higher capital and actually less risk than take\nMe while we're in the last time your words not mine\nChairman Jay Powell thank you very\n\n\nThe waters are still receding from Hurricane Florence damage which could total well over twenty billion dollars is still being assessed\nThe

created the south Florida building codes for really for when and that was adopted 'em to the foreign building code how do we actually started looking at flooding and sea level rise and and look at our building code and and start to add more measures in there for adaptation for that\nSo I think that's you know something that we can learn from the past and are bringing into the president\nMiami Beach is a seven square mile barrier island that shit slow between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic ocean\nThat makes us a beautiful but vulnerable and so we're vulnerable to flooding obviously a vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise and nowadays are typical rain storms that we would get in South Florida in the afternoon and seems to be getting more pronounced and stronger\nAnd did the spring and fall
