F. N. genetic testing but kind of installing a new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come ... come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention and doesn't you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes your five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that\nExist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what you might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders should we be giving you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and said that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of how secret is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course where we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think\nYou have this very rainy issue of directing future evolution you know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it in embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise]\nHamster and Barry is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the unsinkable power to control evolution you can check out his head talk at ... dot com\n\nHow can they show we're asking a very important question which is\nOkay [noise] like you have the answer to even know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I hear I ever\nHad an inkling of who we are\nThis is Steven Pinker by a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\n... what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell it [noise] there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipment us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack hair so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff ed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with okay I'll do my best\n[noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank sites\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand kids in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century [noise] and then that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nManhattan you know nature from the historian [laughter] God [laughter] Manhattan though instinct and the anthropologist actually not give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nScientists and things and go without ... section of feeling notion well there are number political reasons why people are found in genial foremost I guess\nPolitical reasons why people are found in genial for most states that are here for blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero but if something is written on the slate and some people can have more\nAn others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality another political fear of human nature and the fact that if\nWe weren't blank slate weaken affects mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species to social engineering where we're born with certain things and then perhaps some of them can damage to selfishness prejudice and violence [noise] first of all there\nAre number of reasons to go surfing human mind here's a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that can come into the world where certain temperament and talented doesn't all come from the outside [noise] oh and anyone who\nHas healthy child and a house that I certainly noticed that the child exposed deceitful require human language whereas the house had flown presumably because of some innate difference between them than anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationships knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not English of all [noise]\nSo for years that debate about nature versus nurture has been just a\nDebate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate that who we are\nComes down to both our genes and our environment it's a mistake to think that uh\nBurden [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nSponsorship of the cake you read the
