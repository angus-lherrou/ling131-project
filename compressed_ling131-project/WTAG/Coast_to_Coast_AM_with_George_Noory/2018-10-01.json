I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kind of look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and uh after a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForge testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listen or delivery delivery of those words and talk about the soul to the impact it at our life and not have your ... this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally are respected I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist that Ford is the credible unbelievable\nSo what what I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and they're still in as the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flip completely but but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo ... and Karl Rove showing that a woman is credible\nWho providers witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all when you have a Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering\nAnd the woman who once anonymity to testify turn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all so every time I Try to test her credibility making bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking\nSo one conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\nI think we think Karl Rove yeah completely lost our way because he wasn't telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and men I found Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a notion from falsely accused innocent\nMan who end up in a court of public opinion in the days leading up to this quote unquote hearing his life was completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats and his career with cooking the Harley sabotage\nAnd destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her or she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she has set herself she has two front\nDoors you know anybody that has to front\nDoor bell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she has issues now just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or just because she says Brett Kavanaugh rape or maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far all start feeding evidence\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in Kaiser\nWho would have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAll of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did not get discount more judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place\nWhen Christine Ford's said they did then we'll in Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen but the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about bread Kevin getting the Supreme Court one of his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable\nTo those are like you just mentioned Chris Wallace Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because\n... ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I\nHad the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to beat the post let me tell you from\nIreland and Kevin lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about equal rights and gender equality what do you know what I was treated not as a woman that as a mad\nAt eight percent and bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes in the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us that we find out she was all over the world\nI and also just the

clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities of some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and\nThere's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the drag fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil the evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can\nAnd there have been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah I've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but ah it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it [noise] and uh ...\nIt started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nLegendary raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer

frustrating parts of you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the named David flight is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds\nThey're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent\nAnd listeners to get on and\nEvery time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads the only site that has me is a kennel missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know\nIt's somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us the people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a less effect cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right I'm a ... for a moment about search and rescue parameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use euro went on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that\nGives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nAnd I there have been so many of these cases in in all of your books about little kids who wander off\nAnd are filmed impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often sound impossible distances away and there is no way no way they can walk there on their own or talk about that than I Am\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and a couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida was found twenty miles away through the swamps a another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old ... Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen well these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about and I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail\nWalk away we'll watch the child would set child's gonna do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of\nRanges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nOh yeah you got to be talked about a two year old boy that they traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd even some face down you know the next morning unbelievably why we found that got years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what this is Martha couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe it or what you\nHave a case in the new book a in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on the bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours to have to go watch six miles per hour\nBut kids are going to war for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and left him there\n[noise] [noise] well and and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report\nOn a child who's abducted in downtown and they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away\nYou know sure somebody put 'em in the current girlfriend there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party and anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody sonic cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make a difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L.

did you learn\nSo for people who don't know national monuments are part of the national Park Service it's their property and they patrol it and their national park police are there\nWell there's an ... a location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nOn February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called her well\nI stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff and ask them for any documents on that case I got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any\nI said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles in all the report said that they said that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise] she love the outdoors hike regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residents in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture\nAnd asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he shoot he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling\nAnd found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly you know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that sending to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined Carol was laughing eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service start to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs\nMonth an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent a guy named Matt Ryan contacted carols parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that are that Carol would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seven one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for a review of what it says one additional was turned up on

from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas strip\nYou know that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought you know this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go to\nSam in national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence [noise] so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and can canyon and sequoia as well\n[noise] and when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that crashed in disappeared in the Sierras in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents that things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some or do you have any specifics from the ... you want to get into or should we just go you jumped into the cases of air disappearances in general\nIt was just go to ... parents is\nYou have a case in the books from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that I grew up not far from off the field in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week\nAnd it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise]\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair there was a man by ... earners Cody twenty seven years old an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they ah start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands and Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nFirst hundred and ten minutes to the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then it's seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the blimp [noise]\nWell the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them at ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was there\nAnd then it eleven Fifteen for function cause Moffett Field again stating that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one throw was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were life preserver over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel was in the tanks\nThe radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy boat in a coast guard ship it's all the blimp dip and dropped to ... on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds\nThey said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowd and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there's a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're in the jumped into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nEnded a break with the journey wheel in the sky\nMind them ... and I just log on to ... am done\n\n\n\n\nIs Monday October first what's new today on the free I her radio last\nWeek was all the best ... gas stations halls you want to happen so wrapped up in the late last night on the radio will resume my only experience\n\nYour home is a big investment in protecting that investment is a big responsibility\nMethod than originally by taking those returns listening to Nick and Vicki story about the quiet [noise] ... and ... carrying\n... when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar Sater we need to bring the men of this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever we age list male Macs a patent pending formula was an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases muscles size and twice the reduction of bodies that percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in night for\nA living a condominium for homeowners association you need to think about how your community association is managed is you're bored knowledgeable is your manager trained and certified is your investments saves the eight a community associations Institute has the tools you needed to protect your home and community\nDrain to be next to somebody who you're trying to sleep and we've got that Loughner ...\nYou know is hoping she gets asleep before I come\nOh because I started getting the point where I was concerned about her she wasn't going to get much rest if I came to grab the same time you know she's been so used to me by 'em\nAll the C.

of California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] for the navy did their investigation and they said that\nAh there was no fire onboard when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it dropped one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water there\nWere lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because Jeff north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which had several strange disappearances I've documented and just south\nThe Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat point raise area and nothing immediately half half moon bay so it's one area that has just strangeness attached to it and like you said they they came up with some explanation for that to me that were laughable\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or I mean could that could does not have happened\n... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\n[noise] or even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak right because the\nArea of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said\nJust after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nIs going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened and he went to base in\nAt the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken is if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for ... bucks it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these uh locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to to point at one in particular but some of this stuff certainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO\nTopic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they uh they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered\nAnd as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside he had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked uh ask me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch and I asked a\nCouple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what\nWe would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think it's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call I think\nSo um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to a disappearance that I could sing my teeth into that could related to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but as I said before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water\nI have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation you control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a\nHas a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people have brown there and uh\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch who meets your criteria who's\nBanished like that and I have to say no other than animals livestock things of that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really uh dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought them\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines and no people are gonna want to talk to you a little bit the

want you to know\nMy second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about the the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the blue to\nTalk about what they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true it it was before nine chain Ninety six I used to live in Rochester but\nI was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try to find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a man a woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I have been walking with the mother said yeah\nAnd we shut down at a picnic table and the the strange woman said to the other lady that I had been walking with what's your name [noise]\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground ... without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people that are pure\nWere part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid this is what I Believe [noise]\nWell that's ... that's quite a story or Dave any reaction to that no one interesting\nYou know you do have some uh basketball thank you for calling with that and the the other folks were on the phone hang on because in the next hour or I'm going to be here I'm interacting with our our listeners and um and so folks have you have your own stories and theories than call in and we'll we'll have plenty of time to chat in the next hour\nIn some of your books David and I'm not sure if I don't remember an example here you you reference it about an earlier book\nIn his new book um about the boulders and I I was always wondering well heck there's boulders all over the place how can that relate to the missing persons a mystery you have a couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story my last book one right before this about a story of a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native American thing came upon this giant piece a pink granite in Texas it's a state park\nAnd he said that as he ran up to the top of the granite it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside this Boulder he just made it for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that isn't the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there are stories out of Iceland that\nThey will move road when they're building it before they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder because they have a belief and their society that things are living inside of those boulders\nThey've a ... a missing for one one land air water is the latest book it's as rebutting as your earlier work and I want to thank you for coming back\nFor a million George\nOr will be
