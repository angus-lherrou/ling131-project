work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nOf for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that ... why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um that\nYoung student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all and muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know if a on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something like this guy or whatever and lights would come up a photographer would take a picture and\nAnd the you know fake medium would be totally surprised ... where are you in and say I'm Harry Houdini pull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry write them\nUp that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife\nUh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a and defining in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that\nAnd he I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOf its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother ... already bad the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into this session and\nThen on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she really bond in writing the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or you're with surviving gap and so got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur Ford pursued to anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of who ... his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid taught us I got to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in with a break

P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay um the James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal\nBishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the than says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it\nPuts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened yes\nYes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now since here in my desire to undo this mistake\nHow all those lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue with\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic media those are the words\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com is the both the paperback and an e book and I do want to point out one interesting thing I'm Dr Gary Swartz wrote the book the afterlife experiments and he was a guest with art they'll all those years ago and I have recently heard that Gary sports\nHas Harry Houdini as a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona\nAbout fashion that's fantastic well we'll have to get to Dr Schwartz on the program again and follow up\nOn that yes thank you so much for this\nWell Richard you're an excellent host you have a good heart and the work you do is making the world a

was the road will mean let me just cause I Know [laughter] although Roosevelt was born and Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt fighter Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman that had to change the monitor grammar and part of life actually\n[laughter] um\nYou know I mean this is the evolution of because first\nHis cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nI think it was a second cousin\nRight and and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what\nBecause that was just not the way but he was raised with a that Roosevelt name off that was done anything to find out if he was um ordinarily a full\nOn you know there are special night comes out so he did a lot of things without unsavory would ban some self marrying\nHis focus on on the funding for a\nNumber of Teddy Roosevelt you know that in public there's awful lot of ways so you\nKnow he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York closet you know he was you know he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um ... sort of I I think of George Bush a senior in trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the er the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they will amongst us but they have no idea what the hell were about it's incredible really the ultra rich often when you're

claimed that you know pilots experience so ... and for X amount of hours so I mean propaganda and those are those were walking back down you know it's just\nMaybe it was smaller and easier to have other things so much on the phone while they're at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely um\nIt it's just a couple of 'em or destroyed\nThe point the lemonade changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march coaching so you didn't go into effect until October ... thirty three which meant that rules or at a waiter take off for work so it's mystery\nThing all the hundred pages and they still just average a hundred days [noise]\nUm actually I had one

projection buddy distorts\nSeriously distorts the size of land masses\nSo for example you may have noticed that a while Africa is around fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map\nBoth are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska yet Alaska is much larger than Brazil on the map much larger\nThe map also suggested Scandinavian countries are larger than India whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together\nIt looks like Europe is larger than North America on on these old maps but in reality the reverse is true Russia is in his largest it's depicted with Africa larger than Russia in reality so if you want to see the world is it really is

really get we had already broken the Japanese codes I had a conversation about this with Oliver Stone twenty Thirteen he came out with a series the other side of history I Believe a DVD\nSerious yeah he he came to the exact same thing in this book was was in the middle of writing this back then or research and you know just because I Do all my own research and you know he came up with his own research to substantiate the same thing so\nIt wasn't a matter of if it was just a matter of one that had happened\nAnd so again or or did he let it happen did eat while in part I suppose he was sort of and they were trotting the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much more knowledge do you think\nHe had the actual attack\nIt's difficult to fell I Know they had at least a week's notice\nAnd you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor\nSo they were not it Pearl Harbor when the attack happened which is a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\nPretty pretty unnecessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where a you'd be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting\nSo it was pretty good evidence to support that uh you know the same you know to support that conclusion that said they definitely had a as a matter of fact the History Channel broke it I think last year I was\nWatching something on the History Channel they even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find in the archives that suggests that that very thing that the codes were broken and I thought well hey look at that you

I'm a mutual admiration society going back and forth I think\nUm when Mussolini was still writing for this worker party magazine he admired Roosevelt Roosevelt wanted to send a delegation over to Italy to see how they did things so I I just thought that was kind of an interesting chapter by 'em when they entered the war\nRoosevelt wanted a pact with the Soviet Union to kind of squeezed Germany how did that I did go over with Churchill\nWell when it first started to address your Mussolini thing you're absolutely right with that as a matter of fact Hitler also idolize ... Mussolini at first\nIt was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to get the last um [noise] so America\nGets into the war in Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry in in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way um\nAnyway ah we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England cans are losing their island they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course to have met previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be be honest with you Churchill was the one who\nGot the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because\nThey were so similar to the time that Stalin in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't before on\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the rate for I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communism emotion that\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... billion\nFDR it seemed that the ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we need it Stalin style and and the U.S\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leaving under the delusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional\nDictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever and here he has the opportunity to play a little\nA little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging ... style on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct\nThey have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still looks pretty robust\nOr you know he you know by by the standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I wanted to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads that Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOur communities this drama stars ...
