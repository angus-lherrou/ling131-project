I saw it on a movie or um I saw him walk through the wall or their blood dripping down the wall\nYou know George if I saw something like that I probably never going to another person's\nHouse [laughter] well you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see who the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the last\n... always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the live family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen Everytime she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debt debt\nNow can that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight\nIt off [noise] they can eventually but remember calmer you know be careful who you try to throw under the bar you never know what\nGoes around comes around that is true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know it easily\nTo three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order it's health money or relationships\nAnd you know all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second data it's over right\nDown the toilet so something's going on but if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and how to remove negative energy once that's taken off ... and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you could definitely have a friend do it\nAnd once that is released and gone you find the same thing with health if a person has a curse from them and they've got it bad health\nProblem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you'd have blood work done the tactical now everything is normal there's nothing wrong ... we can't find anything\nBut gosh if you have a curse than you are

ask Sam ... or apologize to them or what did what happened why did we break apart anything like that the same thing somebody that died violently or was murdered\nIf I Can't get to that funeral before that spirit crosses over I Can't give them any law enforcement agencies any information\nBut if that person that was murdered comes in your dream and it was a relative or a friend ask them what the heck happened and you'd be surprised how how much information you can get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo no no or or if they do they're not passing them on\nExactly rent\nFor a lot of people who were brand new to the show marry him want to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were a little girl\nCorrect a well were you\nGrammar realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth tone spirits the problem is most babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was grammar special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gasket but\nHe was fine and he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared that it'd be ... to me it wasn't the dead person as the live person because I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did the did you always have um\n[noise] no I think that the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time\nAnd by so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light\nMake a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds\nIn there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough and it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error\nBecause I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter Karen can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is\n[noise]\nI ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five\nThirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face and and I wouldn't\nGo into houses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but I remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab Ian throw you into the light it still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other and now that I'm ...\nOh there you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five Seventy five year old man does it look at me and go ... Gurley not so much anymore now and I tell them to do something they usually listen and then usually older and then all of\nThem have you ever have you ever come across Marion the double\nI think that I seen him maybe three times or one that we're so evil that they had come from the black\nCool yeah and I\nIf I ever run across that situation now I really try to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get home I'm a religious person somebody that has more training in that field than me\nTo try to get rid of the devil or the demon or whatever it might be\nThat clay that's exactly right and there are people that are game and now just ... it can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform actual systems or things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possession where I had done that and I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do possession I Would end up leading somewhere I really get scratched\nOr or look like GE or something and it's like oh no no no no no no no don't have to do this anymore and that again something that I Would refer to in order to increase\nThat's probably pretty smart we are going to come back and take phone calls

how it's done\nI did that for a week and I sit there on friday night and watch it and they do it anyway\nIt's like oh my gosh and then people would call me and they'd say why did you let them do that it's like\nThey did it on there and they knew better right course they will love would call me up to date because she always got her her script you know like three days before the new one right\nWhich she was good with you she liked ... yeah\nAnd she would call me up and she'd go you should see what the heaven\nMe do I do know [laughter]\nBut yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half hour they seemed to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made it\nDo to Dr James van Prague not well no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming\nWhat do you mean talking about why not look so we're about spirits like the ones I saw so\nNo he was a consultant on the show to are also but he didn't uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a I'm a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a\nA myth barber stand were standing there [noise] and I I looked at her and I my mind would totally blank all I could remember was Victoria Barclay from the\n... and what she was classic actually\nAll while she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd ah and she was found and she was so disgusted with the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in ... the mistake and one of the cameraman said who\nIs the ... and James made a mistake of saying some old time movie actor oh no\nOh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's it going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people like people she said\nNo and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about it in she went in the light so I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screamed [laughter]\nDo you remember that movie pulled you guys in the the little ... little lady kept showing little I don't go into like why why why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that the hip possessions or tricked her something some strange way it changed your personality\nKnow they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when I go for was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and\nIt's uh the person that will take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right\nAnd so and I guess he thought it was really important and he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped you know work on that\nAnd I looked at him and I sort of squint at my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked at me I says why\nDid you put flies in the attic what do you have to do with anything\nAnd he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies have

uh\nYou know not choice to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy\nEither way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him\nWhen he was off a lot of people wanting to be away from the\nWas amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey Ronan thanks for calling\nMorning our way today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are too\nOften Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from\nWhere I live probably rather than our has friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on a ... as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gum CD bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that are in the in the air and I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked\nWith him um and uh yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next\nThing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help\nOn the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people when and\nSo I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name\nLeaders are doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this do that I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you praying and I says yep [noise] and she goes we better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled\nOut of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was a ward and Jesus in my heart\nWould you have these dreams your mind about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like it's in me\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think their game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody into um\nWhere they're going to kill you\n[laughter] I don't think so no I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nYeah it was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time\nBut I definitely felt an odd present I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway and uh it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you didn't hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know I don't you run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but I'm\nA while it was weird\nYou gotta you gotta be careful lotta

issue\nThe reason that they're so concerned about Brett Kavanaugh being appointed for life\nIs that he's not going to do that\nThat's why they're having a collective nutty and doing everything they can\nThis is the most important thing to the liberal agenda to the left is the court if we can get activists on the bench we don't need to go to the dumb voters\nThe racist homophobic Islamic phobic

knew you were retired I knew he was old but Ninety eight years old he has supported Brett Kavanaugh previously\nHe'd actually I think he had\nMentioned Brett Kavanaugh on one of his books talking about a decision that came out of the D.C court of appeals the cabinet authored and said this guy would be great for the Supreme Court\nNow John Paul Stevens is saying he doesn't have the temperament\nTo be a member of the Supreme Court really okay jump ... let me ask you this question let's take you\nDuring your confirmation hearing\nAnd subject due\nTo what Brett Kavanaugh had to put up with\nWhat subject due to what Brett Kavanaugh had to put up with\nAnd see how you react\nI don't think that as anything to do with your temperament he's got three hundred decisions and how could you say that his three hundred decisions were sounding good and this guy should be on the Supreme Court then you see I'm Upset because his name was dragged\nThrough the mud how could you\nSay he doesn't have the temperament I Would say that if he didn't react that way\nNow granted he went a little overboard and himself in the wall Street Journal piece yesterday said I got a little too emotional\nOkay we've got a little too emotional nobody ever said that about any of his uh decisions did you see anyone earlier\nThrough the process of his confirmation until they tried to sneak listen\nThis is this a sex assault allegation did anybody say a you're a little too emotional and your rulings did you remember hearing that during the during the hearings no you don't because it didn't happen\nBut John Paul Stevens said less than I Do think he has a let's put you up against it and see how you react not not as a Ninety eight year old man but when you were younger let's see how you react to it which brings me to another point the media\nNBC has has published\nAccusations against Brett Kavanaugh like like no no verification no core operation nothing and yet NBC was the same network\nThat wouldn't publish Ronan Farrow Z story on Harvey Weinstein 'cause they didn't think it was corroborated enough think about it folks this is the biggest pile of hypocrisy\nI Hope that we
