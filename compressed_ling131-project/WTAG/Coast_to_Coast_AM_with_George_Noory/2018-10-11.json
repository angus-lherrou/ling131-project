around them and I've said this is Molly before she she's never safer than when she's around me because I Would risk my life to protect her nuts and I think that as my obligation as a man that is somebody who\nTries to uphold some standards of of honor for himself or I Would you know if\nWere a threat to her physical safety I Would act\nIn whatever way that I could whatever the costs may be so I I think that often gets left out of a left out of the discussion and a lot of I Know the guys listening to this program I now know exactly what I'm Talking about that the women in your life not just your wife or your girlfriend or\nBut you know the women in your life mom's friends colleagues sisters are are never as safe as well may or in your vicinity because your honor as a man is at stake the

come into the world to be happy\nI'm I knew it was from somebody smart I ... a very ... writer friend of mine is one who set up to me once but it's it's an important point who told you come into the world to be happy the answer is nobody really we are led to believe that by the society around us especially by the more\nCommercial and a self indulgent aspects\nOf the society around this now because we live lives of\nBut would have been inconceivable comfort if even a hundred years ago really\nIn terms of our day to day needs and and all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole and happiness is not just about pleasure naturally worthy that's really where the the breakdown I think comes in in a way that we all exist today\nA Caroline red tape off you said something yesterday that that I've been thinking about for years the regional after so furious and on a hinge and so rabid in their ... stations is because deep down they know they don't have logic on their side\nEvery one of their ideas when enacted results and failure they simply don't have a good historic track record so with logic and facts out the window they react emotionally I think Shakespeare put it best they'd dust protest too much\nShield childcare on the first of all props for getting the Shakespeare quoted the roll call always appreciate that\nAnd on July the less get so upset yes I I think that the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons for their outrage right the the weakness of the arguments is ...\nOne of the reasons that they are so unreasonable when presented with the opposing point of view what people tell me I'm really wrong on something and I know I'm right I don't get angry I tend to be pretty calm and serene and self assured\nIf somebody tells me that I'm wrong on something and my first instinct is oh gosh maybe I'm wrong I I can get a little defensive and I have to be aware of that because my initial impulse is to try and cover up the fact that maybe I was wrong on something I think most people are a lot of people at least have that as a as a response\nBill writes Tom Nichols announced his departure from the GOP in the Atlantic on MORNING Joe usually Morning Joe or rejoice at this I look forward to listen to your opinion on the departure of the expert\nBill I ever had have had John Nichols on the show times in the past and he is a is a smart and we'll read guy\nAnd I think at the end of the day he is a very well intentioned individual when it comes to this country and I just I think he's so wrong on all this I really do and I don't engage with him any more publicly because\nI I don't think that he's fair minded about what he said recently on Twitter so I'm not putting any confidence here but he said that what the Democrats did a Kavanaugh was bad but Kavanaugh's response was worse that's just garbage I mean that's just not a defensible position\nThat because he was snappy with them when they were calling him a gang rape is that's worse than ... than that that's just not it intellectually serious position and so for somebody who takes the position in\nGeneral as Tom does um that there's a lack of intellectual rigor among the Trump supporters I look I think that uh I think he's gone down the wrong path on this one he's not the only one who used to be a conservative\nAt least he's honest though I you know give him some credit for this he says he's a Democrat and now because he is he's a Democrat he so disgusted with the right that he is now playing for team left but I'm more okay with that than people who say oh I'm Still you know they pulled the Jennifer Rubin the Washington Post oh I'm Still a Republican notion that\nI'm Still a Republican I'm just going to crash

don't exist there they go against the standard model and that's what blows me away I was going to hurt when in Tennessee I currently on ground zero\n[noise] Hi Hi I'm I'm I found this topic very interesting\nAnd uh um so I did a little research on the train because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from the sun\nRight during my research I found out they were getting you know from a number of sources are ablaze or large metallic cloud um\nAnd and the supernova Nineteen eighty seven eight ... and and um and and the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried so very very deep in the ground and they have to be extremely large\nOr what what are you where it came to my attention is this was an anarchic go where are you know at the polls a media writes in in media or they're they're all they're they're found very easily in ... and it's commonplace to find things that just fall whose faith\nIn in that and touched reaching the ... of our planet right\nUm so you know it came to mind a lot of tension that what if while they were building this neutrino detector system has to be so deep underground\nSo large that they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been style you know ... and and and that may explain these new or a microorganism\nWas he that's it you know it might be if y'all out from from whatever they may have filed was building this detector so the question is\nWhat is the fall out why does it go against the the uh when they called the classic model these go against everything the classic model opera see right not son particles\nHe's aren't new part these aren't these are not neutrinos for this on these neutrinos from perhaps a quasar something else these neutrinos from or what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is it is it something that doesn't belong on this planet\nIs being ... to prevent ... into space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them was perpendicular throughout pointed and we're finding their detected large numbers of these\nAre coming from the polls you know that that that's that's a that's all right out and to make our magnetic field or\nOr whatever even affect the trajectory of beef up the drummer particle right and ... and you know if it is really concerns me 'cause well you know they they detect it has to be very deep underground in meal with a water\nAnd in in order to you know to detect neutrinos\nThat large numbers of\nIt has to bounce off a particle right ... ... a heavy water ... you write and what we did it say every ... molecule it creates a flash that the detector can detect it left how they detected neutrinos now while they're building this incredibly large apparatus this you know this is the\nHe's the trainer detectors are not quite ... not quite as widely known as the um had drawn a collider right at least those things are ... miles twenty miles law in in circumference\nThat leads to take these tree or detectors they're not quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of a gargantuan nature and when they're taking down into their eyes that has not been disturbed\nOr hundreds of thousands of years I mean I'm we might they look they may have found a a a a thing literally yeah like the movie\nYes the thing is if they're\nIn and and they could open a planet up to something we're not ready to him\nAnd they and that's why they had to bring down the Russian Orthodox a patriarch a president turning his day\nAll the all these our all of these\nUm um public figures in and politicians in and scientists to before for what you know it it it's scary\nCome really come see what we discovered come see the alien that we've discovered come see the the the creature that lives on practically nothing lives on Aaron sunshine doesn't live on any food lives in harsh conditions\nAnd look what is putting up putting off neutrinos that are not the classic model sending a signal out into space and then we're getting a signal back and this is why we're so concerned about tech technical signatures SETI\nThey could just do the microorganism whatever they found charity you know we carry microorganism bacteria in our bodies are foreigners just to live just for us to survive\nYou know we have good bombing that part right now ... wherever they found that may be their farm and it may be very first to our biological system\nSo they're keeping them contained there obviously but they they're they're they're certainly concerned\nAbout the signatures it's giving off there certainly concerned about what we're hearing what we're watching this the the fast radio burst the ... the the

movement\nShe's the author of several read books including the field and the intention experiment and we just the power of each lose the editorial director what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn won't come back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing ones last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when several weeks ago a Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could you know the category four or five and we did a little much bring it down in a ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens they're worth something\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep that uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ...\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up the St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things\nAnd now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purifying water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided the trend of the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has is good or record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow he'll think the experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries\nI was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also a very prominent is rarely a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid cold Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide through self off of forty foot structure after his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage he had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot jar ah Gary Schwartz at the University of\nArizona noted say colleges and a Jessica us\nWho is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones who were sending intention to so we had no real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of\nMy uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together and um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the ... the why me why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the power of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nI was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really done many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's what I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young\nWe we different brainwaves signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group we have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us have worried doubt negativity\nSo these are basically brainwaves signatures somebody who'd feeling a sense of the data one\nAnd when we compared these signatures when the scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie so that um we looked at\nOther things like the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monk any static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a female after my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was twelve minute video for me\nTo do when we're gonna take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of age and some of the incredible things that can be done with the

we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all of a brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nervous scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest nerve the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that\nWe um you know we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending loved to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group\nThat Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be that would be an interesting for\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday I'm doing a pilot experiment like that in\nThe mail is county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror what does that\nMirror effect to me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intentioned experiments\nSo when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment\nLives became more peaceful they were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers they were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me was the amazing thing about it\nMirror effect and when we did healing experiment we had loads of healing when we had these experiments we had loads of people finding their line we're more peaceful\nIn a way that's probably the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to the people\nIt changes your life partner\nLynn we're going to come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few

know intending for you for your health fear happiness or something that's really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases with my master classes for instance when I put people in group they're total
