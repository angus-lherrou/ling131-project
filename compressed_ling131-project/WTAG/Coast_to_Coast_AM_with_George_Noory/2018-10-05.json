Callahan Fox News the Senate is expected to hold a procedural vote fraud and all the nomination of Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh the outcome will be a key indicator whether Senate Republicans have the votes for confirmation\nAnd there are certainly people all over the world right now they would rather rule for other reasons you know maybe it's just that I've been watching too much American horror story apocalypse but my dad that God if you watch that\nThat's a lesson in in the fight between what is the dark powers in whatever powers out there in the midst of an apocalypse\nPredicted programming revelation of the matter if it would be increasing globally should a globalization of political and economic institutions it's becoming easier for a relatively small group\nTo deceive itself into quite staggeringly influential positions and one couple in particular reveals alarmingly what another small group will do is driven by financial belief systems and a cold things and all the things in the shadows all the things that can reach out and grab you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there are many conspiracy writers and observers that tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate that has control over the world the spiritual realm\nBut what is it the thriving right now in the midst of globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex things that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back and read and understand that's why I come in every day\nEarly\nAnd yeah you can go through all of the bad guys the masons the jazz with accusing them of controlling all of a spiritual realms of what appears to be the same period called however it becomes more complicated\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or priest craft that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it\nBecause of what I've studied my my entire life when I when I put into this program every night every major step in the development of the new world order from a simple ideology to a worldwide super states can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards this order and it can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\n\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I use the the the word sin anarchy\nThere was a guy by the name of a Joseph Alexander said hives\nAnd\nHe\nHad an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\n\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy top by an elite that his pre destined to rural absolutely at odds with the band emerging concepts of democracy and so he decided that the only way to win\nAnd to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so he wanted to transmit the secretive synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual fathers of ... of course the knights Templar and other groups that you know actually spawned and and and new ideas and\nAnd mysterious mysterious subjects and hidden meanings and certain conjure rings and all these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark state or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker\nType of rule of dark command that actually\nUses the darker powers to create a sin arcade may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into towel but what it is it is a government of some kind of group of conspiracy of men or women that form a priest to it and are ruled by a secret society open societies are not always the\nOnes that are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing their power plays within the United states and within the world\nThe formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all conspiracies met from there there were other conspiracy groups other secrets societies\nAnd I know many Christians in America believe that the ... one of the United states was based on Christian values and ideologies business half true\nBecause the rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely Syrian any bordered on things like her medic arcane them announced the system so from the very beginning we've always had that group\n\nThat are simply observers they they they're custodians and they make things happen and they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\nTo the apostles do the disciples to those who've adopted the views of Christianity Islam and Judaism and they're against the general teaching of any gospel whatsoever any word there would be connected to a God a God that they don't approve of\n\nAnd they are on the opinion that the dog was if any gospel are not good for anyone\n\nAnd this is why the ruling oligarchy in most respects has a secret doctrine which is reserved for the elite\nAnd this is why when you see things happen that don't sincerely seem\nGodly or or Chrysler like or or or anything you you look at the symbolic language you look at the actions yoga numbers and all the numbers in the symbolic actions in the language and all of them are puzzle pieces to a greater picture and not always do you have the greater picture and even I don't\n\nThat's why you know I gave a few clues gave it a few hands and I said a couple of nights ago I said you know I'm not gonna give you an exact date I Can't give you a decay exact date or anything\nI'm not here to tell you the world ending I\nI that would be stupid to do something like this and many people say that many people are used to the idea that people who talk like guy talks are wanting to just gather everyone together and say the world is ending do yourselves then that's it no I'm not a cult leader I'm a talk show host\nAnd know what I'm Talking about it's not magical thinking it's really pattern seeking it it's it's basically acknowledging the a lot of the coincidence is that I haven't seen lately are meaningful at least to me they are they\nMight not be they might not be meaningful to you and it can be intentional or unintentional but I see that there is a confidence stricter a foot with what is happening between the uh the situation with the the poor cabinet meetings the FBI and what's about to be set [noise]\nWhere the votes about me\nAnd as I said and I always say prepare yourself for anything anything happen after\nWhat Trump is not really what it exploded including if anyone\nThe devil

had it ran during the\nTime I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo I you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population is increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to catch them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates filled out it's because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record\nWhat it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment in the constitution\nSo I think he's apt to sort of bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to give some of the moderates you know problems and so but my guess he he's going to be confirmed probably as weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things it's done it's it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned

Gilligan with his hat you know and we were watching and blew my dad and I think with a lot of these movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies the kind of be with my dad and I he would be in the recliner watching creature features and I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometime\nThink I think women spend the money so I think that a lot of horror film but I think one has kind of been made and even with this new car or a with this new Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to take that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women and these movies that evening star wars you know and now the doctor who was a woman I think that you know it's a it's a it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies\nAnd they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of wind five five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to twenty what percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter] not really [laughter] Fifteen to twenty\nFifteen to Twenty years old yeah I I I Would\nI Would say forty percent I bought that alright twenty to thirty\nTo thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I skew that little higher maybe maybe fifty percent\nThirty to forty per se is usually\n[noise] thirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I thank you yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that maybe maybe twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year old and and beyond are probably a much much more likely to enjoy a film in their home and the trouble with going into it to be\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them\nAnd bone only well whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to I mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it but I I Can't remember the last time I was in an action ideally I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film and the theater with an audience but a lot of\nTime we'll let you ... and that's your ... your business\nSo I I'm I'm biased because I'm watching the audience ... ...\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who'd take calls next hour and addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call in and uh let's ask you if you win the last time you went to a movie\nOr you know what's interesting too about movies\nHow they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals\nAnd these incredible songs and people were dancing on them in the movies man those those days are gone\nMaybe they'll come in never know maybe they'll come back you know maybe George you know maybe you should dust off your tap shoes [laughter] you and I could make up all singing all dancing supernatural for\nA dime a single George never was a tap dancer [laughter] to me I just saw a clip on YouTube Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly dancing\nOr to take me out to the ball game they sang it has to do what and they were magnificent together I didn't know Sinatra could dance like that no no I was surprising has always\nSeen hundreds of years in the cartoons that rail thin swaying next to a microphone I don't really think of them dancing\nNow it's truly remarkable now are they still coming up with good horror films these days\nI kind of do you know you had mentioned the conjuring a movies\nI last five years ago it was good that was two thousand Thirteen was in it I guess\nThat's true but they're still making them there on the I don't know third or fourth conjuring spin off by now I think\nYou know what I think ... the ... movie\n[noise] yeah yeah they're rebooting that they've got a brand new no way and they're they're they've got their starting over with a fresh Dolly O. look pretty beat up\nAnd they'll sell the ... as a dog won't say\nThey'll sell the dog the dog the only thing that I think is is is it still does it look like a toy elite looks to bike or ... you know they should have looked at all like um you know they should look at like cabbage patch get the stuff from the eighties and and try and make them look\nMore at this ... this new one I'm Talking about try try to make them look more like a like you made of plastic I think to eat overly ...\nOther than Amazon dot com now the toys R Us is closed were the people buy toys for their kids\nYou know I think conventions I think people I think uh you know fans by toys that convention with an online and and it's too bad that there are you know a really great I I K be I heard it's coming back and you know I I Hope that maybe you know maybe there'll be some some smaller I'm\nA ... that will kind of cater to um collectors because electors by you know adults by more towards the kids I think in you\nKnow I think that they're probably you know if they had exclusive like Comic Con with stuff there have toys you can't get anywhere else and I think target and Walmart they that to where they have toys that are loses I think if you had\nUm toys that you can get online where you have to walk into a store and and by either you left out you know that might be the kind of thing that you know kind of a attract that mind set us up collecting ...\nWhen I did about a year ago is I went through a list of all the board games I played as a kid and they probably don't play 'em anymore everything's video\nAnd I wonder what was your favorite ... go to go shoot tiegel was great\nI loved the monopoly I'd love to clue that was fun\nI went and bought them all on line I bought all these games in the box I've not even open the box and like unlike gold baseball cards which I threw away just putting these away and my kids we're ... we're looking at them one day when they came over the house\nAnd they went in what allergies and [laughter] I said one day you'll realize that they might be worth something

people dressed as it goes so flying through the audience that touching people and and uh uh we had um\nA you know all kinds of gimmicks and nurses in attendance and uh you know prize giveaways and I'm a ... a lot of corny stuff\nUh but those shows used for law they would travel and it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because you know the the theaters didn't want to give up their eight o'clock movie or their ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are flow wall and they would they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie\nAnd they they they would rent the theater out a after hours and they would show these uh shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted his neck\nA and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they didn't have matinees for kids to 'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out maybe have ... goes made out of a mop that we're dealing with phosphorus\nIn and they would they would uh you know they would have these chains that would be wrapped through the bleachers and they would react with them back and forth and it would make all the chairs vibrate and they'd all these great uh you know that they would put the they were put weird stream and ice water and\nThrow them out in the audience and they go down to the back of people's shirts and people will be feeling this cold\nNoodle going down the back of their shirt you know um there was so many fun kind of carnival type gimmicks\nThese guys did and they would go from town to town town and sometimes they do three movies back to back um with all these great gimmicks there'd be a magician and by show act you know people putting nail through their nose and all that stuff\n[noise] what's the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember without\nJob so literally absolutely I think that that didn't have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOf people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen or you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and they're kind of emerging into their adult life\nKind of a ... thing that they can go in with their friends and you know they might uh accidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you\nKnow people who who met met each other a sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married ever do that I've ever as I've I've seen that I've seen the shadow cast in the states for a performance that goes along with the movie performing very very different markets all over the country\nAnd over and over again I flew people who were mad at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely find your people if you if you really are into that\nHouston, Texas regal Robert's with us on the coast to coast hey Robert go ahead sir\nGood morning George and Mr Lovell either like you would call and I'm sure enjoy the show thank you I'm\nSixty one years old and I haven't been to a theater so it's about three years ago

the TV down very low and lay on the floor but to be from it it would be able to hear it but where everybody was sleep you know it was called um black Sunday [noise] [noise]\nOh yes with Boris Carl

[laughter] but the white Christmas uh there was a ... a killer that was terrorizing sorority sisters who all lived in the same house\nAnd she he was calling them from inside the house\nAh that's where we pie that's creepy\nUh and uh but uh there was also yeah it's it's a very creepy film a really well made structured horror film John facts and it's amazing in it and it I'm a template for a lot of those kind of movies from the seventies\nAnd I'd like that that guy went on to make corky [laughter] you went on to make a Christmas Story or a lot a lot of other films and different genres\nBut

got to be here and how are you what's new I'm good at it\nIn a while right I think that we're living in an extraordinary time thing right now and that just trying to balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how did that happen [noise] well I started\nWhen I went and rebellion head in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with being somewhere I shouldn't have done what somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time at the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver room my body\nA motorcycle and um\nI had a real tangible\nOf body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete\nAnd I think there was something in that moment that\nSuggested any way that consciousness is more than just our physical\n... and then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up\nMy leg you know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... ... ... and being a good and pure assist which means you investigate everything\nYou have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember them on on it\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on the kitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking\nI drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness\nSomebody once you were wrong\nI guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raise their luster when I was Twenty years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then the marsh first places I was too were Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked at all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know well\nI was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my modus motorcycle accident\nYou're born heights really yeah well he told me where cars you must remember there's the the street oh I don't I don't know who was ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\n... I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes you'll remote viewing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill new Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf it more than your back your my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nSuited ... really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and socialize or apology you've just been elected a vice president of a Psychological Association will get into the but is this will lead the foundation for you\nWell I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a worldview kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nAstronaut regard and\nI didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe so few university no\nThat's right we are looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological lens\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that\nKind of notion that there are\nAspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough the understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... bill just like the beer right\nIt is any relationship with your family\nWell you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery what she'll remember\nRemember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThey do they do they still college which we're you know I don't know I have a really a double up minimum yeah I'm sure\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat what have you ... what have you learned about near death experiences above the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste\nA sin that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's\nAn expression of intention uh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any during the ...\n[laughter] every day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was developed out of the work of Ernest backer who wrote that great book a denial of death\nAnd they have found that if people\nAre you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of\nUm personal worth their their value in the world and you you enhanced their self esteem\nYou'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people so I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think you can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know agree Mitchell before you go on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter]\nUm but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he\nFelt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving unkind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that's you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed we're descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you are like quarter law mhm she knew this was challenged ... was challenged could you prove that there's life after\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and lower you Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge in a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what one shift people's mind\nAbout that question and is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but employees with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think\nAgain we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware and that we have what's called in attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers us a point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting\nIs reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery ... is filled with life and with that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nTeach ... exactly rule will science ever meet\nThe spiritual ...\n[noise] I think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's the robot\nWas

A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com call now\n[noise]\nWelcome\nBack Dr Merrill Lynch ... with us Marilyn in this reality court room how do you think the jury would decide based on his third wife after death\nI think most people believe there's something there I think people have had\nExperiences that give them a sense that I think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know beyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location hormone viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is it's something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their life\n[noise] and you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and fuller and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspective and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation and and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHow little younger people react to these things now what do you think well\nI think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with\nI you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see\nSo what's that about you know is that about just something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the latter maybe what's happening\nWell let's take some calls will pick it up by going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either Giovanni\nHey how's it going your great I mean it's been a while\nIt has been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as
