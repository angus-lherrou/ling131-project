about going to church getting good grades and volunteering at soup kitchens\nI unfortunately haven't well schools in this communication style by nurses just at the behavior of all these types of participants was appalling but unfortunately rather familiar\nUm and a bunch of privilege prep school kids with way too much money and freedom and no supervision I saw some of that when I was in school and his anyone remember Animal House that movie made its mark because it was real this was not a fantasy about space aliens\nUm those yearbook entries tell the tale beach week Ralph club a hundred and ... run off the alumnus and the most telling devil's triangle which basically describes him as sports does happen with the two boys\nHe dismissed them all with Lindsay explanations that would never succeed during questioning by any parent or principal or dean doesn't he realized that many of us were there and it's counter shows usa two or three people are like I got I got to tell you I'm\nI I just disagree with everything you're saying Sally and and I say that with respect I think that you are\nI Can't say misinterpreting but I think that you are not properly contextualize ing\nHow a person like Kavanaugh would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and try and supposing that onto a man when it doesn't matter if other people have done terrible things when they're in prep school it doesn't matter a fraternity brothers are off in\nA in coherently drunk and there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual did cabin on do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no and no\nAnd I also think that your your being far too kind to Dr Ford's very selective memory and her recall is such that she cannot be challenged on anything and she's only certain\nThat Kavanaugh's the bad guy I find that a little too convenient I don't believe it I\nDon't believe that her memory is accurate\nMaybe she believes that this happened to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events square\nThe reality that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to either convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so don't feel like I'm In any way trying to shut you down or shout you down I I just have to tell you why I strongly disagree with your entire\nPremise on all of this um or I should say I disagree with your analysis on all this max\nRight hey by a with a new FBI investigation look into the will the new FBI investigation look into the new accusers background where we learn is lousy for ever had a substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWill we learn when she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six years ago\nMax let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for why is it that lousy Ford\nIs a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that none of that can be discussed that meanwhile Kavanaugh can be trashed\nWhy is that because he's accused I'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe it for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment to the notion of sexual abuse is something that has not taken seriously I reject that by the way I think the sexual abuse has taken very seriously\nThere's a reason that sexual abuse in many different ... you know many different iterations is a very serious\nFelonies people go to prison for a long time so I reject this narrative it sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nJennifer I'd say their pocket cash listener here first thank you for being a voice

description under oath long did I miss something and this new cycle it's possible know Jennifer I don't think he missed anything I think the two questions test\nSeemed suspect me all along and I think that the whole polygraph in the way that they have been trying to hold this up as the biggest piece of objective evidence they have I think that it's\nA I I think it's a scam quite honestly I think the polygraphs aren't used in court for good reason and I think that we should all be very clear that what's going on here is all coordinated if you didn't want and she didn't want to come forward\nWhy don't you take that polygraph no one's ever given me a satisfactory answer answer that question no one\nRaymond ... unrelated to current political happenings I've heard you speak briefly

I. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first of all\nSure well that's a that's a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations that I say this is the uh the third station the United states is man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations and occasionally somebody come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew or knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities now want renewal energy [noise] plus or minus\nThis hundred percent renewable thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply\nThey can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal ... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure or something\nThe studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this is a hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nWhich talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution out there\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nOr no they uh all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times to one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's\nFairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted no I've\nNever had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of which cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's

Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm and\nThat inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what these protections\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie\nWell as the events portrayed in the movie to thousands well with yellow stone popping the cork in Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under there you have to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nAh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the the theory basically\nWas that are warming would cause a\nCause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nMuslim slowing down and really not happening\nIt was a good movie though\n[noise] yeah okay this is an actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll egg and they'll make it\nStill doing the same thing well okay go ahead you're on\nA Monday morning who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're\nWe're talking about wind field when I when I was living in\nOregon okay and I used to drive by the wind they all that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was up by plenty more boy booth\nFlame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas while we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity now\nCome back and they had no no no ... going to cost whom I Can't have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think there are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise] ah they also want to get methane from water\nTreatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh\nUh agriculture um the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor spoken to him several times I heard him on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot than they are saying that\nSay that these are climate\nChange hopes are uh are using a bag lady I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion ... it's\nQuite a few of those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four dollars a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject man and a a ... a\nA young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's frosty has told us is that isn't just sat in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or will somehow going to a massive really improve their lives they're doing All right with out is just lost the will ridge a lot of them are\nAre counting illegally into this country because they had been tricked and seeds into thinking they're going to get a better quality of life and they had down there because you're having a lot more money

have for us growth are stable force\nSo there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was not an avid we at all for us and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age\nNo scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise to hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big uh port on in in the\nNorthwest Italy an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans\nWere higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what the what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension I perhaps where a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gum and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that isn't\nAt the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky if they don't doubt this a lot of ...\nSandler harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite maps but\nHere's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure is on coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather\n... when I hear about it and the new Luskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce IQ\nBruce said something I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just said it exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe that the way to Adam is being gay oh engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the blotting out son well people are so much heck shoes were hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's to the point now where you can go to the street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes if they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got to geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was foolish idea didn't may never come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nWith Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing is gripping the oil industry all nations away describing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China that's over there with their sky completely on pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play out now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLong he's somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the

I was afraid that you sent me originals\nWell here's what happened to George and this kind of humor is um when you produce that had contacted me uh I had an order and four foot they're actually made to order on Amazon and I had given all of the copies out I had and I had I mean\nI had it in order and fruit punch bowl [laughter] and that's it I have nothing to send George [laughter] so I said I

don't know nobody knows\nBut based on the fact that they leave prints from both hands and feet a according to some testimonies they bleed having been shot a\nAnd they die as well getting into a little

people have every walk of life or in\nCountering them uh\nHaving said that uh we\nWill get into a little story later that out of hand picked for the coast audience\nA and I have a couple of them are that do involve a UFO phenomena\nAnd my take on that is that there may be some mimicking going on here of the natural\nOkay the UFO suit so I think I think there's two I think one's almost like an

we're here with William ... the author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on us\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was ah canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was pulled urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a channel\nZ doing up here now he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so one that was up in the high tree he could see it and\nWant to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and won't position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees them ruffling in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess with this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with the kids in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited zoom they are out in the rural areas right\n... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a involving no sighting but evidence like it's ...\nMore credit card you usually hear them warm sorts Munoz free\n[noise]\nOkay\nWell comeback William she's with us William the abominable snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time to call\nAnd they form this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman a speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought it looked clear and they could sit there and rush for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea\nUm I have a Sanders since book the abominable a snowman come to life and uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature\nA and yet getting back to what I said earlier\nOf this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taking everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think

interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being shaved so they were spending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS\nUh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green

he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one or the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it

around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees\nAround it so that the parents and that\nI mean it it it's a glowing orb of light show
