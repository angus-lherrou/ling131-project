little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff 'cause they're gonna they're gonna do is that on our dollar\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollar know next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much as it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their

filled the pop back up with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have

I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats\nHated the Republicans for defending him in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really the I think that the social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans say damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff and the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements and this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be ... I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example of that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd it's hard to argue mid hatred on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always the nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the sole thing you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kinda like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack too because we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter]\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got to vote is going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our in our newsletters that\nNinety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest moment in global his\nLaw you know Harry I've had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September a ... you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy yeah and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we're we're in the same position we're coming into a truth out seeking marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made it finally caught it and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when in the markets were out of two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming and then all of this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nI'm an we're running out of tricks I mean what can they do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not good to win reelection I was just going to say\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and they may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or it best when Trump holds on\nNotice after we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing pass next the next year but there is there is a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFrom the forty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit in China made the biggest ... was the only stock market it violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up even but it's still\nPilot but the U.S markets looked like the ... going to open up two to three hundred points

see well back in Florida the clean up as the guy\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nVery and welcome back to the grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within the can you predict out five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation where they would predictably spent and when they would stop spent ... so yeah what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George is that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics or we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing with the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty per se there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more money there\nSo you could buy these battles and things like that everything from gold\nIron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah but next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than ... after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference\nOn George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boomer so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shoulders if you want to call it a real estate and more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more people dying and selling homes and young people at the next generation coming in buying so when we just for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boomer\nIt's just like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be a solution to be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption or around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time\nAnd then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this ... they need us or our trade is three times tilted\nTowards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that and we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nAhead of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and we're going to kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up we go the keys in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricanes struck and because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having had a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd uh the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here ah in New York former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are letting\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with the Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times in\nNobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we would so I think that's kind of a good thing\nWe're in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became of it this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and there there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike Harry with us for coming back from final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast\nGet Daily Show up the

lines\nWell but I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few lick then because I Want to charge twenty three sixty six the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts [noise] they're\nGonna have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructured their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation is\nCome along so I I my bet is\nThat they're going to come to part we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and\nAnd and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing and the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTwo thousand eight Uri I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nIn a ... you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust sin if you know send period to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefitted corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend that red line them but you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they got you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite and the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have takes procreate money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nOkay thank you\nAnd I think here I just think that part of one of my questions but the more I asked\nA direct them I got one of my parents were flying a lighting up on my head and you move on line\nRight yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that kind of one of my guarding the looming comic um how can I tell you that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much as um as a larger accounts hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out in a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people gonna hit for into positives more Iceland\nWent down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a\nProtected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't pay they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Carrie thank you were on a time here ...

breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message Barry now ... says well welcome to the program Dr many meat is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor's bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he told by his patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many ... that that [noise] um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back to talk to him in ... in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans that they had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of brush them off yeah I just thought well that was weird\nBut I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah\nThat was that was quite dramatic um that at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells don't it it's called an aloe Jeanette transplant mhm\nWas more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer I just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said we can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but\nThen I Would keep having relapse and that fight eventually they gave me the parents find huh [noise] now the person who gave me the ... he was an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him the death happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and they hear\nAll for them you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab\n... that's it yeah\nThat that she slept to get the DNA that's when his name entered the donor bank\nAnd then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him\nSome injections to stimulate his bone marrow the produce more stem cells and they gave him these injections for five days\nAnd then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live in but yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm has that help or hurt your psyche ask your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the\nTwo things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the U.S psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed to the last um spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost a loved one will have some type of post death\nContact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist and agnostics have these experiences while as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you OK but\nUh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP\nOr telepathy or the cognitive beams and other things you talk to both touches visions hundred voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP\nUntil after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that first and then you say oh you must be ... that was just thinking about\nYou right was that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nFilled in there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show her no\nThat's terrible ... how did you get so interested in philosophy\nShe just always was and uh there were some things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it and the big white\n[noise] well that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying deemed to let the see\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had a fender than receivers\nAnd the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab\nAnd they were hooked up to the teeth and um the AG could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... the average rent dream state the Centers for giving random images and they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them to be seekers and they found that people were more susceptible to telepathy when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more\nSusceptible to love to see when they're under hypnosis\nSo there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise]

bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this film you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study\nThat was done in a hospice with dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which on the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say is coming from something they've added or we could say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear mhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other governmental leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and there were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the dream telepathy studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know how they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible\nAlthough we don't really know and that and how how could we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it\nThat I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I thought I I just saw these where it said\nThis is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition knew about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she'd done that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate he ignored who plays also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their promotions do maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should go after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregard things which could be dismissed that superstition there's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was the horse racing boat yes his friends apparently really\nUnderstood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else in Washington and Dr seuss in movies screaming and you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe\nThey don't believe in also\nCreative getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there was any parts of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body during during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up a book to tell the doctors nurses\nUm what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his docket high and of course the doctor was founded\nThere was another case for the blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and ended up giving everything that was going on and then when he when he be covered and they couldn't find where she put it that you\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were wild yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and that can get spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people\nCall them fake cakes and people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or Mr colder mysterious is relative or it's being used to describe the same event so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every parent normally there but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] oh definitely I think it improves quality of life for people to feel like there was something more out there that we don't have to live in nine to five eight and a day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think a chick explored\n... when we come back with

experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the fake it from a psychotic experience for example if someone here the voice\nI'm a psychotic ... nation tends to be very very frightening it's also a frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides boy\nIt could be a town of machinery and in fact it may be more than one voice too with the voices talking to each other about the earth and\nIt might be accusatory or threatening where I'm psychic aloof nations and can be ... feet when they may occur only once or twice in a lifetime\nThey tend to be a reassuring and climbing yeah the thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at one symptoms such as hearing a voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause fake ... major mental disorder which affects the ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other him aside from the of the nation fix them ... or paranoid I ...\nOr you know feelings have ...\n... people are talking about and that type of thing so that more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis if they\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is that conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened and it's a psychology that did an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patient while they were patients they were actors pretending to be ... that they were misdiagnosed as its authentic they're admitted to the war they were giving medication they didn't take\nMedication
