I didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew\nI was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but\nIt was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea\nAbout the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah\nWell it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... you need that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh\nThe indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not\nThe source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe you realize\nThat you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the system's information the dean dean why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms yeah\nAnd not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything no\nOf course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they ill meal you know he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an addict and mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's\nBy solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity\nTo experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there is no\nUm when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them in

think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nOr as cars science has been part of that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they are non mall over or their vibrating\nOr they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean ... these when you are when people are going to be travels the experience to ... the brain argue make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to\nMap brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery were twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught any more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these what is a mind near twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah higher self with are multi dimensional self right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nThat sounds great information on your website and let's say by the way it's ... ... ... dot org and there are ... resources on

he's talking\nAbout ... Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute sedative or sixteen thousand participants who have\nGone through the ... e training at and then we'll Institute Virginia and he's come up with a commonly reported to nominate on associated with these will be wondering if you could explain this to our audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying\nThis and practicing for forty\nOr just to go on my website astro info dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys and our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way\nAnd it's it was amazing how similar the\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds\nAs a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through colors dial it if you're seeing through your clothes dial it's at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you're having it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at a for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that's the dance on it because that happened if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think it's his muscles and nurse you're saying that's an out of body say\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experience or have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body such with sleep is mhm we take it for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the feeling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nAnd what does it look like image\nYou're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream can they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't ... biological machine mhm and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess or play ... and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game\nIn life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask a question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and\nAsk that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how the difference between now and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification of what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left of specialty uh religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this ... and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of first out of money doing things for ... years old and he will require recount Canton and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but it declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the

I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience I mean nobody is it you can't not right\nYou know like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ... leave your fear\nBased if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a double a or Satan\nAround every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have light you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space and that's what people forget it and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're protesting\nBut each thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do she experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and try to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like this negative energy if you are going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell your creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person you don't know anyone that um\n... owns a motorcycle and\nIt was and it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak the honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we are scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know if that's an adult locked out of body travel\nMost likely mhm well it could have banned but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn these what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right it's the gravity we're used to\nYeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our\nContinuing existence yes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they want to thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his left sandwiches astro info dot org you'll find out about all of his books and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to talk about his Colorado and some of the great history was forgotten tales that's Colorado's Sylvie back I only see you're listening to ... and\nEven now he is my guest non family great doesn't cost\nAnything you're ... these problems [noise] in eastern completely voluntary [noise] first I was afraid to go to Alan on like a fool to care about somebody you can [noise]\nAnd then a lot [noise] and then the new deal but it's not totally out of control\n... you Mickey supposedly you\nCan learn from people like Colin ... linen ...\nThe analysts braille and audio real UGA G.

I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional storyteller from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen\nI Swear that because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was that in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts violate just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really run down\n... extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house and five years\nAfter five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house with what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going right oh yeah\nI actually called the owner's son\nAnd he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and he goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song that just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like\nThis while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you jumping Malone blew\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking\nAnd about a ghost named sue oh [laughter] I\nTheir weight true north or south was gone and you know they have to have a little piece of hepatitis crystal in their brain and\nIt was the he was he was feeling that maybe because of these magnetic anomalies bred for hunting confused because they were actually behaving in a very strange manner\nBy like diving into buildings and and like ... how the pilot [laughter]\nInteresting it really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about manatees Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am with the guardian listening to coast to coast am\n\n\n\nAnd\n\nYou\nKnow that the ban may and if we can twenty twelve record label bosses at BMI recall the vinyl anniversary edition of the Beatles single must do after discovering they accidentally printed version that includes session musician any white playing drums Ringo Starr copies\nOf the disc referring the wrong version reportedly selling on ... um\nThere's this we walk home\nWe all make promises big small\n...\nRoom\nAround them learn to\nVery\nThe long\n... you know your guest does Lisa gar\nWelcome back because because I Am I just want to give you a quick reminder that I also have a great\nShow on the guy a network along with George ... who's got beyond belief myself called inspiration on guy and you can check it out at informations on guy at ...

bit more about the ... we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there wherever else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage it springs for spiritual reasons is because\nOriginally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe out there where paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nAnd the ghost is gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that it is\nNo longer with all of this worked out beautifully [laughter] needing\nNow had she's seen the operation of this not since\nThe book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand sixteen because the theater had just\nBeen sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball ... this was reaching out that's partly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes but you seem to be the you'd like to publish this for the east coast and the [laughter]\nYou I have made it is it's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goals but like other little girls that bounce a ball isn't she do I'm like no leave in ... ... and friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nThat's really not if they are they're just picking you you've tricks or it's here they are in\nPrison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil is finished and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely get picked believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning\nBut I find the best time to\nActually look for growth if he wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time\nWhy it's the if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hidden lends\nItself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes that does it make strapped when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now haunted him did you met with non hunters salute lead the gas\nI the ghost follow you\nRight yes they do on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath ... lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would\nOn when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by a\nWell it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah you have to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life I\nUsed to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nHave you tried to say it's happening it won't so yeah\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic trick somebody you don't really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there\nAre there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's the\nEssence part rain there oh yeah that you know this family hotel right there on that an eight of them is very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a\nI have heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down on managed to springs and vulgar and even as to part with S. with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up\nLight up with the red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine as you're\nRight there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the world of the pikes peak they believe was the naval\nOf the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\n[noise] you know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very low fat Ernie I Love this stuff [laughter] pikes peak it's very

we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the more spiritual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in\nThat particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well um pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. A. T. that are have a I think that's what the native you used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe\nI just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhy why would call that connected to the mother okay yeah\nIt's connected to the mother and think about the native is the way they must've looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nA father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it on during the pikes peak gold fresh produce more cold than any place in the whole world I\nHope I have that right than here I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers the flight over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHearing will cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw UFO when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it's cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships and they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards it other than it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons\nWas totally before there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because\nToday if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but before we had or a governor ... experiment gone exactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm\nErratic flight plan exactly up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter mhm a fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now\nSo what I did was I followed it\nI followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not that it's a lot of people yeah\nBut a lot of people thought that I mean just outrageously crazy and he followed his story in Kansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing and the story was consistent very much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly with farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um we you know we've had the telegraph you [laughter]\nYou think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years\nWe would do [noise] and
